If they post it, maybe a manual review can happen to determine if it was hate speech or not.

Frank Waddell, associate journalism professor at the University of Florida, noted that “If you see a bunch of individuals online who are leaving negative comments on a news article, you might think most people are evaluating this news as low quality,” Waddell said. “When asked to evaluate the news yourself, you might also think the news is more negative relative to someone who reads that same article without comments.” https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.

While freedom of speech is a human right, it is imperative to be cognizant of the fact that each and every person has the right to have their rights respected. It is for this reason that readers comments cannot be removed. Everyone has the right to make a comment and we do not necessarily always have to agree, we always have to respect. A system can be put in place to remove any vulgar language.
__label__Support	This does not remove comments altogether	We can fairly reduce hate speech from newspapers websites without eliminating space for readers comments by encouraging people to give a reward who will comment without hate speech.
__label__noRel	This is a fair point -- maybe removing the influence of comment sections altogether will stop the trend of news increasingly becoming 'comment' and being less objective in reporting. If people want to exercise their free speech about the article's content, they can still share the article and express their opinions on it elsewhere, like on their personal social media channels.	The way to fairly reduce hate speech is to use a mix of technology and human intervention to manage the potential volume of moderation required to provide a healthy environment for discussion. There are a number of tools available that allow for pre- and post-moderation to curb the worst excesses of user comments. This can be further enhanced by requiring readers to give a little more data about themselves to reduce the anonymity which provides a cloak for the potentially worst expressions of hatred.
__label__noRel	It is possible to express opinions without being aggressive, but that doesn't mean people will do so. Online arguments often get very heated and can quickly devolve into hate and personal attacks- this should not be tolerated in forums meant for discussion of news	I think this is a task that is hard to do because it has to be done in a way that would not hinder freedom of speech but at the same time not attack people. Thus, I think comments should be flagged depending on the words used but not be deleted until it has been checked.

Although this is not a UK based news item, it is an example of how information can be mis-used.	Agreeing with others here: a standard of moderation would have to be communicated to the user, with straightforward policies of flagging or reporting potentially hateful comments. A synthesis of live and algorithmic moderators might be best, as certain words can be auto-flagged for review, whereas other things might involve a more delicate touch.

The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.

__label__Attack	You may argue that it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police their comment sections. Having said that, perhaps the relevant question you should be asking is whether it is in their best interests to do so. That is, even if it's not their moral obligation, it may STILL be in their financial and functional best interest to do so. The prevalence and salience of hate speech may signal to audiences that the newspaper tolerates (at best) and endorses (at worst) the hateful commentary appearing in their comment section. How do you think this would impact the bottom-line of the bottom line of said newspaper company? I would argue: Not well. And how do you think this would impact the ability of said newspaper to reach future audiences? I would argue: Not well. Individuals disgusted by the appearance of hate speech may be at an increased probability of avoiding said newspaper website in the future on moral grounds. Consider, for example, individuals who boycott Nestle for ethical reasons.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Newspapers and free speech functioned well for a couple of hundred years without instant comments. People used to write letters to the newspaper, including their name. The newspaper would then publish some letters anonymously. This meant that people were protected but offered well considered opinions, rather than abusive or nasty comments. Perhaps a slower postal system encourages better behaviour rather than an amplified Twitter-esque school-yard of bullying and abuse.

__label__noRel	I think using AI would not prove to be very effective.

Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.

__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	I was completely taken aback by some strong stances to remove the comment space, and the belief in that because Newspapers should be one-sided providers. I would disagree because newspaper share societal information and society should be allowed to engage and be part of the conversation instead of just consuming whatever information is being released for consumption. It has been seen as a result of other newspaper websites removing the comment section that it reduces the trust of the reader because they are aware of the bias of the information they are consuming, and also it reduces the amount of time readers spend on these sites because there is no community engagements.

__label__Attack	giving away personal/sensitive information	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	I think that moderation is the most effective way of preventing hate speech. Filtering comments would not work as it is difficult to find a algorithm for the context of a comment. Free speech is so important it should not be removed.
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	most people seem to be of the opinion that cutting comments altogether is not constructive. A good point was made by an individual that viewing opinions from people you like only doesn't help you to grow (echo chamber).
__label__Support	I agree that this question is subjective to an extent - news matter varies and can often be divisive or challenge certain views. However, I think moderation could first take into account the relevancy of certain comments (i.e. personal quips, etc.). Bullying or other clearly offensive comments (racist, sexist, ableist etc.) contributes nothing to a discussion, so it should be moderated. Comments that lend to the wider argument (however contrasting) should be regulated at the newspaper's own discretion.	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.

I don't think hate speech will end with the end of anonymity. We have to think about the possibilities of safety for human rights activists that only come with anonimity.	Be more strict when allowing people to create profiles, that require identification before allowing anybody to comment. Stopping people being anonymous enough to feel confident while posting hate speech I think will be more beneficial than restricting peoples comments.

__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	I don't think it's fair to eliminate comments from newspaper articles because the public is entitled to have their opinions heard. The best way to deal with hate speech is to moderate each comment before it is posted. Also the newspaper could ban accounts who engage in hate speech in the comments section. This moderation could be done through both human moderators and software to find trigger words signifying hate speech. It's important to democracy that citizens can have their say on the issues that affect their lives.

__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes.

__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	The common man has a say in policymaking as he will be the one living under the new set of rules, he will be the one who will be most affected.

__label__noRel	By monitoring the comments, it will make decent people to enjoy the platform and it will make the website respectful	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	Persons can become very insensitive and offensive in the opinions given, especially in the unmoderated comments forums.	I have found that as well as reading the articles from newspapers, I have also been paying keen attention to the comments section of the article. Either on the newspaper site or on social media. I find that while the opinions of the article presens the views and research of the author, the comments offer an alternative viewpoint and opinions. A chance to see if the article hit the right note, and an opportunity to understand positives and negatives of a topic raised.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	I do think that people just comment on things even if they don't have a strong opinion about it, just because it's easy to. This is why I feel they wouldn't act out in another way if the commenting platforms were taken away, as they inherently don't actually feel passionately about an issue enough to put energy into opposing it.	I think that a comment section is necessary for engagement and exchange of ideas but having said that, there should be a code for AI embedded within that platform which will be able to detect hate speech or words classified as hate speech then the AI can delete them automatically. Also people can report the comment and the AI should delete the comment within minutes of it being reported.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__noRel	Yes I agree, but guidance on acceptability and respect is often needed	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	I tend to agree with this. In this way editors have a close look to what opinion can be published and which one entails hate speech.	Freedom of speech can be used as catch-all term to justify the use and propagation of bigoted and hateful language. If we accept that some language is not acceptable due to it's clearly hateful nature then we have to acknowledge that some form of censorship of those particular instances has to occur. I would suggest that eliminating all such spaces from newspaper websites would have a massive detrimental effect on valid, non-bigoted, freedom of speech a cornerstone of western life. We don't ban all cars because some people speed dangerously, we monitor the roads and ban the bad drivers. I suggest that as long as readers comments are monitored continually they should remain.
__label__noRel	Unmoderated online comment forums are magnets for noxious speech. For years they have carried people’s discontent out into the world, while the writers sit safely behind screens. It’s almost bittersweet to think back on the time we once blamed internet flaming on the online disinhibition of middle school pranksters. It is the many unhappy adults in the electorate who are posting the things they are really thinking in comment boxes. Nearly three-quarters of internet users – 73 percent – have witnessed online harassment. News website comment sections host antagonistic conversations between contributors. Nine out of 10 respondents of a Pew Research study said the online environment was more enabling of criticism. The squabbling can be overwhelming: As many as 34 percent of news commenters and 41 percent of news comment readers identified argumentative comments as the reason they avoid reading or joining the discourse. Multiple studies show online communities develop sophisticated norms that guide participants. Anger begets more anger. Unshackled digital vitriol is now volleyed back and forth online from all sides. Some commenters don’t even care if they are anonymous anymore. Researchers have found real-name comments on social media are actually nastier than unsigned commentary. Historically, American democracy always had some rudeness baked into it. For example, during the presidential election of 1800, incumbent President John Adams’ campaign proclaimed “murder, robbery, rape, adultery and incest will all be openly taught and practiced” if his opponent, Thomas Jefferson, won the presidency. Jefferson, meanwhile, described Adams as “a hideous hermaphroditical character,” with “neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman.” Civility in public discourse is often what people in power expect of their citizens. Demands for civility can be used by those with authority to deny power to those with none. People who feel marginalized or alienated use incivility and civil disobedience to fight the power. By causing offense and indignation, as we saw during Campaign 2016, outsiders gained massive attention for their cause. Yet “democracy only functions when its participants abide by certain conventions, certain codes of conduct and a respect for the process,” wrote cultural journalist Neal Gabler in an eloquent essay about how a hateful electorate threatens democracy. Gabler noted that the 2016 presidential campaign was referred to as the “hate election” because everyone professed to hate both candidates. It turned out to be the hate election, Gabler mused, “because of the hatefulness of the electorate.” He went on:https://theconversation.com/how-news-sites-online-comments-helped-build-our-hateful-electorate-70170	By the whole nature of the newspapers removing this ability, who is to say the newspaper itself could be potentially spreading hate news?

Rather implement ways in which one can refrain from hate speech	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	It is easy to be hateful online when you are anonymous. Before being able to comment on newspaper websites, users should be required to sign up using traceable methods (eg. some form of identification).

__label__Support	That is a great suggestion, that way, we all get to voice our opinions and the newspaper doesnt censor the views of their readers.	By moderating the comment section.

__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	The author of the post can moderate all comments before allowing them on the page. This does present the issue that only the author's views will be portrayed

Proper moderation that does not tolerate racist, sexist or any other discriminating behavior or hate speech.

I believe that people are allowed to express their opinions , that is why we have freedom of speech.

Considering a newspaper is a public platform, I believe everyone should try to be respective at all times. The comment space must not be removed, it helps to get insights of readers and is very helpful.

Also, comments should be monitored before being posted to the public.

__label__Attack	Even if someone provides their personal details many people are still not deterred from commenting hate speech proof of this is that in Facebook where most people have their personal information they still comment hate speech in the comments on posts	We need people to supply their personal details in order to limit hate speech
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	"I found this really interesting, ""Khan said the freedom of opinion and expression, including the right to seek, receive and disseminate diverse sources of information, must be upheld by States in times of crises and armed conflict as a precious ‘survival right’ on which people’s lives, health, safety, security and dignity depend."" This is similar to what lots of people have been saying regarding worrying that this sort of censorhip could overextend.

__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	You should be allowed to give your opinion to express your view about a news article. To moderate this or to filter what you can and cannot say would it stop it from being free speech. What really needs to be looked at is to see how you can stop online trolling which I think is the root cause of some of these comment sections become so toxic. But for the media who is so depended on free speech themselves so that they can report on news in an unbiased way to eliminate the comment space is almost hypocritical. Just a weird idea here but perhaps you should do a quick test or verification before you can comment. A lot of people would not go through the effort of completing this if they just want to spread hate.

While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	"I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that ""less restricted"" criteria should be?"	I think people should be encouraged to give personal comments however they need to be monitored to ensure hate speech cannot be seen which might negatively impact others
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.

__label__noRel	Removal of hate speech is not too much power, but hate speech needs to be clearly defined and a set of rules adhered to.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.

Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	In order for effective moderation to occur, some kind of consensus or clearly reachable policy on what constitutes hate speech (including dogwhistling, which may be less clear to a lay viewer) would need to be in place. This might require too much buy-in from commenters, but is necessary if anything can be consistently enforced.

__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	most comment sections usually generate comments that turn into arguements if unmoderated	Have something that sensors specific hate words and filter them out
__label__Support	Guidelines and some automation (i.e. flagging the use of key words associated with hate speech, including swear words and racist nomenclature) could work.	People tend to comment just to rile others up, which means it will be a lot of work to moderate. Perhaps an all or nothing approach is best.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	Hate speech is a form of self publicity.

An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.

__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way.

Maybe as a moderator I would try to understand their viewpoint because by removing the speech there will be just more anger and hatred.

__label__noRel	Yes, any form of hate speech should never be tolerated.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	Eliminating space for readers in its entirety removes any possibility of stimulating discussion. While hate speech is a serious consideration, I would hope that it forms a small minority of the comments posted on newspaper websites (but I guess this also depends on the topic since some are more charged than others). Surely some form of regulation would suffice to address the severity of hate speech.	Removing the comment section will not solve the problem. It will just create a filling of censorship and will make debate and dialogue vanish. It is important that people discuss news topics and also give feedback on those news to the newspaper. It is important to moderate this comments in a strict no hate speech way and bring accountability in. Eliminating comments will just hide a problem that needs to be fixed by moderating and educating people.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way.

Some root causes of hate speech originate from child hood traumas and are deep, i do not think that we may be able to tackle those just for the comment section hate speech.	We do have to allow people to express their opinions - we can't pretend opinions don't exist. Having them out in the open lets us know what we're dealing with. But at the same time hate speech can't be allowed to flourish and absolutely needs to be challenged.

There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.

__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	I think you could ban some words or have someone checking the comments and deleting the ones that are unappropiate, but limiting the whole comment section would be a mistake

__label__noRel	A combination of volunteer human and algorithm moderation is already used on sites like Reddit. While it's not perfect, it's less rigid than fully automated moderation and allows communities to set their own rules.	Hate speech is a form of self publicity.

__label__noRel	Yes, I think this is the right approach	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	Controversial topics should be decided on how sensitive the information or event would be to groups that are targeted with hate speech due to protected characteristics e.g race, religion, gender, sexuality etc.	One solution to reduce hate speech is by disabling the comment section altogether for most important topics/controversial topics. Yu can actually leave the comment section open for generic topics/non-contoversial topics.

However, I am not sure how this would work from a data protection point of view. It is certainly a start.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	I still think a filtering system of removing categorically hateful words could help a little, but there is still the big problem of other comments bypassing that. I think an independant and unbiased moderation team could help to remove the issue of the newspapers removing valid critisism or comments about inaccurate reporting for example.

The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	Alternatively I'd offer the opinion that goes against the question and states that we shouldn't offer a space for readers comments (and thus hate speech) at all on news since it's primarily a site and source for news. Systems like https://ground.news/ have been providing news and removing bias without a social aspect already and since third party social/sharing/commentary sites handle discussion and the problem of hate speech far better than newspaper websites presumably can hope to, the solution seems intuitive: remove it and let that happen organically on other websites and platforms.
__label__noRel	This still poses an issue with what people think is acceptable. You run the risk of people joining in as opposed to call it out.	In my opinion the comment section should not be removed. I personally get very annoyed if I watch or read something and want to express my opinion, then go down to the comment section to sadly find out the comments are turned off. This limits the freedom of speech and blocks the ability for the people to vent out somehow. I think this builds aggression and causes problems afterwards. The better thing to do is to limit bad speech, foul words and cursing but removing the comments completely is not a good idea.

If there was a system to remove hate speech it needs to be automated with an algorithm that catches certain words, then reviewed manually when someone disagrees with the content removed and it not being against guidelines. We use guidelines for everything including media regulations for accurate reporting or having to retract when information is not accurate. It's no different in the comments section, it doesn't remove free speech it regulates it to create a healthy environment to have a conversation in. Over moderation can have as severe of an effect as under, it has to be a system that takes in common complaints from both sides. Not the hate speech side per say but the sides of people who are pro free flowing conversation and those who want more shielding to avoid extremist echo chambers.

Their entire business model relies on discourse and to prevent that is to deny readers/users the very service they claim to be providing. Some kind of voting system would allow harmful comments to be surpressed by the users themselves. It should really be left to the platforms themselves to figure out a way to manage potential hate speech (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00550-7#Sec4) through their own platforms as they have a responsibility to both limit harmful speech but keep discussion free and open.

__label__noRel	Whilst I agree that the platforms should be responsible, with the vast numbers of people contributing to some platforms it is virtually impossible to moderate every single comment.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.

We all have freedom of speech but it is our responsibility to ensure that our speech does not cause harm on others.

I'm not sure if newspapers simply choosing not to publish readers' comments (which is what they are doing by hosting those comments on their site) is the same as censoring free speech. By this logic, anyone who writes a poorly written opinion piece and submits it to the New York Times should get it published, because otherwise their speech is oppressed.

Systems like https://ground.news/ have been providing news and removing bias without a social aspect already and since third party social/sharing/commentary sites handle discussion and the problem of hate speech far better than newspaper websites presumably can hope to, the solution seems intuitive: remove it and let that happen organically on other websites and platforms.

Restricting any form of speech (even hate speech) could lead to hateful views becoming unchallenged and potentially result in violence.

Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them.

Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them.

Education in media ethics: The first step in combating tribalized hate speech is realizing that, while the right to free expression is a fundamental human right, the rise of social media has produced a number of different channels for its creation, packaging, and transmission. The rights and liberties of journalists and their role in fostering and developing peaceful societies should be emphasized in media ethics education. The political, social, and cultural rights of individuals and groups, including the freedom of expression, must be made more widely known, as well as the obligations and societal repercussions that come with press freedom.

We use guidelines for everything including media regulations for accurate reporting or having to retract when information is not accurate. It's no different in the comments section, it doesn't remove free speech it regulates it to create a healthy environment to have a conversation in.

__label__noRel	There could be a risk with this. In an article from 2016 (https://www.jstor.org/stable/44014621) Flaxman et al. make the following point in their abstract: 'the vast majority of online news consumption is accounted for by individuals simply visiting the home pages of their favorite, typically mainstream, news outlets'. If this is the case, it's possible that the 'diverse' opinions will be in a cycle of one sided shared opinions, and few 'other' or opposed opinions. These could well end up being quite extreme, and the policy to include other opinions could well serve the opposite function of promoting hate speech when it is a massive minority.....maybe.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.

I was completely taken aback by some strong stances to remove the comment space, and the belief in that because Newspapers should be one-sided providers. I would disagree because newspaper share societal information and society should be allowed to engage and be part of the conversation instead of just consuming whatever information is being released for consumption. It has been seen as a result of other newspaper websites removing the comment section that it reduces the trust of the reader because they are aware of the bias of the information they are consuming, and also it reduces the amount of time readers spend on these sites because there is no community engagements.

Moderating comments sections is a lot of work to do manually, the individuals tasked with it would burn out in short time trying to manage that effectively while also having to read hateful garbage all day. If there was a system to remove hate speech it needs to be automated with an algorithm that catches certain words, then reviewed manually when someone disagrees with the content removed and it not being against guidelines. We use guidelines for everything including media regulations for accurate reporting or having to retract when information is not accurate. It's no different in the comments section, it doesn't remove free speech it regulates it to create a healthy environment to have a conversation in. Over moderation can have as severe of an effect as under, it has to be a system that takes in common complaints from both sides. Not the hate speech side per say but the sides of people who are pro free flowing conversation and those who want more shielding to avoid extremist echo chambers.

__label__noRel	Good idea but an education policy would take time to be effective	Many people are against the reducing of hate speech from newspaper article, and I am with them on this. The main reason for putting comment section on newspaper websites was for readers to leave a comment, people will always have something to say whether it is good or bad. But AI can still be used to remove comments that can be severely harmful.

__label__noRel	It would have the advantage of searching out offensive words prior to them actually being printed and could be stopped before they are.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes.

Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__noRel	This would reduce comments that may be derogatory and or offensive and in some cases discriminatory.

Recent political positions in the UK have lead to more fighting for 'free speech' and saying that it is ok to be offended - this is shown in a police news release (https://www.college.police.uk/article/protecting-freedom-expression-updated-guidance).

Brexit was the decision of generally uninformed or misinformed people who can't be blamed for it. Especially the ones that actually voted to remain or the ones that didn't get to vote at all. The truth is that the UK was always sort of the 'black sheep' in the EU. Even historically, the UK was often somewhat 'detached' from European politics and issues.

__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Moderating comments sections is a lot of work to do manually, the individuals tasked with it would burn out in short time trying to manage that effectively while also having to read hateful garbage all day. If there was a system to remove hate speech it needs to be automated with an algorithm that catches certain words, then reviewed manually when someone disagrees with the content removed and it not being against guidelines. We use guidelines for everything including media regulations for accurate reporting or having to retract when information is not accurate. It's no different in the comments section, it doesn't remove free speech it regulates it to create a healthy environment to have a conversation in. Over moderation can have as severe of an effect as under, it has to be a system that takes in common complaints from both sides. Not the hate speech side per say but the sides of people who are pro free flowing conversation and those who want more shielding to avoid extremist echo chambers.
__label__Attack	What if the moderators are biased themselves?	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__noRel	The issue at hand is not the total elimination of hate speech, but whether it can be reduced on newspaper websites. A newspaper must responsibly manage its public platform, and giving platform to hate speech is a problem it can manage. A newspaper is, by definition, not a forum.

__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	There needs to be a level of moderation before comments are posted. Comments that are harmful, false or misleading shouldn't be allowed to be put up, but there should still be room for healthy debate.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way.

__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	I know this has been discussed a few times potentially in reply to comments but I'd like to repeat it again: language is complex and you can't simply ban or flag certain terms or phrases and think you catch all the hate speech comments etc. While a report button and the use of a software that can support a human moderator is in essence a good idea, it might also delete comments that do not actually contain HS or completely miss others overall. I think this decision by the newspaper turned into an entire discussion of manageability of monitoring discussion sections and away from the ethical considerations.

I agree with the notion that being able to share our thoughts and feelings is a right and having people share their views can help people to question their own thoughts.

I am still of the view that comments with hate speech need to be filtered out because each individual needs to be responsible in their speech.
__label__Support	I think adding chat bans for repeat offenders of hate speech could help.	I think removing the comment space is just avoiding the problem.

After doing some follow up reading from https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/what-is-online-hate-crime/ I have seen how the anonymity of these online comments can be what makes it so easy for people to be hateful.

__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	Having read all of the previous discussion surrounding this debate, I still stand by my original opinion. Moderating comments by an official representative of the newspaper doesn't allow for free speech. We do however, need to eliminate hate speech. I think the best way to do this is to put this in the hands of the community and other readers.
__label__noRel	Absolutely correct. The important thing is to identify what hate speech actually means, because what is offensive to one individual might not be to another.	If the aim is merely to reduce hate speech then I think eradicating the comment section goes too far. Why should people not be allowed to comment and have their say. The newspaper is punishing the public for the crimes of a few. It seems rather unfair. I think the best method is to have monitors.

Recent political positions in the UK have lead to more fighting for 'free speech' and saying that it is ok to be offended - this is shown in a police news release (https://www.college.police.uk/article/protecting-freedom-expression-updated-guidance).

I think the first step to reducing hate speech in readers comments should be in the form of a moderation team in which they filter inappropriate comments. I think it should be a group of people rather than AI to do this to ensure all hate speech within a variety of contexts are eliminated, as if this was done by a computer there is risk of hate spilling through. For example, hate speech on the social media platform Twitter can often be missed as users purposefully misspell hateful speech to ensure it does not flag up on the AI searches, going as far as hateful language misspelt actually trending on Twitter.

__label__noRel	There is no reason other than egotism to be against such a proposal.	We need to strengthen the participation of citizens in the design and processes of the EU
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	It reduces hatred	I think that any 'contributors' should have a profile and should not be allowed to use an alias. I also think that there should be moderators looking at every post before it is published online.
__label__Attack	sometimes these tests help identify people's strengths.	Intelligence tests bring more harm than good
__label__noRel	Implementing these can have a favourable outcome.	If eliminating readers comments is out of the question, then it must be that hate speech is recognized and removed before a comment is even published. People use the free speech argument but free speech isn't 100% guaranteed in cases of speech causing harm (e.g. Yelling fire in a crowded theatre). Hate speech causes harm.
__label__noRel	Sometimes people do need to be censored, especially when it comes to hate speech because sometimes those words become actions and people get assaulted in real life. Words spoken online sometimes rally people together to take action (for example what happened in the United States when people stormed the Capitol because of fake news spreading online about the voting results being fraudulent https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/06/election-misinformation-helped-fuel-jan-6-capitol-attack-now-climate-misinformation-threatens-planet/ )	"Is space for readers comment really that necessary?

__label__Support	Freedom of expression is important for ordinary people to express themselves; fight injustice and support marginalised groups. Regimes that depend on achieving and holding power in undemocratic ways see free expression as a threat and restrict or close down the internet.	Debate should be available upon all topics. To reduce this availability reduces the opportunities for people to express their opinions and undermines democratic processes. Hate speech should be managed and eliminated before publication.

__label__noRel	true, but maybe they can remove anonymity so that everyone can be accountable for what they say.	I don't think newspapers, who have already seen their takings plummet in recent years due to everything moving online, will want to pay to employ moderators for their articles.

This topic is a massive minefield and I don't think there is a simple solution to it.

__label__Support	True, but not every criticism is valid	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	I agree	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

__label__noRel	I agree. Just moderate the comment sections a bit more.	The comments could be examined for offensive language. For instance, there might be a robot that scans comments for offensive language and deletes them.

__label__noRel	I agree, I think some people are unaware of what can be considered hate speech	My final argument is that it is possible to monitor and reduce hate speech on website comments by using both AI and human intelligence
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	We should halt all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries into the EU. However, if we want to stop this immigration, we must stop its causes. Indeed, it is war, poverty, and European, Chinese and American neo-colonialism that make the people of African and Middle Eastern countries flee to Europe. So Europe must finally take responsibility and protect these countries from corruption, war, and neo-colonialism and help them to start their economy.	The EU should establish a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)
__label__Support	subsidies for vocational education would help solve the problem of skills shortages in many trades	We should subsidize vocational education
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	people feel powerful behind an anonymous account, its easier to say things you would never normally say under the guise of anonymity, if it was easier to link a comment to who it came from and if people actually faced consequences from posting hate then this could help stop it.

__label__noRel	we cannot remove reviewer comments altogether. i believe a method to filter or censored hate speech is necessary.	I think that fully blocking comments being allowed is detrimental to free speech, therefore comments should be allowed. However, there should be monitoring and banning of certain individuals if they are found to be continually hateful towards others.
__label__Attack	I believe if almost everyone who knows about hate speech will know what to say and what not to say.

Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.

__label__noRel	information	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed.

Stopping people being anonymous enough to feel confident while posting hate speech I think will be more beneficial than restricting peoples comments.

__label__noRel	reflecting on this, and the use of AI - here is a statement from Facebook about monitoring hate speech and now allowing these comments on the platform: https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/policies/community-standards/hate-speech/	I believe that people are allowed to express their opinions , that is why we have freedom of speech. However with that right, we are not subjected to hate speech, there are so many ways of expressing yourself without using offensive or hateful words. Considering a newspaper is a public platform, I believe everyone should try to be respective at all times. The comment space must not be removed, it helps to get insights of readers and is very helpful. I think the website should be enhanced in a way that it detects offensive language and doesn't allow the reader to continue if they use such. Also, comments should be monitored before being posted to the public.

__label__noRel	It is nice to think we could reduce hate speech.	A possible way to address hate speech on newspaper sites would be to incorporate both human moderators and some sort of AI that monitors for hateful words and comments. The requirement to submit personally identifying information before commenting might also help because without this then anyone can create a fake name that hides the person's true identity so therefore more likely to engage in hate speech. If personal information is required, then hate speech would be less likely.
__label__noRel	I agree	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

It also gives right of way for those who think with pure ignorance to voice a factually incorrect and exaggerated opinion. These are not the types of opinions that should be openly shared or taught on the internet and in any given situation that it could happen they need to restrict it.

Community moderation is used on many platforms to allow discussion whilst preventing hate speech from arising, however this is greatly dependent on human participation which can take a lot of work depending on the size of the community. Additionally, the removal of hateful comments can better a comment section, but will not change a commenters views- this has led to the development of more insular online communities fostering these more extreme or hateful views. People will create a space for their commentary if there isn't one provided (or if their comments are removed from somewhere). A lot of this comes down to what a given newspaper wants to be associated with (in the sense of their brand) as opposed to maintaining the sanctity of online discussion.

__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	It has been shown that comments sections are popular and do drive traffic to websites and make people spend more time on the site (so pleasing advertisers) So from a commercial/publishing point of view it would seem that some kind of moderation is the best way to deal with the problem and not eliminate the section altogether. (See https://webpublisherpro.com/your-website-needs-a-comments-section/)
__label__noRel	No censoring of opinions	Completely doing away with the comment section would not be beneficial to the readers experience as reading other peoples thoughts is what sets online media apart from offline media. It plays a role in keeping the discussion going. It would be smart to rather monitor comments to ensure hate speech or utterances of a vile nature are greatly reduced through the use of some sort of algorithm that picks up on problematic words and deletes comments or it being done manually by people who will moderate the comment section.

__label__noRel	Beneficial to the masses.	I know this has been discussed a few times potentially in reply to comments but I'd like to repeat it again: language is complex and you can't simply ban or flag certain terms or phrases and think you catch all the hate speech comments etc. While a report button and the use of a software that can support a human moderator is in essence a good idea, it might also delete comments that do not actually contain HS or completely miss others overall. I think this decision by the newspaper turned into an entire discussion of manageability of monitoring discussion sections and away from the ethical considerations.

Considering a newspaper is a public platform, I believe everyone should try to be respective at all times. The comment space must not be removed, it helps to get insights of readers and is very helpful. I think the website should be enhanced in a way that it detects offensive language and doesn't allow the reader to continue if they use such.

Otherwise you are cutting short an experience that users might want to have. So by censoring all the comment section your make erverybody pay a price for something that they haven't done.

Having said that, perhaps the relevant question you should be asking is whether it is in their best interests to do so. That is, even if it's not their moral obligation, it may STILL be in their financial and functional best interest to do so. The prevalence and salience of hate speech may signal to audiences that the newspaper tolerates (at best) and endorses (at worst) the hateful commentary appearing in their comment section. How do you think this would impact the bottom-line of the bottom line of said newspaper company? I would argue: Not well. And how do you think this would impact the ability of said newspaper to reach future audiences? I would argue: Not well.

__label__Attack	The newspapers aren't reading consumer input though. The only people reading the comments section are other consumers. The only purpose they serve is announcing your views to everyone else reading the same article. It's unnecessary and people's opinions are rarely changed by what they read in the comments section from some random reader/commenter.	I was completely taken aback by some strong stances to remove the comment space, and the belief in that because Newspapers should be one-sided providers. I would disagree because newspaper share societal information and society should be allowed to engage and be part of the conversation instead of just consuming whatever information is being released for consumption. It has been seen as a result of other newspaper websites removing the comment section that it reduces the trust of the reader because they are aware of the bias of the information they are consuming, and also it reduces the amount of time readers spend on these sites because there is no community engagements.

__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it.

While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__noRel	I agree!	Maybe online newspapers can invest in text mining, where if hate speech is detected, the comment will not go through. Or, in the comments section, there could be a greyed message in the background that states a non-tolerance to hate speech.
__label__Support	I think the idea is marvellous, it will prevent pointless comments that are intended to hurt other readers or those mentioned in the articles.

Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	But what if the opinion of others infringes upon the rights of another. As much as we should all be able to express our opinion it shouldn't be at the expense of others.	I think comments give the ability to the users to express their opinion on what is described in the articles and this is an important rule for democracy. Removing the ability to comment in my view is basically limiting free speech. I also believe that user do not need necessarily to be identifiable, being anonymous is fine as long as they respect others and their opinions.

__label__noRel	I find it very helpful when the comments includes updates or links to a more current news story	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

__label__noRel	Yes, I think that readers can also downvote a comment or flag it so that it can be brought to the moderator's attention and they should take action within a specified time frame.	I believe the fairest way is the hardest way and that's to have a small group of people moderating REAL hate speech and spam. If someone wants to just use a racist term or promote their website, then these people's comment should be removed and they should be banned from commenting for a period of time. The idea to remove comments entirely is absurd as the news is not trustworthy enough to be the sole voice people hear. We need to hear other voices.

__label__noRel	How can we draw the fine line between hate speech and freedom of speech?	I think that keeping an open space for discussion is vital and needed. Strick and easy to understand rules should be there and a group of moderators implementing them as well. We should do more about educating on media ethics, keeping freedom of expression should be combined with counteracting hate speech messages.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	After doing some follow up reading from https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/what-is-online-hate-crime/ I have seen how the anonymity of these online comments can be what makes it so easy for people to be hateful. Therefore, an easy solution would be to make it impossible for people to comment anonymously, and have people have to provide personal information. However, I am not sure how this would work from a data protection point of view. It is certainly a start.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	Moderating comments is a far better method than eliminating comments entirely. I feel a method for reporting comments, though not perfect, is better, and then reported comments can be examined and removed if necessary.
__label__noRel	The same technology that allows social media to galvanise democratic activists can be used by hate groups seeking to organise and recruit. It also allows fringe sites, including peddlers of conspiracies, to reach audiences far broader than their core readership. Online platforms’ business models depend on maximising reading or viewing times. Since Facebook and similar platforms make their money by enabling advertisers to target audiences with extreme precision, it is in their interests to let people find the communities where they will spend the most time.https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons	The best way to reduce hate speech would be to make sure that moderators are present to check on comments, it would not be advisable to cancel comments completely due the feedback it gives and people will always have their opinions and sometimes they will involve hate speech, which is unavoidable...
__label__noRel	I like it but i worry it would just be ignored. Just removing a comment isn't much of a deterrent	Hate speech blocking will violate human rights to freedom of speech and cause people to feel opressed, as that would mean that they can not voice out their opinions.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	People tend to comment just to rile others up, which means it will be a lot of work to moderate. Perhaps an all or nothing approach is best.
__label__noRel	Also it's not about restricting any form of hate speech, we also need to be reminded that our opinions can't be the only right one. Hate speech is hate, and a crime against who ever is being undermined	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	"Opinions shouldn't be classed as ""hate speech"". If some people (snowflakes) get triggered by different points of view they should refrain from reading the comments section rather than whine about ""hate speech""."

I personally get very annoyed if I watch or read something and want to express my opinion, then go down to the comment section to sadly find out the comments are turned off. This limits the freedom of speech and blocks the ability for the people to vent out somehow. I think this builds aggression and causes problems afterwards. The better thing to do is to limit bad speech, foul words and cursing but removing the comments completely is not a good idea.

__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted.

Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.

Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.

__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	In addition to reducing hate speech by site moderation community moderation could also take place having the ability to flag a post for the attention of moderators which violates terms of service.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	I think one way to reduce hate speech online would be monitoring the message. If someone writes a message, it should be checked before allowing it to be posted, it could be done by a simple program where the computer looks for offensive words.
__label__noRel	However a view point can be expressed appropriately as a constructive criticism by the target audience. Therefore you could argue that anyone who engages in hate speech is the wrong audience.	Moderation is key. Plenty of newspapers and online media are able to keep comments open with a bit of moderation.

__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	block swearing, abusive, discrimatory words- freedom of speech without rasicism, name calling etc
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	Is it necessary to have readers comments? What do they add to the article?
__label__noRel	"Opinions shouldn't be classed as ""hate speech"". If some people (snowflakes) get triggered by different points of view they should refrain from reading the comments section rather than whine about ""hate speech""."	Hate speech is a form of self publicity. If the community isolates the perpetrators by flagging negative content that would be helpful. Flagged content would then need to be followed by banning perpetrators
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	Yes, public should also be able to express an opinion on a subject.	Asking people to identify themselves when doing their registration. If we remove the anonymous factor, people will be afraid to act like trolls.

__label__noRel	It may be a high-cost approach, but worthwhile for our modern society to prioritise for the good of a healthy, functioning nation.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	telemarketing can help companies reach a wider audience.	We should legalize prostitution
__label__Attack	yes, the lack of consequences is the problem. We can see from somewhere like facebook where peoples info is so easy to find that people have had negative consequences over their hateful posts so clearly being able to link back the comment to the person can help	Some people just like to spread their negative vibes on strangers, not worried about serious consequences, as the worst thing that can happen to them is the comment being removed. There should be consequences!
__label__Support	I agree with this comment there is no way to stop hate speaking but it can be done to draw a line and set up some limitations	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	I think my idea is good	you should autoban key hate speech words
__label__noRel	I don't think algorithm can accurately detect hate speech.	I agree with some other opinions on the use of A1 to flag or censor certain words that constitute hate or violent speech.

__label__noRel	missionary work in other countries can prove to be dangerous to the missionaries and their families.	We should ban factory farming

__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.

__label__noRel	I like this idea - there could also be a warning system for those reading the comments, if something does get published that possibly shouldn't have. A warning stating that the following comment may be offensive and contain hate speech.	There needs to be a moderator who is reviewing the comments that are made, I see a lot of inappropriate comments posted to news stories on the comments section of the news articles on facebook that incite arguments and hate speech. This is not acceptable and should not be allowed to happen.
__label__Support	It is our responsibility to stop cruelty against animals. Article 48 of the Indian constitution mentions that the state should take steps in prohibiting the slaughter of cattle.

__label__noRel	agree, the news could start selling fake information if the comment section would be removed	In my opinion the comment section should not be removed. I personally get very annoyed if I watch or read something and want to express my opinion, then go down to the comment section to sadly find out the comments are turned off. This limits the freedom of speech and blocks the ability for the people to vent out somehow. I think this builds aggression and causes problems afterwards. The better thing to do is to limit bad speech, foul words and cursing but removing the comments completely is not a good idea.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.

Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	I believe it is fair for hate speech comments to be censored, because it could lead to violent public behavior.

__label__noRel	Flags are strong symbology that get the point across more effectively then words, thus flag burning is a unique form of freedom of speech from letter writing or other forms of protest.	We should ban the use of child actors

__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	I think it'll be hard to do so, because everyone has the right to freedom of speech, but unless the comments brings acts of violence on people then it must be deleted

The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them.

If they post it, maybe a manual review can happen to determine if it was hate speech or not.

I have found that as well as reading the articles from newspapers, I have also been paying keen attention to the comments section of the article. Either on the newspaper site or on social media. I find that while the opinions of the article presens the views and research of the author, the comments offer an alternative viewpoint and opinions. A chance to see if the article hit the right note, and an opportunity to understand positives and negatives of a topic raised.
__label__Support	there are already plenty of unwanted children in the world and people should be encouraged to adopt instead.	Surrogacy should be banned
__label__noRel	Then who is the judge and jury to decide what is right and what is wrong?	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I think the comment space should be monitored by the newspaper for a more standard approach, because a lot of people have subjective views on what hate speech could be.	there needs to be some form of ceneorship of what newspaper can post i dont mean full censorship i just mean around things realating to hate of certain group
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	"I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that ""less restricted"" criteria should be?"	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	Yes, you can have your own opinion but that doesnt mean you have the right to spread hate.	Reduce the anonymity that hate-speech writers can hide behind - without that shield some may be less inclined to post because it can be traced back to them
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	Being open to the voice of the opposition means that we can hear another side of the argument	Our freedom to do anything as part of a society is limited. Thus freedom of speech should be no different. Poeple need to be held accountable for their mistakes, so everybody else's rights will be protected. So having a set of keywords which are not allowed to be used is a way of reminding the writter that using the offensive word he/she is trying to use is considered a crime. An additional way to handle that is having the flag option by users and a team of moderators who follow a standard and will verify if flagged comments should be maintained or not. Lastly, anonymity might bring a feeling of impunity and even its possibility, so a way to avoid that is allowing one profile per person/email, where a fake username can be set, but, in the backstage, the website will know who it is that wrote each comment.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	I think the best option would be to put some moderators that are educated about hateful speeches and let them see comments before they are online so that they can decide to approved them or not. They are doing it in Germany (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793)

__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	The disadvantage of having free speech it causes people to think it is Ok to bully, lie or name call other people and this causes more chaos and leads to more hate which is not the path that most newspaper websites want.	I understand that there will always be people saying the comment section needs to stay as we are all allowed free speech.
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Support	I agree	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	Why can't Arab countries shelter refugees from other Arab countries? Same habits, religion and they have enough wealth.	We should reintroduce nuclear power in Germany
__label__noRel	I disagree. I think other readers of hate speech could be influenced by it making the issue spread even further.

__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	In today's world where technology has advanced to such a degree, I'm of the belief that creating parameters that protect individuals from any form of hate speech is very much possible through things such as AI. The removing of commenting sections could be argued as a violation to one's freedom of speech, it also means the views and opinions of the public will be lost which could have detrimental effects.
__label__Support	Definitely, it can be very polarising in itself with a definition and cause more issue if the wrong thing is removed	What is characterised as hate speech needs to be assessed on a case by case basis. It is not absolute
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	If facts are given sources should be used to back this up.	I think that the introduction of moderators to remove any hate speech would be beneficial. Perhaps the introduction of guidelines as to what constitutes permitted negative comments.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	This is not a black or white topic. The question is how exactly we define hate speech. Criticism in itself is not hate speech, but it is easy to take things to extremes, especially when someone expresses their opinion anonymously. Education about the reasons is important to better understand our own feelings and behaviour. Educate people do not restrict them!
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	I actually agree that eliminating the space for conversation on polarizing topics can reduce extremist echo chambers sometimes. Though they often move to other platforms that have zero regulations to hold that conversation when they can't have it where they saw something. Which increases the odds of being stuck in a hateful echo chamber.	People will always spew hate speech and regulating it may be difficult to do. Freedom of speech should prevail therefore eliminating the comments section would be wrong. The newspaper site may have an automation that identifies hate words and whenever these appear the comment should be hidden from the comments section.
__label__noRel	I strongly agree with your opinion, however the reader comments need to be respect as a platform despite people having the right to freedom of speech.	The comment section needs to be moderated using some kind of filter to automatically filter any words on the banned list and then use a report system to flag up anything which tries to bypass this. This will allow a human moderator to quickly decide what can be kept and what needs action.
__label__noRel	this can work if they have a filtering system to filter out the the hate speech comments	We can remove it fairly by making rules and monitoring the comment section.
__label__Support	I agree	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Attack	if a person can't afford otherwise, sure, give them a public defender but to require them is insanity. the cost is just too great.	The use of public defenders should be mandatory
__label__noRel	I think the autor should have some saying if she/he likes the comment.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	Don't think we should be censoring people	Reducing hate speech shouldn't be the focus. The problem lies in the reactions to it - in particular, giving the drastic perspectives too much attention. This attention only encourages more of the debate and problematic perspectives. Though total ignorance would also be unfair, so really we need a position of just LESS attention and care given to such perspectives.
__label__noRel	The European Union is doing amazingly well in relation to the enormous bad publicity it is receiving from all sides.

We need a Europe that respects life from conception is a humane Europe
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	I don't think we can police websites 100% but if comments are moderated I think we can reach quite a high degree of compliance
__label__Attack	that requires people who play by the rules	I don't believe removing the comment section will help remove hate speech, but having a system that can track the device and the people that use that device can go a long way in removing trolls from a community platform and prevent them from becoming repeat offenders.

Freedom of speech is definitely curtailed if people who are likely to be attacked are themselves, afraid to speak. The experience of CreepyPMs in keeping their site open, friendly and inclusive, using 30 moderators for a relatively small site and a tough policy where in essence that comments must be conductive to a supportive environment and if not, can be removed, even if they have not violated a specific rule, seems to potentially curtail freedom of speech and could silence valid criticism but can also ""allow marginalised and targeted individuals who are not likely to share their stories or opinions when the door is left open to the rest of the world"" to speak. https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation"	I think that hate speech should be reduced through widescale education about the origins, hurts and trauma behind words which are used.

The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.

__label__noRel	agree. It is also well documented that it can be harmful. A modern legal test of the legitimacy of proposed restrictions on freedom of speech was stated in the opinion by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. in Schenk v. U.S. (1919): a restriction is legitimate only if the speech in question poses a “clear and present danger”—i.e., a risk or threat to safety or to other public interests that is serious and imminent.	Reduce hate speech by screening out certain words. If a comment contains such words, it is deleted or hidden from public view
__label__noRel	yes. good moderators are the key	"Freedom of Speech'...that's a popular consensus among the masses, regardless of the casualities"" that are left on the wayside. Having reread a lot of the comments posted here, I do consider the possibility of having people comment as they wish, politically correct or not. HOWEVER, let there be consequences involved, such as naming and shaming, and acquring user details if need be, after all, things such as cyber crime, online harrassment, etc do exist, am I right? And so, if such a comment borders on this, let it become a criminal matter and have law enforcement dealing specifically in cyber-related crimes become involved. Problem solved."
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Although it would be fair to allow for both critical and positive input, I believe that newspaper websites should have a mechanism in place that can identify hate speech and restrict individuals who use it. This would prevent readers from freely using hate speech.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way.

__label__Support	I completely agree, the internet already needed policies to stop hate speech or insults.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	Newspaper websites can have an option where other people could report the hate speech comment.
__label__Support	I totally disagree with this, If the newspaper is not the place for comments then where would they get the platform to voice out their convictions	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	I think this is a good idea, but people have a way of getting around these filters by using different fonts or characters that cannot be read by the filter bots.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	I agree with this idea. It feels like the easiest one to apply or at least to start with. From what I know, there are no algorithms applying this on newspapers, so it would still be a starting point against hatred and aggressive behaviours.	To ensure freedom of speech is still maintained, moderation needs to be carried out fairly. To achieve this, we need to understand what is hate speech and what are the lines that seperate that with constructive criticism.

Removing the comment section all together is a fair point as news is meant to be fair and impartial. People share their opinions based on their biases and that's not what the news is for - that's what social media is for. But in this case allowing the comment section to remain would be great if people would not abuse the power to share freely by sharing hate speech and slander. us as humans need to be regulated by a set of rules in order to keep a functioning society and i think a filtered comment section is the solution.

__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.

__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	The difficulty with reducing hate speech, is that it is everywhere. It cannot feasibly be reduced with human power, but rather requires a computer system. The difficulty with an electronic system, is that it inherently requires money and financing, and therefore is incentivised to make money. When money is in the equation; thoughts, politics and ideas can be easily manipulated by those funding the system
__label__noRel	I believe that punishment would cause more polarization because people may have more negative feelings towards newspaper websites with comments sections. Like what AllisonK said, education is a better preventative measure. If punishment is necessary, it should involve education that the commentator actively engages in.	Freedom of speech can be used as catch-all term to justify the use and propagation of bigoted and hateful language. If we accept that some language is not acceptable due to it's clearly hateful nature then we have to acknowledge that some form of censorship of those particular instances has to occur. I would suggest that eliminating all such spaces from newspaper websites would have a massive detrimental effect on valid, non-bigoted, freedom of speech a cornerstone of western life. We don't ban all cars because some people speed dangerously, we monitor the roads and ban the bad drivers. I suggest that as long as readers comments are monitored continually they should remain.

__label__Attack	Social media platforms are far from perfect at dealing with hate speech, it may even be detrimental because it would allow a lot more people to comment and therefore a lot more hate could potentially be displayed	One cost-effective way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites while promoting reader comments is to outsource reader comments to social media. Comment sections can show comments for the article from social media platforms, while encouraging users to post comments onto these platforms. This way, hate speech can be reduced by social media platforms, which are more experienced with content moderation, have extensive rules in place, and have economies of scale with regard to content moderation compared to newspapers.

__label__noRel	"Your post contains the argument, ""Newspapers should cancel comment space because it can create... fake news."" I don't think this is particularly convincing. By that logic, newspapers and news websites themselves should be cancelled since they will periodically create ""fake news"" - sometimes not due to malice but rather by an honest mistake [or journalist incompetence/ignorance]. Ben Goldacre, for example, runs (ran?) a blog called, ""Bad Science"" and a recurring motif was journalists failing to accurately depict scientific insights. We could argue that their exagerrations and mistranslations could be construed as ""fake news"" but there's no malice involved. The journalists weren't trying to deceive anyone. The solution to getting closer to an approximation of truth is not to remove an entire avenue of communication, but rather to open up (regulated) communication in the hopes that the arguments that are most cogent rises above the rest - and that the logical wheat be separated from the illogical chaff. That is to say, I think we need a better system than just, ""let's get rid of the comment section."" It's a tricky problem, no doubt, and a perfect solution may not exist. But we should not let ""perfect"" get in the way of, ""good enough."" In a subsequent post, I detail ONE possible method that incorporates several solutions previously mentioned (and as I write this post, I thought of ways to improve it further.

Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	we can reduce hate speech by blocking out certain words so that it can not be viewed publicly. and blocking the user using hate speech
__label__noRel	First, we should empower people more: put an emphasis on education and build a control mechanism for internet propaganda, e.g. force transparency on which content is truly human and which is sponsored or created by organizations and companies. Second, we should criminalize deliberate misinformation properly. Third, we should restructure the representation of people in the European Union. After all the above-mentioned, we can think about establishing a more binding role of petitions to the European Parliament.	There should be more unity and cooperation in Europe.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	we live in a modern world where men and women should have the same opportunities. many sexists words like anchorman for example give the impression that jobs are only for certain sexes.	We should subsidize embryonic stem cell research
__label__noRel	I agree on the usefulness of a report button.	I think you can put a price to the website- a subscription to readers.
__label__Support	Refugees are here to seek protection and rapid repatriation when it is no longer necessary is a matter of course. When it comes to crimes, people are simply no longer worthy of protection and cannot be expelled because their actions show us that they neither accept nor respect our rules.	We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers and migrants
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	Newspapers should have an algorithm that catches certain words or phrases which are hateful in nature. These words will be automatically flagged up and accounts that are flagged x amount of times should then be restricted from commenting for a period of time. If after this period, they continue to try and post comments with hateful content, they should be banned entirely from commenting.
__label__noRel	The EU needs a robust Frontex Agency with the caveat that Frontex missions must report to the member states on whose territories they operate.	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Hate speech is complex and jubjective. AI is still developing and not good enough to understand basic debate let alone interpret language, Too easy for AI to take words out of context.	There should be repercussions to extensive hate speech e.g a limited ban to the forum etc. Use moderators and ensure that users understand the consequences of hate speech commente
__label__Support	Policy makers have vested interests with industry to ignore signals of overshoot and straining risks. Whatever action will be taken too late and there is no way to prevent feedback loops	Climate change is accelerating - due to feedback loops- much faster that what humanity can -or is willing to- decelerate it. Unfortunately is not feasible with current technology
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	if you want to save birds, you perhaps should think about domesticated cats and making modern buildings more bird-friendly. If you want to save insects, look at the way of land use and agriculture, and create insect-friendly gardens.	We should forbid authorities to give tax advantages, or any kind of incentives, to companies providing expensive and powerful company cars to their employees
__label__noRel	collectivism brings people together	We should prohibit school prayer
__label__noRel	homeopathy is sometimes used by people instead of traditional medicine. this could lead to unnecessary deaths.	We should legalize sex selection
__label__Support	homeopathy has no scientific evidence of efficacy and is equivalent to simply taking no medical action at all.	Homeopathy brings more harm than good
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	It allows racist views to be challenged	Nowadays with the amount of social media platforms that are available newspapers don't hold as much power. We get all of our news through the spreading of news in social media as seen in this article : https://kettlemag.co.uk/social-media-versus-print-media/
__label__noRel	The human rights regulations should be adapted. They were written half a century ago when we did not have mass migration.	We should invest in nuclear energy
__label__Support	Diversity helps decisions to be more informed and effective. Ensuring everybody's voices are heard helps to meet the needs of all members of the community.	Diversity is important so that all sides are heard
__label__noRel	The EU is established on treaties, but treaties have no soul. Only a constitution has a soul, provided it is well designed: from, by, and for the people.	The EU needs a European research center
__label__Support	This is a measured, moderate response which looks to preserve the best of both worlds.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	Foster care children may have many adverse outcomes that persist throughout childhood, such as poor peer relationships, behavioral problems, or other mental health difficulties	Foster care brings more harm than good
__label__noRel	Only together and with Frontex we ensure the management of EU borders. Migrants from Africa and Asia will arrive in increasing numbers in the coming years.	We need an inclusive and pluralistic European society
__label__noRel	Changes in management practices, and above all the integration of trees in arable and pastoral lands, are key, and could turn agriculture from a net emitter to a net absorber of greenhouse gases.	Everyone should have equal access to affordable and high-quality public services, including health
__label__noRel	Algorithms are not always accurate	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	people should be free to believe what they want to believe about it.	Holocaust denial should be a criminal offence
__label__noRel	"I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that ""less restricted"" criteria should be?"	Hate speech is subjective and as such should not be censored.
__label__noRel	Regulation of the comment section will definitely help reduce the hate speech	Removing the comment section will not be effective since there will not be any interactions between readers.
__label__noRel	payday loans have really high interest rates only because of how risky it is to loan money to certain individuals.	We should adopt an austerity regime
__label__noRel	comments on every platform can become a breeding ground for hate. It becomes a place for people to vent and voice their hateful comments, it can also lead to bullying and other negative aspects of online life. Comments should be banned unless heavily moderated.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	If opinions are given it should be clear they are opinions and not facts.	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	it's not proven that it actually works and might cause people who have problems to get worse.	We should ban cosmetic surgery
__label__noRel	This may end up filtering out individuals with valid opinions that just feel safer commenting anonymously.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I agree with you, online privacy is already a massive issue, I don't want to have to submit even more personal data (that could end up sold to advertisers) just to comment on an article. I also don't think 'tracking down' people who post hate speech online is practical or achievable.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	I agree, it's important to make sure that the way we design filtering criteria is not another centralized mechanism which undermines fairness.	when we talk about filtering the critical aspect that usually arise is the fact what would be the criteria who gonna decide what is hate speech and what is canceling people's right to speak
__label__Attack	is achievable	there must be a way to build in logarithms to find certain words or phrases
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	many parents aren't educated well enough to teach their children.	Homeschooling should be banned
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	I believe removing the comment section is not a solution and that it actually encourages hate speech
__label__noRel	people can share creative ideas and hateful words and ideas are not used	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	This seems like agreat idea.	comments should be allowed on newspaper articles so that people can have a discussion and express their opinions, regulation would ultimately ensure that everything is kept in order.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	vocational education doesn't need to be subsidized. it's an option and is up to the person to choose it and subsequently pay for it as well.	We should subsidize vocational education
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others.

__label__Attack	foster care is a great thing that enables children to have a family when theirs is not able to take care of them.	Foster care brings more harm than good
__label__Attack	we should not abandon television because it gives us a lot of news and information that may not otherwise be available to us	We should abandon television
__label__noRel	We must support countries that want to improve the welfare and rights of their citizens. If a country wants to join the EU and meets the conditions for joining, the decision to join is solely between the candidate country and the EU.	Wind and solar energy resources do more harm than good
__label__noRel	I agree with that. We shouldn't incentive hate speech.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Attack	Moderation can be timely and expensive and then you wouldn't see comments in real time	I think that someone should be assigned as a moderator who assesses comments before they are posted to ensure they don't contain any offensive information
__label__noRel	we should abandon television because it can cause a screen addiction	Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence
__label__noRel	We should try and make the internet a more welcoming place.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated.

__label__Support	surrogacy can be dangerous for the surrogate, and can create an emotional bond between birth mother and child that makes it very difficult for the birth mother to surrender the child to the surrogate couple	Surrogacy should be banned
__label__noRel	Everyone has the right to be wrong sometimes. Everyone (immigrants and Europeans) should behave well, but I think it depends a lot on the level of inclusion of these people. If we manage to be a welcoming continent, the people who come will thank us by being part of society.	The EU should play a major role in a multipolar world
__label__noRel	I agree, it is just what I said.	Hate speech is an attack, a threat, or prehudice speech.
__label__Attack	free thinking for all should never be a crime.	Holocaust denial should be a criminal offence
__label__Support	A psychological examination should be part of child screening, together with counseling to parents (e.g. dealing with children’s own concerns and fears, or increasing self-confidence among children and parents). It would also make it easier to protect children from violence, for example by overwhelming them, or to recognize them in the home and learn from the outset how to take care of their mental health.	We should promote mental health
__label__noRel	The EU needs a robust Frontex Agency with the caveat that Frontex missions must report to the member states on whose territories they operate.	Public transport in EU cities should be free
__label__Attack	yes, I agree, need moderators,	The best way to reduce hate speech would be to make sure that moderators are present to check on comments, it would not be advisable to cancel comments completely due the feedback it gives and people will always have their opinions and sometimes they will involve hate speech, which is unavoidable...
__label__Support	television rots peoples brains so should be abandoned.	We should abandon television
__label__noRel	I agree with Dominic , who becomes judge of what is true, what is without bias, what is hateful versus what is simply disagree, disapprove, dislike. Do we say happy things only and simply create artifical safe spaces where only positive ego boosting comments are allowed?	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them.

__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	Addressing hate speech should not mean prohibiting freedom of speech which is what you will be doing if the comments' section is removed. Instead a way to reduce the hate speech from escalating into something dangerous must be sourced and implemented. https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/UN%20Strategy%20and%20Plan%20of%20Action%20on%20Hate%20Speech%2018%20June%20SYNOPSIS.pdf
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	regardless of the nuance in hate speech, a platform can still manage it effectively using the laid out definitions but also can fill some of the gap by having a wider language policy that also includes the use of threatening and aggressive language	The problem with moderating means that people may have a stance on what counts as a hate comment and may cause differing opinions and deletions of stuff that may just be outside someone's comfort zone https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	by giving guide lines on the comment section
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	One way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for reader comments would to have active community managers who are activetly managing the comment section. Making sure that all comments are in accordance to the community guidelines.
__label__noRel	They can be made visible	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.

__label__Attack	Asking people to ignore it is not a solution	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	I agree , however strong moderation to the comments very quickly could work.	"The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is often used as a reason not to have readers comments. It seems that this is not a fair argument for eliminating readers comments because of the psychological phenomenon of ""cognitive dissonance"" - we automatically search for echo chambers in any context."
__label__noRel	What you are suggesting means that free speech should be limited to those articles that won't generate a conversation. If you look at https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/10/news-sites-that-turn-off-commenting-dont-drive-users-to-social-media-instead/ it shows that restricting or reducing comments can inflame a situation and cause irrational and trolling.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	No Federations, no centralization. We need to respect the European diversity.	We should ban live-bait fishing within the EU
__label__Support	entrapment should be legal because it catches criminals that were already looking to commit the crime anyway.	Entrapment should be legalized
__label__noRel	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button	I think this is a task that is hard to do because it has to be done in a way that would not hinder freedom of speech but at the same time not attack people. Thus, I think comments should be flagged depending on the words used but not be deleted until it has been checked.
__label__noRel	I agree	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.

__label__noRel	I agree with your idea. But it is a long and arduous way to reach the goal. What's the point of building a skyscraper without a foundation? What I mean by that: First the EU needs a unified foreign policy and only then a common and united army.	We should reduce animal farming.
__label__noRel	"I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that ""less restricted"" criteria should be?"	I agree with most of the commenters here, there needs to be moderation. Even if you don't agree with the arguments there are ways of saying it that do not fall into 'hate speech'.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	Organizing, promoting, directing and financing mass migration is a crime against humanity.	We should stop mass migration.
__label__noRel	That is the problem not everyone thinks that they saying something hateful until someone mentions it.	What about allowing the comment section, but having a built-in screener running in the background, that automatically prevents posts with certain hateful words it is built to detect?
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	by giving guide lines on the comment section
__label__noRel	It's true that this would eliminate hate speech	Debate should be available upon all topics. To reduce this availability reduces the opportunities for people to express their opinions and undermines democratic processes. Hate speech should be managed and eliminated before publication.

__label__noRel	What are the root causes?	There needs to be a moderator who is reviewing the comments that are made, I see a lot of inappropriate comments posted to news stories on the comments section of the news articles on facebook that incite arguments and hate speech. This is not acceptable and should not be allowed to happen.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	There could be a segment in the website that gives informed context to a subject to prevent uninformed comments and furthermore the newspaper should monitor the comments and censor any hate speech comments.
__label__noRel	I leave a link to the study: https://mediaengagement.org/research/journalists-and-online-comments/	people must change, not internet/website

__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	I think people should be encouraged to give personal comments however they need to be monitored to ensure hate speech cannot be seen which might negatively impact others
__label__Attack	The age of 18 years is considered a legal adult in India. They have voting rights too. But not giving them the right to marry the partner of their choice may work against their rights. In 2018, the Law Commission recommended lowering the minimum legal age of men from 21 to 18 years and suggested keeping both genders’ minimum legal age for marriage as 18 years.	Indian government should increase the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	Although it might be unfair for others, I think majority can agree that removing the comment section will be helpful because then it means anyone that has an opinion can rather call the newspaper.
__label__noRel	Economic interests should never be at the expense of social and environmental policy. It is of utmost importance that the protection of workers’ rights and the rules we agreed upon with the Paris Agreement on climate change are at the heart of trade and investment policy. As the EU belongs to the global market, we must guarantee decent jobs that are sustainable, as well as collective, independent representation of workers in trade unions.	We should create an EU protocol for UAP reports of personnel employed by airlines and personnel of all armed forces for all member states
__label__noRel	The idea of using AI algorithms to combat hate speech is an attractive one. However, using experience of Facebook, it's clear that AI systems are still not advanced enough to undertake this task without human oversight. Facebook often censors posts or comments unfairly because its AI algorithms doesn't understand the context. In short, I don't believe we can get away without using humans to check the flagged comments at least.	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	I agree that hate speech can never be completely eliminated	It is important that people are able to have a voice, especially as it can be a great tool in educating people, and giving people a variety of viewpoints that they wouldn't necessarily get to often hear. Sometimes we learn best by hearing and understanding the views of other people. We don't have to necessarily change our opinions, but it can help us become more aware of why or how people feel a certain way about things.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	Comment space encourages discussion of important topics and allows free exchange of information and so should not be eliminated. Independent moderators should be used in order to ensure that hate speech is quickly deleted and encourage users to express their ideas without using inappropriate or aggressive language.
__label__noRel	I agree as many news papers in our days don't have comment sections as it is expensive and time consuming	Freedom of speech can be used as catch-all term to justify the use and propagation of bigoted and hateful language. If we accept that some language is not acceptable due to it's clearly hateful nature then we have to acknowledge that some form of censorship of those particular instances has to occur. I would suggest that eliminating all such spaces from newspaper websites would have a massive detrimental effect on valid, non-bigoted, freedom of speech a cornerstone of western life. We don't ban all cars because some people speed dangerously, we monitor the roads and ban the bad drivers. I suggest that as long as readers comments are monitored continually they should remain.
__label__Attack	I agree with this, as it creates a more safe space for everyone	By implimenting a system that can filter out all comments before the comments are added to the website or newspaper for the readers to read
__label__noRel	I agree that anybody being allowed to comment can give rise to fake news in comment sections	No-one should have to spend their time filtering out the disgusting things human beings are capable of saying about each other. Nobody has a right to comment on anything.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.

Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea.

__label__noRel	Not so much swearing and negativity.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	I have to disagree with this, as giving an opinion that is opposite to the other person's opinion is completely different that using hate speech to deliver the message. You can have free speech and hate speech banning at the same time working together. Using AI to spot hatespeech keywords, while still allowing people to argue and have different opinions, as long as they aren't doing it the wrong way.	1. Only allow verified accounts to post - these accounts should be easily traced back to individuals. 2. Moderate comments with both algorithms and human visibility. 3. Prosecute.

__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	After doing some follow up reading from https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/what-is-online-hate-crime/ I have seen how the anonymity of these online comments can be what makes it so easy for people to be hateful. Therefore, an easy solution would be to make it impossible for people to comment anonymously, and have people have to provide personal information. However, I am not sure how this would work from a data protection point of view. It is certainly a start.
__label__Attack	Democracy dies in darkness. Commentary on news was made to spark debate and deeper thought about new events. I feel something is lost if we remove this feature from news articles.

__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	This article below focuses on the negative views of the comment section. I like the quote from Dr Philips, as she explains that more discussion is required, not less, and thus an onsite intervention is required to deal with hate speech as opposed to the removal of the comment section. https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation
__label__noRel	the problem is that people are not happy and that has a reason	Removing the comment section from online newspapers is not the answer. Allowing people to post their opinions is healthy and a normal part of human society- people will not always agree. However, in order to reduce hate speech, which can so often lead to crime, it could be done so that there are monitors (either human or computer) who check comments before they are posted to ensure they are not hate speech.
__label__noRel	I think adding chat bans for repeat offenders of hate speech could help.	I think using a platform which blocks out certain words, kind of like a filter would help. So if someone made a post with a certain word in, that post would not be made public, instead the comment would be flagged and go to a admin, who can read the comment and then decide if the 'bot' which flagged it was correct or not, and then deciding if to allow the post to be made or not
__label__Support	Thats why its best to have set rules. Like swear language, certain words, threats and stuff like that but anything that is just opinion should be allowed no matter if you disagree or don't like what is said.

__label__Support	We need single and selective migration rules. It is very challenging for Europe to protect its border without harming refugees or financial migrants fleeing their countries, and it cannot be efficient without unified and powerful border security (Frontex).	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non first-world countries
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	I was completely taken aback by some strong stances to remove the comment space, and the belief in that because Newspapers should be one-sided providers. I would disagree because newspaper share societal information and society should be allowed to engage and be part of the conversation instead of just consuming whatever information is being released for consumption. It has been seen as a result of other newspaper websites removing the comment section that it reduces the trust of the reader because they are aware of the bias of the information they are consuming, and also it reduces the amount of time readers spend on these sites because there is no community engagements.

__label__noRel	Disagree! people should be abl eto express themselves in a respectful manner.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	I agree with you but there would have to be a lot of work put into the filters as people do get around them and still are able to make their hateful points using text speak or misspelling ever so slightly. This is just something that would have to be considered.	"In as much as we can not let the spread of hate speech continue, closing the comment section is not the solution. The newspaper website should have the option for readers to be able to report comments that include hate speech and moderators should be appointed to check ""users"" that are violating the rules. There can be filters in place that remove posts that have some of the common hateful and derogatory phrases. outlining the rules and regulations for the website users can help"
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	"The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is often used as a reason not to have readers comments. It seems that this is not a fair argument for eliminating readers comments because of the psychological phenomenon of ""cognitive dissonance"" - we automatically search for echo chambers in any context."
__label__noRel	yes this is the best way to reduce hate speech while still allowing readers to comment their opinion	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Attack	Requiring people to give a lot of information about themselves in order to give their opinion online is NOT a direction we should be going in. Moderators are fine; requiring people to dox themselves so they can be educated is not it.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	Reduces the amount of troll comments	We need to create a society where we can debate with each other respectfully, we can know which platforms to use and not rile each other up without offending. It is widely suggested that education can address the extent of hate speech: https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/addressing-hate-speech-through-education-global-education-ministers-conference. However, this needs to go hand in hand with moderation of sites to ensure people are kept within reason. It is not a case of any one single solution.
__label__Attack	Hate speech is some fairly clear definitions, particularly around race and gender [https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech], so it really shouldn't be hard to identify clearly offensive comments directed at a person or group of persons, over valid criticism. The only danger is if the moderator is also biased and does not like an opinion, but in these cases, an independent review will clearly show an abuse of moderator power.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	By opening a comment section and allowing anyone to express themselves there, holding the newspaper's website accountable for someone's comment seems a bit too much.	by giving guide lines on the comment section
__label__noRel	newspapers are owned and have people to answer to financially, they are also driven by clicks and advertising revenue so you could be blinded without understanding feedback on a topic from the public	By having stricter controls over who can sign up to the comments and blocking them from the sites when they use hate speech. It's unfortunate that it happens, but sometimes they are loud just to get attention. Starve them of it.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

I think it should be a group of people rather than AI to do this to ensure all hate speech within a variety of contexts are eliminated, as if this was done by a computer there is risk of hate spilling through. For example, hate speech on the social media platform Twitter can often be missed as users purposefully misspell hateful speech to ensure it does not flag up on the AI searches, going as far as hateful language misspelt actually trending on Twitter.

Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.

__label__Attack	The fact is that the knowledge on climate change is still very limited. Assumptions that we make about the damage today could be disproved tomorrow.

With advancements in technology there is little reason to believe we can't reverse some of these things.	Some damage towards the climate is currently irreversible to prevent reversal in time.

__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.

__label__noRel	I absolutely agree with this. As we've seen recently (https://medium.com/dfrlab/alt-right-and-alt-social-media-4fa23eb2fbd1) cracking down on the more ofensive comments on one website can lead to groups of people finding a more lenient place and bunching up there, creating a vicious cycle where they push each other to be more and more extreme. It's true that we should monitor the comment section, but overdoing it could lead to worse results somewhere else.	Many people are against the reducing of hate speech from newspaper article, and I am with them on this. The main reason for putting comment section on newspaper websites was for readers to leave a comment, people will always have something to say whether it is good or bad. But AI can still be used to remove comments that can be severely harmful.

__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	If the aim is merely to reduce hate speech then I think eradicating the comment section goes too far. Why should people not be allowed to comment and have their say.

Removing the comment facility in no way infringes free speech. The content providers, newspapers, are at liberty to provide discussion space or not as they see fit. The use of a moderator might be useful but this seems a great investment of time to little effect.

__label__Attack	Right to free speech isn't necessarily a right to a platform or a publisher. Before the internet, people weren't entitled to have their comments on the news stapled inside a copy of the paper. They were just able to express their opinions on it independently, to family or coworkers, or by writing their own publication in response. I'm not sure if newspapers simply choosing not to publish readers' comments (which is what they are doing by hosting those comments on their site) is the same as censoring free speech. By this logic, anyone who writes a poorly written opinion piece and submits it to the New York Times should get it published, because otherwise their speech is oppressed.

__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted.

__label__Support	I agree that we, as humans, can adapt to the situation as best as possible. But we can also take small steps towards change. The situation doesn't have to be impossible.

__label__noRel	But then public opinion would be silenced.	I tend to agree that newspapers should provide spaces for dicussion. It encourages people to read about the topic before making comments and peopel can easily reference reference the article in their comments. I think this allows for a more fruitful and productive discussion that on other platforms e.g. social media. However, hate speech is certainly an issue and easily derails conversations. While moderation of hate speech would be ideal, the burden on the newspaper is likely too great to do this manually. Perhaps a mixture of auto-moderation (flagging/removing key words), manual review by the newspaper and some form of community moderation may work well together.

__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	I believe the fairest way is the hardest way and that's to have a small group of people moderating REAL hate speech and spam. If someone wants to just use a racist term or promote their website, then these people's comment should be removed and they should be banned from commenting for a period of time. The idea to remove comments entirely is absurd as the news is not trustworthy enough to be the sole voice people hear. We need to hear other voices.
__label__noRel	AI is a great option that would reduce the need for manpower and increase the efficiency and speed in which hate speech is addressed.	Newspaper comment spaces allow people the opportunity to share their opinions and feel that they can contribute their thoughts and ideas - it can also help readers engage with the content in a different way.
__label__noRel	I agree	Be more strict when allowing people to create profiles, that require identification before allowing anybody to comment. Stopping people being anonymous enough to feel confident while posting hate speech I think will be more beneficial than restricting peoples comments.

__label__noRel	I think this already happens on some sites (flagging offensive comments) and is a good way of ensuring any comments which may offend someone, can be moderated and removed if necessary.

Hate speech is a problem but we do need to have debate. We need to respect different views and allow people to voice their opinion where necessary to further a debate on a news topic.

The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others.

__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	Our freedom to do anything as part of a society is limited. Thus freedom of speech should be no different. Poeple need to be held accountable for their mistakes, so everybody else's rights will be protected. So having a set of keywords which are not allowed to be used is a way of reminding the writter that using the offensive word he/she is trying to use is considered a crime. An additional way to handle that is having the flag option by users and a team of moderators who follow a standard and will verify if flagged comments should be maintained or not. Lastly, anonymity might bring a feeling of impunity and even its possibility, so a way to avoid that is allowing one profile per person/email, where a fake username can be set, but, in the backstage, the website will know who it is that wrote each comment.

Firstly this is unfair to all the people who want to have their say and should be able to do so Dominicis wrong
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	I think that the warning system is a good route, as the AI might eliminate valid arguments and miss hate speech accidentally. A warning system would still need an AI, but it warns users that their comment may be hate speech and if it is, the user can rethink their wording or risk posting it. If they post it, maybe a manual review can happen to determine if it was hate speech or not.
__label__noRel	I think using AI would not prove to be very effective. If this AI was to be self-supervised (without any moderators) I think it would quickly start flagging not-hateful comments as hate speech since it's very susceptible to user input - see what happened to Microsoft's Twitter bot Tay. After a couple of weeks, if I'm not mistaken, the AI started posting very hateful tweets about the holocaust and minorities.	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	There should be people assigned to go over the comments provided in order to ensure that the final approved posts do not contain hate speech.

I'd much rather that people saw what other people thought and were able to consider it. Hopefully, readers will recognise when some people are irrational and will not add fuel to the fire.

There will always be a few bad apples in a batch just as there will always be bad people among humanity. Honestly the easiest method of combatting this issue is through the utilization of manual review teams perhaps hired by the newspaper or even paid through revenue made by the articles failing that approach bots can be instantiated with the programmed capability of removing comments that have flagged contents inside them.

__label__Support	"I agree. Some for of moderation is needed. Users should have to agree to some sort of ""anti hate speech"" policy when signing up and accounts who violate the policy (by posting hate speech) should be banned.

With rights comes responsibility. We all have freedom of speech but it is our responsibility to ensure that our speech does not cause harm on others.

Removing the comment section from online newspapers is not the answer. Allowing people to post their opinions is healthy and a normal part of human society- people will not always agree. However, in order to reduce hate speech, which can so often lead to crime, it could be done so that there are monitors (either human or computer) who check comments before they are posted to ensure they are not hate speech.

We use guidelines for everything including media regulations for accurate reporting or having to retract when information is not accurate. It's no different in the comments section, it doesn't remove free speech it regulates it to create a healthy environment to have a conversation in. Over moderation can have as severe of an effect as under, it has to be a system that takes in common complaints from both sides. Not the hate speech side per say but the sides of people who are pro free flowing conversation and those who want more shielding to avoid extremist echo chambers.

__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	At the end of the day hate speech is not hate speech to everyone, I ended up reaching the conclusion that everyone has their own opinion about everything, So to want to filter or block comments is not freedom of speech, but building a sensitive society that is scared of debates and confronting serious issues, Its up to the receiver of the comment to act on it or not. Cyber bullying is a different story.
__label__Attack	There could be a risk with this. In an article from 2016 (https://www.jstor.org/stable/44014621) Flaxman et al. make the following point in their abstract: 'the vast majority of online news consumption is accounted for by individuals simply visiting the home pages of their favorite, typically mainstream, news outlets'. If this is the case, it's possible that the 'diverse' opinions will be in a cycle of one sided shared opinions, and few 'other' or opposed opinions. These could well end up being quite extreme, and the policy to include other opinions could well serve the opposite function of promoting hate speech when it is a massive minority.....maybe.	Control what is printed or posted to make sure that it is diverse and does not contain any hate speech but the message they are trying to get across they are able to. That way newspaper can leave the comment section and different opinions are heard and expressed and no one gets hurt.

__label__noRel	I have to agree with DamianC above, I notice a lot of hate speech on twitter for example and I feel this would if anything create more problems as they would have zero control over the platform.	The way to fairly reduce hate speech is to use a mix of technology and human intervention to manage the potential volume of moderation required to provide a healthy environment for discussion. There are a number of tools available that allow for pre- and post-moderation to curb the worst excesses of user comments.

The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them.

I would not eliminate the hate speech right away but rather alarm the user and ask them to refrain from that kind of speech or ask them to elaborate or explain the reasons for the anger. Maybe as a moderator I would try to understand their viewpoint because by removing the speech there will be just more anger and hatred.
__label__Attack	We can always try to reduce it. It's important to let people with good intentions comment and protect them against hate speech commets, than can do a lot of harm https://www.coe.int/en/web/cyberviolence/online-hate-speech-and-hate-crime	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	social media is a great platform to connect and socialize with friends and family.it has become a substitute for newspaper and is very reliable.	Social media brings more harm than good
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	Absolutely true. Everyone has freedom of speech. We live in a democratic country where everyone have the right to speak and all voices need to be heard. It is up to the individual to make sure that they put forward their points without being too aggressive and not getting carried away.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	I think my idea is good	I think we can do this by having comments sufficiently moderated and removed if needed if they are producing hate speech.
__label__noRel	"I feel newspapers don't work well and an interactive medium anyway. ""letters to the editor"" might be an avenue"	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I also agree with this. This solution is a middle ground between two extremes.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.

__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	By a combination of monitoring and blocking people who leave such comments, and also having suitable laws in place to back this up
__label__Attack	intelligence tests are there to recognize kids who are smarter and to be given proper chance.	Intelligence tests bring more harm than good

__label__Attack	because the state pays for public defenders they have a smaller budget, meaning that valuable resources are not available which could compromise cases	The use of public defenders should be mandatory
__label__noRel	newspapers are meant to inform, not to be discussed. The comment section is not necessary.	We can remove it fairly by making rules and monitoring the comment section.
__label__Support	Having separate public and private defenders contributes to economic inequality by making it so poor people have to pay more long term cost (a convicted felon never getting hired again vs. paying a lawyer one time).	The use of public defenders should be mandatory
__label__noRel	This leaves space for people to bully and be toxic without any consequences	Every person should be traceable, so they are accountable. If your comments consist of hate speech or are offensive then you be accounable.
__label__noRel	I think with people reading less newspapers both hard copy and online, Print subscription circulations have fallen by 7% over the past two years, from 125 million overall to 116 million, while single-copy sales are down 11%, from 3.2 million in the first half of 2019 to 2.8 million in the first half of this year.17 Dec 2021, the papers are not going to give the time and effort to monitor the comments sections when there's nothing in it for them.	I am reminded while discussing this of the way Daily Mail in UK handles the comments section. It just mentions on top of the comments page that theses comments are not moderated.So it allows everybody to express their opionion. This is how it should be done in my opinion
__label__noRel	I agree with Lawrence we can't give up on the notion that nothing can be, at first we might not get it right but with more options and exploring other things eventually there will be a solution that will prevent users with hate speech from participaating	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	We should tax items based on the sustainability goals of the United Nations. This would make it possible to tax exploitation pollution of natural resources, CO2 & other greenhouse gas emissions, violation of human rights or terrible working conditions, no matter if the product is a plastic bag, an unsustainable t-shirt, a service, some food or a complex financial product.	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used...

__label__noRel	I'm not very sure that an automated system is the answer. There are many cases of false positives, particularly when other users attempt to have a discussion with the offender. The machine picks up on keywords used commonly in hate speech and the users attempting a discussion may use these keywords as well.	I have read through some of the cooments and my stance is still the same. It is no doubt that hate speech is a problem, however, not allowing the public the opportunity to comment on issues may not only be a problem against freedom of speech, it may also cause the newspaper to lose some of its loyal readers if they're not able to engage with the content shared by the newspaper.
__label__noRel	People will say whatever they want even mean things and say it is free speech.People should learn to be kind to others without using free speech as an excuse	Despite my defence of human moderators, it seems they too are flawed -- check out this article https://www.technologynetworks.com/informatics/news/ai-trusted-as-much-as-humans-to-flag-hate-speech-365777 -- human moderators are not only prone to bias but also impractical. With the huge wealth of content posted every second online, it is unrealistic to expect humans to be able to view, criticise, and moderate every single comment.

__label__Attack	how do you decide what is disrespecful?	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated.

__label__noRel	I disagree - people should comment where it is appropriate but not on topics where the public is largely misinformed or can spread misinformation such as climate change. Comments on topics like celebrities are ok because they ultimately don't matter when compared to an important science-policy debate.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	Yes I agree, I feel that we are probably fairly used to sifting through the rubbish on the internet, and at times the trolls can be entertaining, as long as it isn't nasty.	There will always be a few bad apples in a batch just as there will always be bad people among humanity. Honestly the easiest method of combatting this issue is through the utilization of manual review teams perhaps hired by the newspaper or even paid through revenue made by the articles failing that approach bots can be instantiated with the programmed capability of removing comments that have flagged contents inside them.

__label__noRel	while free speech is our right and we are entitled to our own opinions, when you are promoting/endorsing hatred and discrimination of any sort, the line should be drawn. having a discussion/debate with opposing sides is normal and gives insight to both sides with little bias, but that cannot be used as an excuse to be hateful or discriminatory.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it.

__label__noRel	What you are suggesting means that free speech should be limited to those articles that won't generate a conversation. If you look at https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/10/news-sites-that-turn-off-commenting-dont-drive-users-to-social-media-instead/ it shows that restricting or reducing comments can inflame a situation and cause irrational and trolling.	"I found this really interesting, ""Khan said the freedom of opinion and expression, including the right to seek, receive and disseminate diverse sources of information, must be upheld by States in times of crises and armed conflict as a precious ‘survival right’ on which people’s lives, health, safety, security and dignity depend."" This is similar to what lots of people have been saying regarding worrying that this sort of censorhip could overextend.

__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way.

__label__noRel	I agree	There should be a strict comment management system in place, someone has to supervise it and react (and possibly penalise) to users spreading hate speech.

I think this allows for a more fruitful and productive discussion that on other platforms e.g. social media. However, hate speech is certainly an issue and easily derails conversations.

__label__noRel	It has been suggested that hiding comments rather than removing them is the best way forward. Commenters don't like their posts to be deleted, understandably, and often feel censored which can cause them to lash out with further offensive comments. By hiding a comment, the original poster can still see it and may not realise that it has been hidden from others which minimises upset caused to others whilst preserving the original poster's involvement. https://blog.brandbastion.com/deleting-comments-can-trigger-backlash	I disagree.

The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__noRel	the same as my idea	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__noRel	Absolutely all such attempts merely lead to new types of misinformation. People get excited and carried away. They might go into the project with a clear conscience hoping to 'defend the truth' but end up spreading fake news and defending the point of view they hold.

The good news is that people are adjusting to the new reality of ever-growing, all-pervasive misinformation by evolving a bullshit detector.

__label__noRel	This may be challenging for newspaper websites with large audiences and therefore a great deal of traffic (which is a likely goal for most/all newspaper companies). The volume of new comments following a breaking story would likely be quite great and the task would very taxing for moderators. If the proportion of content that is hateful is quite high, you may be looking at quite a bit of burnout amongst the moderators who may quickly grow cynical, jaded, and emotionally exhausted from filtering out so much hatred and profanity.	Addressing hate speech does not mean limiting or prohibiting freedom of speech.

__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Agreed. And many of these potential solutions are also not successful at limiting harmful content (https://slate.com/technology/2018/05/the-facebook-upvote-and-downvote-experiment-is-a-bust.html). As long as the platform is comforming to the laws of the country then it should not have to introduce further measures to limit hate speech at the expense of preventing free and open discussion.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem

Before being able to comment on newspaper websites, users should be required to sign up using traceable methods (eg. some form of identification). The comment section should regularly be monitored and any users who post hate speech should face serious consiquences
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.

__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.

__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment

Newspaper articles should constantly ready and delete hate speech comment.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	To ensure freedom of speech is still maintained, moderation needs to be carried out fairly. To achieve this, we need to understand what is hate speech and what are the lines that seperate that with constructive criticism.

Appropriate materials are currently less available, but fitting inappropriate materials is already against current building codes of practice; urgent training for the building industry in appropriate materials would result in increased demand and scaled-up production, driving costs down.	Cost of upgrades, which are always higher for properties in a heritage setting, are unaffordable for individual owners in low wage, low property value areas.
__label__noRel	Sadly I must agree. Ongoing monitoring of comments would take too much effort and time. It is simpler to just remove the comments and let the newspaper articles stand for themselves. Pople can always link the article to their own twitter post and comment there if they feel the need to add their own thoughts.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	Alternatively I'd offer the opinion that goes against the question and states that we shouldn't offer a space for readers comments (and thus hate speech) at all on news since it's primarily a site and source for news. Systems like https://ground.news/ have been providing news and removing bias without a social aspect already and since third party social/sharing/commentary sites handle discussion and the problem of hate speech far better than newspaper websites presumably can hope to, the solution seems intuitive: remove it and let that happen organically on other websites and platforms.
__label__Support	Agreed, just a simple implementation of guidelines can go a long way just as stated in the following article https://help.ft.com/faq/commenting-on-articles/what-are-your-commenting-guidelines/	Instead of removing the comment section newspapers can try and look up new and different ways to facilitate their reader engagement.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	A possible way to address hate speech on newspaper sites would be to incorporate both human moderators and some sort of AI that monitors for hateful words and comments. The requirement to submit personally identifying information before commenting might also help because without this then anyone can create a fake name that hides the person's true identity so therefore more likely to engage in hate speech. If personal information is required, then hate speech would be less likely.
__label__Support	I agree, newspapers should remain impartial as much as possibe and outsource the management to a third party that most consumers of media can agree on to form that structure for defining and removing comments.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted.

__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	Newspaper websites should use human or artificial intelligence-based moderators who can impartially identify hate speech and remove it from their platforms without removing or censoring genuine, constructive comments and perspectives. If AI is used, certain terms and phrases can be added to a database and comments containing them flagged for moderation to remove hate speech fairly.
__label__noRel	I agree, public debate is good.	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	Maybe the only solution is to remove the space for comments? We see the same issues on other platforms that allow comments!
__label__noRel	Agreed, just a simple implementation of guidelines can go a long way just as stated in the following article https://help.ft.com/faq/commenting-on-articles/what-are-your-commenting-guidelines/	We can have a system where every comment has to be checked and vetted for hate speech and if it infringes on any of the platform's rules and regulations then the comment is automatically removed.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Moderating comments sections is a lot of work to do manually, the individuals tasked with it would burn out in short time trying to manage that effectively while also having to read hateful garbage all day. If there was a system to remove hate speech it needs to be automated with an algorithm that catches certain words, then reviewed manually when someone disagrees with the content removed and it not being against guidelines. We use guidelines for everything including media regulations for accurate reporting or having to retract when information is not accurate. It's no different in the comments section, it doesn't remove free speech it regulates it to create a healthy environment to have a conversation in. Over moderation can have as severe of an effect as under, it has to be a system that takes in common complaints from both sides. Not the hate speech side per say but the sides of people who are pro free flowing conversation and those who want more shielding to avoid extremist echo chambers.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	I am reminded while discussing this of the way Daily Mail in UK handles the comments section.

__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	i believe commenting should have it's policy, where users have to read the policy before commenting. So if a user uses language that promotes hate speech, the comment should be removed.

__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	yes. the website can simply have words that are not accepted in the comments. this can minimize or eliminate hate speech altogether	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	Despite my defence of human moderators, it seems they too are flawed -- check out this article https://www.technologynetworks.com/informatics/news/ai-trusted-as-much-as-humans-to-flag-hate-speech-365777 -- human moderators are not only prone to bias but also impractical. With the huge wealth of content posted every second online, it is unrealistic to expect humans to be able to view, criticise, and moderate every single comment.

Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__noRel	Yes this is a very important consideration in that we dont operate in a homogenous society. and culturally we are not the same, so what I consider harsh hate speech might just be considered banter to another group of society.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Having read all of the previous discussion surrounding this debate, I still stand by my original opinion. Moderating comments by an official representative of the newspaper doesn't allow for free speech. We do however, need to eliminate hate speech. I think the best way to do this is to put this in the hands of the community and other readers.

__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	After doing some follow up reading from https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/what-is-online-hate-crime/ I have seen how the anonymity of these online comments can be what makes it so easy for people to be hateful. Therefore, an easy solution would be to make it impossible for people to comment anonymously, and have people have to provide personal information. However, I am not sure how this would work from a data protection point of view. It is certainly a start.

Clearly defining what hate speech is with links to the definitions in every format is what could help.

__label__noRel	Unfortunately, people do seem to struggle with self-censorship, especially when anonymous and hidden behind a keyboard.

There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__noRel	that is actually true positive criticism	Many people are against the reducing of hate speech from newspaper article, and I am with them on this. The main reason for putting comment section on newspaper websites was for readers to leave a comment, people will always have something to say whether it is good or bad. But AI can still be used to remove comments that can be severely harmful.
__label__noRel	I think using AI would not prove to be very effective. If this AI was to be self-supervised (without any moderators) I think it would quickly start flagging not-hateful comments as hate speech since it's very susceptible to user input - see what happened to Microsoft's Twitter bot Tay. After a couple of weeks, if I'm not mistaken, the AI started posting very hateful tweets about the holocaust and minorities.	The difficulty with reducing hate speech, is that it is everywhere. It cannot feasibly be reduced with human power, but rather requires a computer system.

__label__noRel	Removing the comment section will not prevent hate speech from occurring. People will find an alternative online platform, e.g. forums. Instead, companies should focus on moderating the comment section/providing links as to why posts that may be flagged are harmful. We need to focus more on prevention as opposed to reaction.	Community moderation is used on many platforms to allow discussion whilst preventing hate speech from arising, however this is greatly dependent on human participation which can take a lot of work depending on the size of the community. Additionally, the removal of hateful comments can better a comment section, but will not change a commenters views- this has led to the development of more insular online communities fostering these more extreme or hateful views. People will create a space for their commentary if there isn't one provided (or if their comments are removed from somewhere). A lot of this comes down to what a given newspaper wants to be associated with (in the sense of their brand) as opposed to maintaining the sanctity of online discussion.

Moderating comments sections is a lot of work to do manually, the individuals tasked with it would burn out in short time trying to manage that effectively while also having to read hateful garbage all day. If there was a system to remove hate speech it needs to be automated with an algorithm that catches certain words, then reviewed manually when someone disagrees with the content removed and it not being against guidelines. We use guidelines for everything including media regulations for accurate reporting or having to retract when information is not accurate. It's no different in the comments section, it doesn't remove free speech it regulates it to create a healthy environment to have a conversation in. Over moderation can have as severe of an effect as under, it has to be a system that takes in common complaints from both sides. Not the hate speech side per say but the sides of people who are pro free flowing conversation and those who want more shielding to avoid extremist echo chambers.

__label__noRel	Unmoderated online comment forums are magnets for noxious speech. For years they have carried people’s discontent out into the world, while the writers sit safely behind screens. It’s almost bittersweet to think back on the time we once blamed internet flaming on the online disinhibition of middle school pranksters. It is the many unhappy adults in the electorate who are posting the things they are really thinking in comment boxes. Nearly three-quarters of internet users – 73 percent – have witnessed online harassment. News website comment sections host antagonistic conversations between contributors. Nine out of 10 respondents of a Pew Research study said the online environment was more enabling of criticism. The squabbling can be overwhelming: As many as 34 percent of news commenters and 41 percent of news comment readers identified argumentative comments as the reason they avoid reading or joining the discourse. Multiple studies show online communities develop sophisticated norms that guide participants. Anger begets more anger. Unshackled digital vitriol is now volleyed back and forth online from all sides. Some commenters don’t even care if they are anonymous anymore. Researchers have found real-name comments on social media are actually nastier than unsigned commentary. Historically, American democracy always had some rudeness baked into it. For example, during the presidential election of 1800, incumbent President John Adams’ campaign proclaimed “murder, robbery, rape, adultery and incest will all be openly taught and practiced” if his opponent, Thomas Jefferson, won the presidency. Jefferson, meanwhile, described Adams as “a hideous hermaphroditical character,” with “neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman.” Civility in public discourse is often what people in power expect of their citizens. Demands for civility can be used by those with authority to deny power to those with none. People who feel marginalized or alienated use incivility and civil disobedience to fight the power. By causing offense and indignation, as we saw during Campaign 2016, outsiders gained massive attention for their cause. Yet “democracy only functions when its participants abide by certain conventions, certain codes of conduct and a respect for the process,” wrote cultural journalist Neal Gabler in an eloquent essay about how a hateful electorate threatens democracy. Gabler noted that the 2016 presidential campaign was referred to as the “hate election” because everyone professed to hate both candidates. It turned out to be the hate election, Gabler mused, “because of the hatefulness of the electorate.” He went on:	After doing some follow up reading from https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/what-is-online-hate-crime/ I have seen how the anonymity of these online comments can be what makes it so easy for people to be hateful. Therefore, an easy solution would be to make it impossible for people to comment anonymously, and have people have to provide personal information. However, I am not sure how this would work from a data protection point of view. It is certainly a start.

__label__noRel	that is true there are many ways to reduce hate speech from newspapers	I think we firstly have to call out hate speech in order for people to learn that it is not okay and unacceptable. The reason being online 'haters' tend to abuse their right to free speech such that it infringes upon the next person because they have the comfort of knowing that nobody will find put who they really are and confront them. By calling out users on the newspaper website and responding to their comment as the moderator of the comments, and actually suspending their accounts because of it can go a long way.

The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them.

Alternatively I'd offer the opinion that goes against the question and states that we shouldn't offer a space for readers comments (and thus hate speech) at all on news since it's primarily a site and source for news. Systems like https://ground.news/ have been providing news and removing bias without a social aspect already and since third party social/sharing/commentary sites handle discussion and the problem of hate speech far better than newspaper websites presumably can hope to, the solution seems intuitive: remove it and let that happen organically on other websites and platforms.
__label__noRel	Yep, it needs to be a holistic approach. People have a right to speech but they need to be educated in how to express them kindly.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__noRel	Thats why its best to have set rules. Like swear language, certain words, threats and stuff like that but anything that is just opinion should be allowed no matter if you disagree or don't like what is said.	Moderating comments could be a viable solution. The use of AI could make it easier given that there could be thousands and thousands of comments, too much for human moderator/s to keep track of.
__label__noRel	Yes, I totally agree with this.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	I think having moderators who check the comments and remove any that contain hate speech is the best way of reducing it.
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	If we are to ban everyone who post a hateful comment we would be infringing on their basic right of freedom of speech.

Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	I agree with Richard in so far as newspapers to this point mostly haven't had very successful moderating systems. Either they are unaware of current methods of spreading misinformation or they bring down the ban hammer so quickly that it makes their comments confusing	I have already said that people who have already displayed hate speech on a website should be banned from giving their opinion.
__label__Attack	Who gets to decide what constitutes a 'controversial topic'? This is still a form of censorship and should not be allowed.	One solution to reduce hate speech is by disabling the comment section altogether for most important topics/controversial topics.

__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.

__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	A possible way to address hate speech on newspaper sites would be to incorporate both human moderators and some sort of AI that monitors for hateful words and comments. The requirement to submit personally identifying information before commenting might also help because without this then anyone can create a fake name that hides the person's true identity so therefore more likely to engage in hate speech. If personal information is required, then hate speech would be less likely.

One cost-effective way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites while promoting reader comments is to outsource reader comments to social media.

Issues around hate speech bring into clear relief the emergence of private spaces for expression that serve a public function, this may lead to violence or non-radical behaviors for the public at large. The only possible way of reduction is for writers to not write or give out any opinions of hate speech. This will ensure that readers are comfortable.
__label__Support	Unmoderated online comment forums are magnets for noxious speech. For years they have carried people’s discontent out into the world, while the writers sit safely behind screens. It’s almost bittersweet to think back on the time we once blamed internet flaming on the online disinhibition of middle school pranksters. It is the many unhappy adults in the electorate who are posting the things they are really thinking in comment boxes. Nearly three-quarters of internet users – 73 percent – have witnessed online harassment. News website comment sections host antagonistic conversations between contributors. Nine out of 10 respondents of a Pew Research study said the online environment was more enabling of criticism. The squabbling can be overwhelming: As many as 34 percent of news commenters and 41 percent of news comment readers identified argumentative comments as the reason they avoid reading or joining the discourse. Multiple studies show online communities develop sophisticated norms that guide participants. Anger begets more anger. Unshackled digital vitriol is now volleyed back and forth online from all sides. Some commenters don’t even care if they are anonymous anymore. Researchers have found real-name comments on social media are actually nastier than unsigned commentary. Historically, American democracy always had some rudeness baked into it. For example, during the presidential election of 1800, incumbent President John Adams’ campaign proclaimed “murder, robbery, rape, adultery and incest will all be openly taught and practiced” if his opponent, Thomas Jefferson, won the presidency. Jefferson, meanwhile, described Adams as “a hideous hermaphroditical character,” with “neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman.” Civility in public discourse is often what people in power expect of their citizens. Demands for civility can be used by those with authority to deny power to those with none. People who feel marginalized or alienated use incivility and civil disobedience to fight the power. By causing offense and indignation, as we saw during Campaign 2016, outsiders gained massive attention for their cause. Yet “democracy only functions when its participants abide by certain conventions, certain codes of conduct and a respect for the process,” wrote cultural journalist Neal Gabler in an eloquent essay about how a hateful electorate threatens democracy. Gabler noted that the 2016 presidential campaign was referred to as the “hate election” because everyone professed to hate both candidates. It turned out to be the hate election, Gabler mused, “because of the hatefulness of the electorate.” He went on:https://theconversation.com/how-news-sites-online-comments-helped-build-our-hateful-electorate-70170	This is not just a newspaper comment section problem... it's a social media problem as well, more like an internet problem.

Thus freedom of speech should be no different. Poeple need to be held accountable for their mistakes, so everybody else's rights will be protected. So having a set of keywords which are not allowed to be used is a way of reminding the writter that using the offensive word he/she is trying to use is considered a crime. An additional way to handle that is having the flag option by users and a team of moderators who follow a standard and will verify if flagged comments should be maintained or not. Lastly, anonymity might bring a feeling of impunity and even its possibility, so a way to avoid that is allowing one profile per person/email, where a fake username can be set, but, in the backstage, the website will know who it is that wrote each comment.

However, I hope that the personal information will be verified, and the information will be used to promote change rather than to punish individuals. In this regard, laws may be necessary to protect online commentators.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__noRel	I agree	every comment submitted by readers must be checked internally for hate speech
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/19/npr-comments-decision-guardian-readers
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Hate speech is not just someone's opinion. It affects people's lives with real consequences, resulting with cases such as severe depression and suicide. https://www.journalofcommunication.ro/index.php/journalofcommunication/article/view/322/307	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	parents who want a biological child but can't need surrogates in order to have their own genetic children.	Surrogacy should be banned
__label__Support	Criminalizing holocaust denial cuts down on anti-semitic acts by making it clear that no actions of this kind will be tolerated by the government.	Holocaust denial should be a criminal offence
__label__Support	I share the same opinion on that having a bot that can check for hate speech is the way either block users who use hate speech or put them on time out.	The comments could be checked for hateful speech. For example, there could be a bot or something (I do not know the exact name) that checks for any hateful words and eliminate that comment.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	I agree. A big importance for newspapers is the comment section and people's opinion to what they have written. Although, the companies should take some responsibility to monitor the comments and what the other users will see.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	Hate speech can be positive criticism and essential in some posts, altgough it can be offensive and totally uncalled for in other posts. A way in which social media apps regulate and monitor the comments, otherwise people have rights to freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	We need very close moderation as this in all likelihood is the best way to ensure hate speech does not spread, human interaction is key as algorithms do not do a very good job
__label__noRel	Should reduce hate speech and other inappropriate comments	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	It is easy to be hateful online when you are anonymous. Before being able to comment on newspaper websites, users should be required to sign up using traceable methods (eg. some form of identification). The comment section should regularly be monitored and any users who post hate speech should face serious consiquences
__label__Attack	nobody is forced to take out a payday loan; their existence affords the general population a choice of ways to borrow money.	Payday loans should be banned
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	a parent knows best what is good for their kid	Homeschooling should be banned
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	This could be considered less democratic and biased only showing positive comments. https://www.proquest.com/openview/87a0114d041605296b4dd4dd32634b4d/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750	All the posts should be checked before being posted and verified by some sort of AI. Hate speech could affect a person's livelihood and mental state
__label__Attack	Making the use of public defenders mandatory is an unfair obligation placed on a state.	The use of public defenders should be mandatory
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	Surely this would depend on the opinions and ideas of the moderators in some cases unless they followed some standards such as what the UN outline here on hate speech... https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech	I kind of agree, but I think that organisations have a responsibility to put something in place to monitor their comment sections. Even if it's not an algorithm and it's an actual person instead! Although your link shows how difficult this would be for a huge organisation like FB.
__label__Support	This could be done through public opinion, such as what the general public would consider less restricted and what is acceptable in current society.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	I agree with this comment sections can provide excellent reccomendations, for example: https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/oct/20/steely-dans-20-greatest-songs-ranked	I think you can put a price to the website- a subscription to readers.
__label__noRel	"I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that ""less restricted"" criteria should be?"	Hate speech blocking should not be implemented, people must learn to take some criticism in a positive way, it can be helpful.
__label__noRel	television is company for lonely people who perhaps do not have any other human contact during the day.	We should end racial profiling
__label__noRel	If it helps us understand and support them why not?	Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	I believe if we can be on the same page and let the media tell the story the truth with out lashing out on it.
__label__noRel	Definitely polarised but can't imagine it ending well. You'll just turn it into a hate echo chamber.	Removing the comment section from online newspapers is not the answer. Allowing people to post their opinions is healthy and a normal part of human society- people will not always agree. However, in order to reduce hate speech, which can so often lead to crime, it could be done so that there are monitors (either human or computer) who check comments before they are posted to ensure they are not hate speech.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	Less Issues with arguments and trolls	I believe that with real time moderation , if the comments can be removed before causing any distress to people then this is a better option than removing the ability to make comments.
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	But some publishers are indeed deciding to pre-emptively remove comment sections, whether across the entire site or just for specific articles they expect to lead to problematic comment sections - see some of the links within https://digiday.com/media/comments-sections/	Monitoring of comment areas is not realistic
__label__noRel	I disagree. National sovereignty is excellent for big and strong nations like China or USA. But if you're from a medium or small-sized country then 'national sovereignty' doesn't really exist. Simply because superpowers can force you to act in their interest. Strength brings sovereignty. EU sovereignty is much stronger than any nation in Europe. We need to focus on finding the right balance between national and European sovereignty.	We need better ways of migration.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	Having read all of the previous discussion surrounding this debate, I still stand by my original opinion. Moderating comments by an official representative of the newspaper doesn't allow for free speech. We do however, need to eliminate hate speech. I think the best way to do this is to put this in the hands of the community and other readers.
__label__Attack	Some people are arguing that English is not born in India and hence we should avoid using it. This statement lacks logic because all the technological innovations we are now using were born in different parts of the world. We cannot reject things just because they are not Indian.	Hindi should be the national language of India
__label__noRel	I agree with you on this, it's helping someone with a job, and it protects the person in the article from hate speech.	By simply educating people about what harm hate speech can do to a person
__label__Attack	Surrogates are protected by legal contacts ensuring that they are reimbursed for their time and expenses.	Surrogacy should be banned
__label__Attack	homeschooling is a good option for children who are bullied, giving them a safe place to learn	Homeschooling should be banned
__label__Support	social media has made it more difficult than ever for people to interact face to face.	Social media brings more harm than good
__label__noRel	This may be challenging for newspaper websites with large audiences and therefore a great deal of traffic (which is a likely goal for most/all newspaper companies). The volume of new comments following a breaking story would likely be quite great and the task would very taxing for moderators. If the proportion of content that is hateful is quite high, you may be looking at quite a bit of burnout amongst the moderators who may quickly grow cynical, jaded, and emotionally exhausted from filtering out so much hatred and profanity.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	"I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that ""less restricted"" criteria should be?"	Some people will always use hate speech and hide behind their computer, There needs to be some sort of filter added to flag such comments and people and a ban put on the user
__label__noRel	have profiles that are always flagged totally blocked	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	Free speech is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it is necessary for an effective democratic society and on the other hand, people tend to abuse the right. Newspapers and publishing companies are major symbols of free speech, however, and there will always be disadvantages to be endured, hate speech inclusive. The solution is not to disable comment spaces but to continually implore and push for cooperation amongst readers.
__label__noRel	writers will not know how the reader feels	"We need a more thick skin with some of our debate topics if we want to win arguements against ""hate"""
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	Almost half of India’s mother tongue is not Hindi. There are 22 officially recognized regional languages in India. Making a majoritarian language the national language is unconstitutional.	Hindi should be the national language of India
__label__noRel	pay is the primary motivational factor for executive level employees, thus executive compensation should not be capped as it would affect their performance.	The use of public defenders should be mandatory
__label__Support	I agree muting certain offensive words can have an impact on how much hate speech gets through on the website	Ensuring there are rules to adhere to, perhaps muting certain offensive words or phrases. Making sure commnect sections are heavily monitored.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	The editor must appoint a diverse panel, meaning from different backgrounds to screen comments
__label__Attack	vocational education funds would be better used in higher education which is more important as the workplace becomes more computerized	We should subsidize vocational education
__label__noRel	i dont agree, it is too controlling , there needs to be a middle ground of moderating	Having read through the opinions of others, my stance has not completely changed. It is important to censor comments, freedom of speech does not always equate to disrespecting the views and opinions of others. While I agree that comments should be censored, I do not agree that every comment should be removed. As mentioned before, a system can be implemented that removes comments with certain words, thus making the comment section a safe space for all who use it.
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	I agree that there is no need for comment sections under newspaper articles when most of the comments end up being a form of hate speech. A separate platform to discuss these articles would be better as it could be more easily monitored.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	but the amount of comments is what puts too much of a strain on moderators	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	the space exploration can be private and get money from private funds, why should we keep it?	Payday loans should be banned
__label__Support	definately comments section should be monitored before it gets out to the public	I believe that people are allowed to express their opinions , that is why we have freedom of speech. However with that right, we are not subjected to hate speech, there are so many ways of expressing yourself without using offensive or hateful words. Considering a newspaper is a public platform, I believe everyone should try to be respective at all times. The comment space must not be removed, it helps to get insights of readers and is very helpful. I think the website should be enhanced in a way that it detects offensive language and doesn't allow the reader to continue if they use such. Also, comments should be monitored before being posted to the public.
__label__noRel	polygamy is disgusting and devalues women.	Payday loans should be banned
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way.

__label__noRel	The proposal of the Sardines to reform EU asylum policy is an excellent proposal, well and thoroughly written.	The EU should improve public management and anti-corruption mechanisms
__label__noRel	Again, good point. Maybe there should be a daily limit on how many posts can be removed? (In order to avoid publishers becoming reliant on retrospective fixing, rather than their initial checks - which are where the problem originates).	I think there must be a system that will detect hateful comments and block them.
__label__Support	Investing in R&D will create an incentive system for businesses to start with green solutions.	We should invest in R&D
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	The EU must take a strong position against corruption and be in favor of an independent, supranational proscecutor that is the EPPO.	We should be realistic wrt. migration.
__label__noRel	Well then what is your proposition	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	Yes, the most easy way to make sure that people don't spread hate speech any further would be to educate people on the steps that should be done before posting any of your opinions. https://www.thecommentingclub.co.uk/sharing-your-opinion/	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	Yes it is not a solution because people will no longer discuss the contents of the article, we should keep the comment section open	By using a tool to search for hate speech
__label__noRel	Technology can help but isn't the ultimate solution. We need to reduce overall consumption.	Policy makers have vested interests with industry to ignore signals of overshoot and straining risks. Whatever action will be taken too late and there is no way to prevent feedback loops
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	Filter comments or have a ban on words that come across as hateful.
__label__noRel	Agreed.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	The newspapers should encourage the victims of hate speech to report hate speech published, establish monitoring and evaluation units in newsrooms. Some units should be tasked with monitoring hate speech trends, compiling reports and bringing these to the attention of key institutions
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Support	Algorithums	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	"I used to moderate a forum. The administrator set up various parameters for keyword triggers. There would be a lot of spurious reports due to poor spelling or grammar use - for example you would get a post flagged up for mentioning the word ""hoe"" however from the entire sentence it was clear they actually mistyped ""home"" - the system is not foolproof."	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	Heavy taxation of imported goods will encourage the relaunch of European production, which has better social values	We should tax heavily or refuse to import products not manufactured in the European Union that do not comply with our climate standards
__label__noRel	I definitely agree	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	Very clever Allison. Bizarre that I have to choose whether your comment supports or opposes Dominic's argument, such as it is. That's not how discussion works.	the best way to address hate speech to make it clear to the viewers regarding the consequence of hate speech. Also, only individuals who have registered on the platform after providing their details can be allowed to comment. furthermore, new accounts must be placed on a probation period and cannot be allowed to comment on the same day that they are created.
__label__noRel	But have you considered which one has more serious effects and consequences? I think that should be guiding in the main argument on whether to allow commenting or allow hate speech	Freedom of speech can be used as catch-all term to justify the use and propagation of bigoted and hateful language. If we accept that some language is not acceptable due to it's clearly hateful nature then we have to acknowledge that some form of censorship of those particular instances has to occur. I would suggest that eliminating all such spaces from newspaper websites would have a massive detrimental effect on valid, non-bigoted, freedom of speech a cornerstone of western life. We don't ban all cars because some people speed dangerously, we monitor the roads and ban the bad drivers. I suggest that as long as readers comments are monitored continually they should remain.
__label__Support	Adaptation is not giving up and I agree that effort made to do this is a good idea. The more people think about this, the more likely they are to achieve changes without even realizing they are doing it. Adaptation doesn't mean we are giving up on the environment. It means we are not stressing so hard over the guilt of what we perceive we have done to damage the earth.	Human resources and efforts are best used adapting to the effects of climate change, rather than attempting to mitigate climate change itself.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	I think I would prefer to see that comments sections are removed rather than untruths being pushed at people.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	Make readers agree to not sharing hate speech and let them know that if they do, they will be blocked from commenting.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	People constantly find their way around word filters and more often than not it filters a lot of genuine non hate comments too.	I think there has to be a system that can verify whether a person's comment contains hate speech and if it is found to contain hate speech, that person should not be allowed to leave the comment.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	I agree, some people will attack you without getting the context of the article and latter on realise that they where wrong. At time is already late	Removing the comment section should not be an option, we should not lose the right to freedom of speech based on the likelihood that a few may post hateful comments, strict moderation and being able to report hate speech is the solution. Having people sign up for platforms and use ID to which they could be held personally accountable is an option as well. Hate Speech often comes from being able to hide behind a keyboard, screen and a fake username.
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed.

__label__noRel	I agree with this statement, however, we all know that users will just sign in under another ID. But agree in principal.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Monitoring of comment areas is not realistic
__label__noRel	I agree	The best solution would be one that elegantly ties the reduction of hate speech in the comment section with no detrimental effect to the publics freedom of speech. This could be done by setting guidelines for hate speech, and also ensuring that the public provides identifying information such as their email address and especially their phone number. Both can be tracked to the person. To take it even further would be to be able to collect data such as ip addresses( with the commenters permission of course) when the person sends their comment so as to be able hold them accountable for any hate speech they send in. This will prevent people from using such language and hoping to hide under anonymity.

One of the root causes is poor education and people not knowing any better, as is stated in this post by United nations: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/impact-and-prevention/preventive-role-of-education. on the UN post, it is said that: ""The United Nations Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech places specific emphasis on the transformative power of education as a fundamental tool to address the root causes and drivers of hate speech, and to promote peaceful, inclusive and just societies for all"" as they have realised how big of an impact education has on reducing hate speech."	Research has shown that hate speech can be effectively controled since freedom of speech is not absolute

__label__Attack	Disagree. I think that newspapers have always been allowed to 'sell' information, but news sites do so at their own risk by eliminating vast swaths of subscribers and advertisers. A good reliable newspaper is also the best long term business model	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

__label__noRel	I agree. Children should be taught in schools the value to expressing their opinions but also the difference in expressing and opinion and spreading hate.	Newspapers and free speech functioned well for a couple of hundred years without instant comments. People used to write letters to the newspaper, including their name.

__label__noRel	and what do we filter?	Comment space encourages discussion of important topics and allows free exchange of information and so should not be eliminated. Independent moderators should be used in order to ensure that hate speech is quickly deleted and encourage users to express their ideas without using inappropriate or aggressive language.
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	I have read through some of the cooments and my stance is still the same. It is no doubt that hate speech is a problem, however, not allowing the public the opportunity to comment on issues may not only be a problem against freedom of speech, it may also cause the newspaper to lose some of its loyal readers if they're not able to engage with the content shared by the newspaper.

__label__Attack	To reduce hateful speech on newspaper website, I think every newspaper must have their own admin, who monitors the comment posted and remove hateful speech and if an indvidual continue they must get blocked.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	the best way is for companies to filter hate speech and remove it as long as the criteria for hate speech comes from an independent organisation. If companies themselves govern what is hate speech then we would become subject to there rules which you would lose the point of freedom of speech. Also there should be more support in the community for people who are being targeted in hate speech attacks.

__label__noRel	Abuse and hate speech shouldn't be tolerated	Readers should be able to comment but be informed of certain comments that would be considered hate speech. If they are aware and still choose to comment hateful words, the newspaper website should feel comfortable enough to remove those comments since the reader was informed that comments like those would not be acceptable.
__label__Attack	hate speech is discrimination, but people should be free to express themselves on websites because not every comment will be hate speech and other people inspire other from comments, without the comment space people will be unable to interact online.

Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry.

__label__noRel	you admitted that this 'ain't true'. Although hate comments may not initially cause any physical harm, the psychological damage caused by hate comments is bad enough and can eventually lead to physical damage too.	The best way to curb hate speech would be to have the comments section moderated for any forms of hate speech.

__label__noRel	An idea doesn't have to be aggressive to be classed as hate speech. It could be dismissive or belittling, or just downright repugnant. Would you be happy to see Nazi opinions put forward in a happy, smiley way?	I don't think it's fair to eliminate comments from newspaper articles because the public is entitled to have their opinions heard. The best way to deal with hate speech is to moderate each comment before it is posted. Also the newspaper could ban accounts who engage in hate speech in the comments section. This moderation could be done through both human moderators and software to find trigger words signifying hate speech. It's important to democracy that citizens can have their say on the issues that affect their lives.

Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Removing the comment section from online newspapers is not the answer. Allowing people to post their opinions is healthy and a normal part of human society- people will not always agree. However, in order to reduce hate speech, which can so often lead to crime, it could be done so that there are monitors (either human or computer) who check comments before they are posted to ensure they are not hate speech.

__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.

__label__noRel	I completely agree as people will just go elsewhere and make it much more worse.	I think that definition of hatespeech needs to be laid out clearly as I think different people have different ideas on what constitutes hatespeech - perhaps if there was a kind of premediation that informs the user that what they are engaging in qualifies as hatespeech it may make them more likely to reconsider their messages introducing a form of self moderation as well as external moderation
__label__Support	there are some people out there for who having to provide personal information will not be a deterrant to hate speech	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

I know this has been discussed a few times potentially in reply to comments but I'd like to repeat it again: language is complex and you can't simply ban or flag certain terms or phrases and think you catch all the hate speech comments etc. While a report button and the use of a software that can support a human moderator is in essence a good idea, it might also delete comments that do not actually contain HS or completely miss others overall. I think this decision by the newspaper turned into an entire discussion of manageability of monitoring discussion sections and away from the ethical considerations.

__label__Support	That is actually a good idea, but gives a lot of power to the moderators.	I believe hate speech should be moderated and perhaps shadow-banned. That way users who post comments which are marked by the moderators as hate speech would never know they were banned and would not create new accounts or post more hateful comments.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	One way I propose to prevent hate speech is to remove anonymity online. Not being able to hide should limit cowardly behavior and thus reduce harmful speech.
__label__noRel	I am not sure collecting data about the person before posting will help with tracing them down and trying to re-educate them.

__label__noRel	I agree that this question is subjective to an extent - news matter varies and can often be divisive or challenge certain views. However, I think moderation could first take into account the relevancy of certain comments (i.e. personal quips, etc.). Bullying or other clearly offensive comments (racist, sexist, ableist etc.) contributes nothing to a discussion, so it should be moderated. Comments that lend to the wider argument (however contrasting) should be regulated at the newspaper's own discretion.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed

Completely doing away with the comment section would not be beneficial to the readers experience as reading other peoples thoughts is what sets online media apart from offline media. It plays a role in keeping the discussion going. It would be smart to rather monitor comments to ensure hate speech or utterances of a vile nature are greatly reduced through the use of some sort of algorithm that picks up on problematic words and deletes comments or it being done manually by people who will moderate the comment section.

__label__noRel	I agree with both of these ideas. Having a moderation means consistency, but having other readers flag comments allows other commenters to hold peers to account and ensure that the comment section is an inclusive and fair section.	There is no cure for hate speech, but there is a way to stand up against it. Speak out against hate speech - fight racism and bigotry with love, empathy, compassion, and strength.

__label__Support	i agree that if people are going to use social media they need to expect hate	It goes further than this. We live in a society that has a lot of cry babies. We need to be impervious to negative comments from strangers on a social platform and that is anonymous. Most people need to grow a pair, develop a spine or stop being cry babies. Once this is achieved you will see that any contribution you make to a discussion will be debated in a civilized manner.
__label__noRel	The newspapers aren't reading consumer input though. The only people reading the comments section are other consumers. The only purpose they serve is announcing your views to everyone else reading the same article.

I have read through some of the cooments and my stance is still the same. It is no doubt that hate speech is a problem, however, not allowing the public the opportunity to comment on issues may not only be a problem against freedom of speech, it may also cause the newspaper to lose some of its loyal readers if they're not able to engage with the content shared by the newspaper.

__label__noRel	I agree that there is no need for comment sections under newspaper articles when most of the comments end up being a form of hate speech.

I agree with the notion that being able to share our thoughts and feelings is a right and having people share their views can help people to question their own thoughts.

The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

It is still pretty clear what is being said and bybasses the system that says I can not use that word for example.	I think there has to be a system that can verify whether a person's comment contains hate speech and if it is found to contain hate speech, that person should not be allowed to leave the comment.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.

__label__Attack	https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/05/reader-comments-on-news-sites-we-want-to-hear-what-your-publication-does/ This article highlights what effect hate speech has on readers in the comments sections	lts true hate speech should be taken as positive criticism
__label__noRel	It is their responsibility though because if someone feels unsafe on their platform due to hate commentary then they lose customers and in some eyes may endorse hate speech by not doing anything to address it or try and filter it.	The best way to curb hate speech would be to have the comments section moderated for any forms of hate speech. In this manner people who have an opinion with substance can have a say in whatever article that was published.
__label__noRel	I believe that punishment would cause more polarization because people may have more negative feelings towards newspaper websites with comments sections. Like what AllisonK said, education is a better preventative measure. If punishment is necessary, it should involve education that the commentator actively engages in.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	we need to take control of criminals and hold them responsible for their actions.	Blockade of the Gaza Strip should be ended
__label__noRel	It is still difficult because then you are removing everyone's entitlement to an opinion	Rarely some very sensitive articles should be allowed to switch off comments sector.
__label__noRel	I don't agree. There are too many people who shouldn't have access to the Internet. They hide behind their PC screens and writes a lot of things they would never dare to say in reality. They believe they can say everything that comes to their minds when they can hide behind a PC screen, and that lowers the quality in the comments section. And there are laws against racism and other topics than they can use as triggers.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	But some publishers are indeed deciding to pre-emptively remove comment sections, whether across the entire site or just for specific articles they expect to lead to problematic comment sections - see some of the links within https://digiday.com/media/comments-sections/	Hate speech is a problem but we do need to have debate. We need to respect different views and allow people to voice their opinion where necessary to further a debate on a news topic. Having the comments vetted before they appear does allow for some censorship but that must not be at the cost of open discussion.

__label__noRel	I also agree with this position. letting people fully express themselves will fully enable sourcing The root of the problem	The only way to combat hate speech is through open debate. Restricting any form of speech (even hate speech) could lead to hateful views becoming unchallenged and potentially result in violence. There is also the issue that newspapers could define hate speech as certain comments they don't like destroying any potential for open debate. By maintaining open debate hate speech can be called out and as a result, become less frequent.

It plays a role in keeping the discussion going. It would be smart to rather monitor comments to ensure hate speech or utterances of a vile nature are greatly reduced through the use of some sort of algorithm that picks up on problematic words and deletes comments or it being done manually by people who will moderate the comment section.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	Agree, it is essential to monitor hate	reducing hate speech on the newspaper websites is possible without taking the drastic measures of completely cancelling the comment section one way of doing that there should be moderators who approve the comment before they are published on the website.
__label__noRel	I think people are completely aware that they are spouting 'hate' messages, they just don't care. Education is a total waste of time. They are bullies.

The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them.

There is enough research now to show the direct links between hate speech and hate crimes	Removing the comment section from online newspapers is not the answer. Allowing people to post their opinions is healthy and a normal part of human society- people will not always agree.

I think this allows for a more fruitful and productive discussion that on other platforms e.g. social media. However, hate speech is certainly an issue and easily derails conversations. While moderation of hate speech would be ideal, the burden on the newspaper is likely too great to do this manually.

Restricting any form of speech (even hate speech) could lead to hateful views becoming unchallenged and potentially result in violence.

The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

Being able to cull commentary automatically this way is potentially even more damaging if your concern is freedom of speech.	A possible way to address hate speech on newspaper sites would be to incorporate both human moderators and some sort of AI that monitors for hateful words and comments. The requirement to submit personally identifying information before commenting might also help because without this then anyone can create a fake name that hides the person's true identity so therefore more likely to engage in hate speech.

__label__noRel	Correct	Freedom of speech can be used as catch-all term to justify the use and propagation of bigoted and hateful language.

I would suggest that eliminating all such spaces from newspaper websites would have a massive detrimental effect on valid, non-bigoted, freedom of speech a cornerstone of western life. We don't ban all cars because some people speed dangerously, we monitor the roads and ban the bad drivers. I suggest that as long as readers comments are monitored continually they should remain.

Agreeing with others here: a standard of moderation would have to be communicated to the user, with straightforward policies of flagging or reporting potentially hateful comments.

I don't think it's fair to eliminate comments from newspaper articles because the public is entitled to have their opinions heard. The best way to deal with hate speech is to moderate each comment before it is posted. Also the newspaper could ban accounts who engage in hate speech in the comments section. This moderation could be done through both human moderators and software to find trigger words signifying hate speech. It's important to democracy that citizens can have their say on the issues that affect their lives.

Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them.

A lot of people would not go through the effort of completing this if they just want to spread hate.

The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

Having news discussed by people is what sparks change in our society, so they are still important and probably shouldn't be removed!	I think in order to eliminate hate speech, the comment section itself must be completely eradicated to take a way all potential risk. Newspapers have the sole purpose of giving accurate depictions of current events, there is no responsibility for them to offer social commentary space. One only has to look at the hatred filled comments of the Daily Mail web pages to see the concerning language being used on a regular basis.

There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.

Human or digital moderators (AI) could be used to identify comments and phrases constituting hate speech and remove them from the platform without hindering people's ability to share their authentic views.

I know this has been discussed a few times potentially in reply to comments but I'd like to repeat it again: language is complex and you can't simply ban or flag certain terms or phrases and think you catch all the hate speech comments etc. While a report button and the use of a software that can support a human moderator is in essence a good idea, it might also delete comments that do not actually contain HS or completely miss others overall. I think this decision by the newspaper turned into an entire discussion of manageability of monitoring discussion sections and away from the ethical considerations.

Education in media ethics: The first step in combating tribalized hate speech is realizing that, while the right to free expression is a fundamental human right, the rise of social media has produced a number of different channels for its creation, packaging, and transmission. The rights and liberties of journalists and their role in fostering and developing peaceful societies should be emphasized in media ethics education. The political, social, and cultural rights of individuals and groups, including the freedom of expression, must be made more widely known, as well as the obligations and societal repercussions that come with press freedom. Journalists need to have the knowledge and abilities to spot hate speech and disseminate anti-hate messaging.

There is a role for AI (which I have said before I know) to try and weed out and remove anything that is just pure hate and not any sort of coherent argument or opinion.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes.

I personally get very annoyed if I watch or read something and want to express my opinion, then go down to the comment section to sadly find out the comments are turned off. This limits the freedom of speech and blocks the ability for the people to vent out somehow. I think this builds aggression and causes problems afterwards.

Keep opinions to social media and let people thrash it out there.

__label__Support	Regulation of the comment section will definitely help reduce the hate speech	Removing the comment section all together is a fair point as news is meant to be fair and impartial. People share their opinions based on their biases and that's not what the news is for - that's what social media is for. But in this case allowing the comment section to remain would be great if people would not abuse the power to share freely by sharing hate speech and slander. us as humans need to be regulated by a set of rules in order to keep a functioning society and i think a filtered comment section is the solution.

__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform.

Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__noRel	Freedom of speech comes with a responsibilty, and if people are not responsible with their rights, there should be measures put into place to fix that	The best solution would be one that elegantly ties the reduction of hate speech in the comment section with no detrimental effect to the publics freedom of speech. This could be done by setting guidelines for hate speech, and also ensuring that the public provides identifying information such as their email address and especially their phone number. Both can be tracked to the person. To take it even further would be to be able to collect data such as ip addresses( with the commenters permission of course) when the person sends their comment so as to be able hold them accountable for any hate speech they send in. This will prevent people from using such language and hoping to hide under anonymity.
__label__Attack	passing legislation on free speech is difficult especially in countries with entrenched codified constitutions	I feel that people should be allowed to have freedom of expression online but should be held accountable for vitriolic and unbased hate speech, this could be achieved by proving identity and by using citations and references when posting online

By having clear rules and removing posts that break rules and not based on opinion or thought. You can allow people to say controversial things as long as they stay within some boundaries	There should be a strict comment management system in place, someone has to supervise it and react (and possibly penalise) to users spreading hate speech. The comments should not be anonymous since people feel more inclined to be hostile when hiding under a pseudonym. Maybe asking to verify your identity before posting a comment would make people think more before spreading hate.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

I personally get very annoyed if I watch or read something and want to express my opinion, then go down to the comment section to sadly find out the comments are turned off.

A possible way to address hate speech on newspaper sites would be to incorporate both human moderators and some sort of AI that monitors for hateful words and comments. The requirement to submit personally identifying information before commenting might also help because without this then anyone can create a fake name that hides the person's true identity so therefore more likely to engage in hate speech.

The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them.

Sometimes a society has to confront its own ugliness/hatred head on, and removing it might do more harm than good (ie making commenters feel persecuted, perhaps making them even more hateful or violent). I also agree that still being able to access the newspaper might help change their minds.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	People can express them selves however they like but they must be mindful to their language.

Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed

__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	I know this has been discussed a few times potentially in reply to comments but I'd like to repeat it again: language is complex and you can't simply ban or flag certain terms or phrases and think you catch all the hate speech comments etc. While a report button and the use of a software that can support a human moderator is in essence a good idea, it might also delete comments that do not actually contain HS or completely miss others overall. I think this decision by the newspaper turned into an entire discussion of manageability of monitoring discussion sections and away from the ethical considerations.

Similar to other social media platforms, users of the platform perhaps should be allowed to flag or report comments that aren't appropriate,and then a moderator should check the report and take the steps necessary to make the platform a safe space.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	The website must have words that are automatically marked as unacceptable. whenever those words are included in a comment, the website must privately warn the sender and not allow the comment to go through until the comment is rephrased correctly and politely.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	Reducing hate speech shouldn't be the focus. The problem lies in the reactions to it - in particular, giving the drastic perspectives too much attention. This attention only encourages more of the debate and problematic perspectives. Though total ignorance would also be unfair, so really we need a position of just LESS attention and care given to such perspectives.

__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	There needs to be rules and regulations stating the type of comments that can be made about other people. There should also be verification of a persons identity everytime they make a comment so that is visible who the statement was made by. Newspaper articles should constantly ready and delete hate speech comment.
__label__Attack	It does take away freedom of speech on the website	Alternatively I'd offer the opinion that goes against the question and states that we shouldn't offer a space for readers comments (and thus hate speech) at all on news since it's primarily a site and source for news. Systems like https://ground.news/ have been providing news and removing bias without a social aspect already and since third party social/sharing/commentary sites handle discussion and the problem of hate speech far better than newspaper websites presumably can hope to, the solution seems intuitive: remove it and let that happen organically on other websites and platforms.
__label__noRel	I agree	Free speech is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it is necessary for an effective democratic society and on the other hand, people tend to abuse the right. Newspapers and publishing companies are major symbols of free speech, however, and there will always be disadvantages to be endured, hate speech inclusive.

__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	Many people are against the reducing of hate speech from newspaper article, and I am with them on this. The main reason for putting comment section on newspaper websites was for readers to leave a comment, people will always have something to say whether it is good or bad. But AI can still be used to remove comments that can be severely harmful.

While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

I remember that the European Union - with the Venice Declaration of June 1980 - played a key role in pushing the Palestinians to the table of negotiations. That text was much criticized at that time, but with the benefit of insights, it was right! Europe has become more and more marginal in the peace process and this has contributed to a much-aggravated situation where problems are even more difficult to resolve than 40 years ago and create room for despair and violence.

Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry.

__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	A possible way to address hate speech on newspaper sites would be to incorporate both human moderators and some sort of AI that monitors for hateful words and comments.

If personal information is required, then hate speech would be less likely.

Having read through the opinions of others, my stance has not completely changed.

__label__Support	I agree. As per 'The Free Speech Balancing Act of Digital Intermediaries: An explication of the concept of content governance' (Johnson, Brett (2015)' online news outlets face several competing duties: to promote free speech, to prevent harm, to obey the law, and to make money. Their entire business model relies on discourse and to prevent that is to deny readers/users the very service they claim to be providing. Some kind of voting system would allow harmful comments to be surpressed by the users themselves. It should really be left to the platforms themselves to figure out a way to manage potential hate speech (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00550-7#Sec4) through their own platforms as they have a responsibility to both limit harmful speech but keep discussion free and open.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	I definitely agree on the part of sciencing valid criticism	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Attack	Hate speech is a nonsense concept.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

Freedom of speech can be used as catch-all term to justify the use and propagation of bigoted and hateful language.

__label__Attack	Arguably it could be in the newspaper's self-interest to police hate speech even if we say that it's not necessarily their responsibility, as moderation of comment sections has been shown to reduce perceptions of bias of the article itse lf (see e.g. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369118X.2017.1356861)	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

I don't think it's fair to eliminate comments from newspaper articles because the public is entitled to have their opinions heard. The best way to deal with hate speech is to moderate each comment before it is posted. Also the newspaper could ban accounts who engage in hate speech in the comments section. This moderation could be done through both human moderators and software to find trigger words signifying hate speech. It's important to democracy that citizens can have their say on the issues that affect their lives.

So having a set of keywords which are not allowed to be used is a way of reminding the writter that using the offensive word he/she is trying to use is considered a crime. An additional way to handle that is having the flag option by users and a team of moderators who follow a standard and will verify if flagged comments should be maintained or not. Lastly, anonymity might bring a feeling of impunity and even its possibility, so a way to avoid that is allowing one profile per person/email, where a fake username can be set, but, in the backstage, the website will know who it is that wrote each comment.

Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

Similar to other social media platforms, users of the platform perhaps should be allowed to flag or report comments that aren't appropriate,and then a moderator should check the report and take the steps necessary to make the platform a safe space.
__label__Support	I agree that having at least one moderator present would reduce/eliminate hate speech. It could be done after comments are automatically submitted (delete the hateful comments after public viewing within a certain time frame) or, even better, they can only be posted after careful consideration by the moderator(s), permitting only positive comments.	I agree that the only way to ensure balanced discussion without allowing hate or eliminating genuine responses is through moderation of comments before posting
__label__Attack	"The thing is if people filter these comments, they may not work as accurate as AI. For example, they may use their own judgements to decide if something is appropriate. If we use AI, we can simply add new filters, like words or phrases, AI will filter all comments in the way we ""teach"" it."	I think the first step to reducing hate speech in readers comments should be in the form of a moderation team in which they filter inappropriate comments. I think it should be a group of people rather than AI to do this to ensure all hate speech within a variety of contexts are eliminated, as if this was done by a computer there is risk of hate spilling through. For example, hate speech on the social media platform Twitter can often be missed as users purposefully misspell hateful speech to ensure it does not flag up on the AI searches, going as far as hateful language misspelt actually trending on Twitter.

__label__Support	totally agree	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	I think people having to give personal data will make people think before they post hate speech or negative comments.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words.

__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	I don't want to see the comments space removed as it amounts to censorship. I'd much rather that people saw what other people thought and were able to consider it. Hopefully, readers will recognise when some people are irrational and will not add fuel to the fire. Good moderators would help but they mustn't be trigger happy. They must allow dissent and only remove what it clearly offensive.

__label__noRel	I agree, Article 19 of the ICCPR guarantees the right to freedom of expression but also disallows discrimination.

Also all submitted comments must be thoroughly checked for negative for flagged words or topics.

There is a fine line between freedom of speech and hate. And hate can be interpreted differently for different people causing biased censorship.

__label__noRel	Eliminating the space for reader comments would be violating free speech, in my opinion it would be much better to have every incident recorded as a Non-crime hate incident'.

__label__Support	I think my idea is very good	I think we can do this by having comments sufficiently moderated and removed if needed if they are producing hate speech.
__label__noRel	Anonymity is at least as much as important as Identity. Today it is very easy to be anonymous, but hard to prove the identity of opinion and establish a public web of trust.

__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.

__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	This is an interesting point - I wonder if some websites already use AI to moderate user comments and posts.

There needs to be a way to stop the hate spreading but also still give people the oppertunity to express their comments so i think this is a good idea	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	The Russian Federation is our neighbor. We share common historic and cultural ties with them. Today the EU confronts Russia with sanctions.

The EU should enforce the obligation to respect the Rule of Law within its borders

This would prevent readers from freely using hate speech.
__label__noRel	the vow of celibacy is too important to do away with. it shows that there is nothing more important than the church and is a true goal worth striving for.	Surrogacy should be banned
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.

In today's world where technology has advanced to such a degree, I'm of the belief that creating parameters that protect individuals from any form of hate speech is very much possible through things such as AI.

__label__noRel	Flagging comments does work with limited effectiveness, however, like with social media, you will always invite people who want to censor anything they disagree with. Those individuals try to utilize flagging and reporting, ase a tool to bully those that they do not agree with. That is not an effective way to deal with actual hate speech.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	I fully agree that the recreational drugs that cause the least harm should be legalized. It is an illusion that the smuggling of such drugs can be controlled. Billions of euros have been spent trying to combat smuggling but have not reduced the supply of such drugs. Legalization of the least harmful drugs will allow the quality of the drugs to be controlled (hence reducing harm); reduce exposure to more harmful drugs (because dealers currently introduce users of soft drugs to harder drugs), and cut out a significant source of drug dealer revenues.	We should legalize non-violent drug use

__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	It is important that people are able to have a voice, especially as it can be a great tool in educating people, and giving people a variety of viewpoints that they wouldn't necessarily get to often hear. Sometimes we learn best by hearing and understanding the views of other people. We don't have to necessarily change our opinions, but it can help us become more aware of why or how people feel a certain way about things.

__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	The only way to combat hate speech is through open debate. Restricting any form of speech (even hate speech) could lead to hateful views becoming unchallenged and potentially result in violence. There is also the issue that newspapers could define hate speech as certain comments they don't like destroying any potential for open debate. By maintaining open debate hate speech can be called out and as a result, become less frequent.
__label__Attack	Agree and come to an agrrement of which part should be removed, or find a better way of writing it which does not have any hate speech in it	Yes there must be a a strong policy for reviewal before publishing.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	I think one way of eliminating hate speech is to filter the comment section by certain words that are considered hateful.

This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

Alternatively I'd offer the opinion that goes against the question and states that we shouldn't offer a space for readers comments (and thus hate speech) at all on news since it's primarily a site and source for news. Systems like https://ground.news/ have been providing news and removing bias without a social aspect already and since third party social/sharing/commentary sites handle discussion and the problem of hate speech far better than newspaper websites presumably can hope to, the solution seems intuitive: remove it and let that happen organically on other websites and platforms.

__label__noRel	writers will not know how the reader feels	Many people are against the reducing of hate speech from newspaper article, and I am with them on this. The main reason for putting comment section on newspaper websites was for readers to leave a comment, people will always have something to say whether it is good or bad. But AI can still be used to remove comments that can be severely harmful.
__label__Support	Definitely discussions should be moderated - so much extra info and nuance comes from reading the comments below an article, but not is the comments section turns into a free-for-all	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

Lastly, anonymity might bring a feeling of impunity and even its possibility, so a way to avoid that is allowing one profile per person/email, where a fake username can be set, but, in the backstage, the website will know who it is that wrote each comment.

__label__noRel	Again, good point. Maybe there should be a daily limit on how many posts can be removed? (In order to avoid publishers becoming reliant on retrospective fixing, rather than their initial checks - which are where the problem originates).	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Support	I think the practicalities of providing identity verification could be tricky. For instance, you could have people attempting to pose as others and posting inflammatory statements.	A possible way to address hate speech on newspaper sites would be to incorporate both human moderators and some sort of AI that monitors for hateful words and comments. The requirement to submit personally identifying information before commenting might also help because without this then anyone can create a fake name that hides the person's true identity so therefore more likely to engage in hate speech. If personal information is required, then hate speech would be less likely.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	Censoring speech prevents progress as a soceity. (https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2016/04/free-speech-important/)
__label__noRel	That is actually a good idea, but gives a lot of power to the moderators.	Every person should be traceable, so they are accountable. If your comments consist of hate speech or are offensive then you be accounable.

__label__Support	Correct	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information.

__label__noRel	you can't exclude people from their own community	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

With rights comes responsibility. We all have freedom of speech but it is our responsibility to ensure that our speech does not cause harm on others. If people do not want to be responsible in their speech, then their speech should be reduced because things have consequences. So, the hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by removing comments with hate speech or having a software that can identify hate speech in a comment before it is posted.

There needs to be rules and regulations stating the type of comments that can be made about other people. There should also be verification of a persons identity everytime they make a comment so that is visible who the statement was made by. Newspaper articles should constantly ready and delete hate speech comment.

__label__noRel	internet is not a devil, people are	Online comment spaces should be platforms promoting free speech, with some restrictions in place.

__label__noRel	I absolutely agree with this. As we've seen recently (https://medium.com/dfrlab/alt-right-and-alt-social-media-4fa23eb2fbd1) cracking down on the more ofensive comments on one website can lead to groups of people finding a more lenient place and bunching up there, creating a vicious cycle where they push each other to be more and more extreme.

__label__Attack	re-education will not help some people	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__noRel	"Your post contains the argument, ""Newspapers should cancel comment space because it can create... fake news."" I don't think this is particularly convincing. By that logic, newspapers and news websites themselves should be cancelled since they will periodically create ""fake news"" - sometimes not due to malice but rather by an honest mistake [or journalist incompetence/ignorance]. Ben Goldacre, for example, runs (ran?) a blog called, ""Bad Science"" and a recurring motif was journalists failing to accurately depict scientific insights. We could argue that their exagerrations and mistranslations could be construed as ""fake news"" but there's no malice involved. The journalists weren't trying to deceive anyone. The solution to getting closer to an approximation of truth is not to remove an entire avenue of communication, but rather to open up (regulated) communication in the hopes that the arguments that are most cogent rises above the rest - and that the logical wheat be separated from the illogical chaff. That is to say, I think we need a better system than just, ""let's get rid of the comment section."" It's a tricky problem, no doubt, and a perfect solution may not exist.

The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
