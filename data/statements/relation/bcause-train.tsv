__label__Support	We need to take immediate steps and put a full stop on organisation who are playing with our future just for a quick buck.	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Support	While I agree that it is getting harder every year, we need to do something about it now. It's never going to be an easy process, but the sooner we start, the better.

__label__Attack	I agree that the sooner we act the better. Every day climate change grows.	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Attack	I agree. What does it help to not even try to change the advancement of climate change?	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Attack	I believe that too much damage has already been done by governments around the world especially due to geoengineering tactics that have already caused harm that cannot be reversed.	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year

__label__Support	I think we can fight climate change I don't think it is too late yet.	Human resources and efforts are best used adapting to the effects of climate change, rather than attempting to mitigate climate change itself.

__label__Support	We do have to adapt and evolve with the shifting climate. It's too late to halt the process entirely.	Human resources and efforts are best used adapting to the effects of climate change, rather than attempting to mitigate climate change itself.
__label__Attack	Humans have very little effect on what can be done to eradicate such a large problem.

__label__Attack	It seems that massive industrial scale projects are what caused climate change. Large scale industry is a major cause of pollution.	We can only achieve by tremendous advances and investment in technology: clean energy production, CO2 capture in massive scale, hydrogen planes, ... , and much much more
__label__Attack	I don't think these are all realistic goals.	We can only achieve by tremendous advances and investment in technology: clean energy production, CO2 capture in massive scale, hydrogen planes, ... , and much much more
__label__Support	The thing here is, if we don't do it, then there's nothing we have to look forward to. Anything else will be null and void without a planet to live on.	We can only achieve by tremendous advances and investment in technology: clean energy production, CO2 capture in massive scale, hydrogen planes, ... , and much much more
__label__Attack	Yes the costs are very high and most technologies in the [past have failed such as wind turbines etc which need electricity which cancels the effort	We can only achieve by tremendous advances and investment in technology: clean energy production, CO2 capture in massive scale, hydrogen planes, ... , and much much more
__label__Support	These investments don't all have to be a negative thing - they can lead to massive job growth and prosperity, if designed and implemented correctly.

__label__Attack	Human spoiled the nature to a great extent and they have to face the consequences and should avoid doing more harm to the environment any further.	The nature itself correct the human inflicted changes and balance the climate. But the human should bear the losses in this process
__label__Attack	I agree. We already have lumber shortages as it is and this will only get worse as time goes on unless we do something. Deforestation has caused a lot of issues and reversing that could go a long way in helping to stabilize the climate once again.	Technology can not correct this problem unless u can grow more trees as quick as possible using technology.
__label__Attack	Technology can help. Planting trees can also help but isn't the single solution. We need to simultaneously adopt many strategies and methods to fight climate change.	Technology can not correct this problem unless u can grow more trees as quick as possible using technology.
__label__Support	I completely agree with this. There are multiple exposes and car engineering shows were independent organizations show not only that we can reduce carbon emissions, but that we can also run cars way more efficiently with our current fossil fuels. If people demand the same level of efficiency with future fossil fuel using vehicles we can begin to make real changes. This will in turn give us the time necessary to begin building the infrastructure necessary for those alternative fuel sources as we will need to build electric gas stations and charge stations around the country before demanding an increase in those alternative vehicles from organizations.	I think we have to look into alternatives fuels and see how we can cut down on the consumption. The main onus is on big organisations since they are major defaulters.
__label__Support	Companies strategically and purposely try to shift the blame and responsibility onto individual consumers. We need regulations and government intervention to force change on a larger scale, or companies will continue to irreparably damage the environment for short term profits.	I think we have to look into alternatives fuels and see how we can cut down on the consumption. The main onus is on big organisations since they are major defaulters.
__label__Attack	Even though damage is done, there are ways to counter the damage through other actions. If enough of these are done, they can cumulatively overpower the irreversible actions and thus reduce climate change as a net overall.	Some damage towards the climate is currently irreversible to prevent reversal in time.
__label__Attack	Climate Change is the main issue It causes a lot damage to our environment Thanks to some of the volunteers who are helping to fix the issue by sharing the issues in mass media to cover up a lot of people	I do believe that climate change is an issue but we need to put the blame to big organisations and put the onus on them to reverse it.

__label__Attack	Its not a easy thing to inconvenience people more than they already are.	I think the best thing for people to right now is to reduce or eliminate their consumption of products that contribute to climate change.

__label__Support	Well said, its been here this long, I think its safe to assume it will stay that way for a long time.	Think about it life has not been on earth as we know for a very long time, maybe 50- 60 thousand years. The earth has been around for what a trillion years. So what will go first.

Climate change will never be reversible, humans are humans and far to many either do not believe it is happenings or cannot find the time to do any thing about it.

I think that generally speaking, climate change can be corrected for the future. But we need big corporations to be on board, and the federal government to start mandating it.
__label__Attack	This is the main problem that we are facing in the climate issue because some peoples are not considering the climate change problem. So the environment awareness is less.

Every year that passes we lose tools or opportiunities that could work to counteract climate change as well as more damage is added - therefore is -unfortunately- irrevrsible

__label__Support	Exactly, if not mandated there's also a strong negative social pressure effect where many people who are actually in favour of wearing masks don't dare to do so because of fear of being the social outlier or even treated aggressively.

__label__Attack	We shape our social lives in physical space all the time. We now 'live' also in a digital world. We can shape our digital lives and we must do this by not taking the "easy" way out, by using the tools at our disposal and by questioning and creating new tools to control our digital space.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.

__label__Attack	The dangers of allowing free speech has been constantly seen in different moments.

Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	I agree that hate speech should not be tolerated, but I don't think that it requires the total removal of space for comments, as the comments add value.

While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	It would be irresponsible for newspaper publications to not police comments as they are giving the platform for people to voice their opinions. Them turning a blind eye to hate speech could be mistaken as them endorsing or condoning those utterances. The following article serves to support my stance and should you wish maybe you can take a second to read though it. https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Support	Everyone has a different interpretation of what could be aggressive. The soultion would be to remove the comment section and people can go to many different forums if they want to discuss articles	Everybody should be able to express its own idea.

__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

__label__Support	I agree having an algorithm to delete specific words and phrases.	I think you could ban some words or have someone checking the comments and deleting the ones that are unappropiate, but limiting the whole comment section would be a mistake
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks.

__label__Support	I agree. If deleting comments is left to a group of a moderators, those human beings inevitably have their own personal opinion and will take a certain stance on any topic. This gives some individuals an unfair amount of power, and it can very well result in, for lack of a better word, "echo-chambers" where the vast majority of comments support a certain stance and anyone who criticizes that stance will get dogpiled.

While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	This is not a realistic approach at this time. With the definition of "hate speech" becoming more and more loose and up for interpretation, this sets a dangerous precedent of government and law enforcement overreach. The only time where law enforcement may need to get involved is with blatant calls to violence - physical violence - or inciting hatred against a targeted individual or group. I agree somewhat with this point, but not in the direction things are starting to head in today's times.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	I disagree. I think other readers of hate speech could be influenced by it making the issue spread even further. You can share your opinions without using hate speech and with a balanced approach so it should be removed.

__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.

__label__Support	Totally agree. It still gives space to express but will limit the hate speech	We should all have the option to voice our opinion. If doing so can result in hate speech, then we have to find a way to fight it instead of trying to eliminate comments altogether.

__label__Attack	Your post contains the argument, "Newspapers should cancel comment space because it can create... fake news." I don't think this is particularly convincing. By that logic, newspapers and news websites themselves should be cancelled since they will periodically create "fake news" - sometimes not due to malice but rather by an honest mistake [or journalist incompetence/ignorance]. Ben Goldacre, for example, runs (ran?) a blog called, "Bad Science" and a recurring motif was journalists failing to accurately depict scientific insights. We could argue that their exagerrations and mistranslations could be construed as "fake news" but there's no malice involved. The journalists weren't trying to deceive anyone. The solution to getting closer to an approximation of truth is not to remove an entire avenue of communication, but rather to open up (regulated) communication in the hopes that the arguments that are most cogent rises above the rest - and that the logical wheat be separated from the illogical chaff. That is to say, I think we need a better system than just, "let's get rid of the comment section." It's a tricky problem, no doubt, and a perfect solution may not exist. But we should not let "perfect" get in the way of, "good enough." In a subsequent post, I detail ONE possible method that incorporates several solutions previously mentioned (and as I write this post, I thought of ways to improve it further. Not perfect, but perhaps good enough).	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__Support	True I totally agree. I think having certain policies in place before being able to comment will help.

It is important to censor comments, freedom of speech does not always equate to disrespecting the views and opinions of others. While I agree that comments should be censored, I do not agree that every comment should be removed. As mentioned before, a system can be implemented that removes comments with certain words, thus making the comment section a safe space for all who use it.
__label__Support	The best way to deal with the issues of hate speech might be to ban the use of specific words or phrases that may amount to hate speech. Removing the comment section completely just allows the publication to share whatever information they want without the opportunity to be challenged by the public.	I have read through some of the cooments and my stance is still the same. It is no doubt that hate speech is a problem, however, not allowing the public the opportunity to comment on issues may not only be a problem against freedom of speech, it may also cause the newspaper to lose some of its loyal readers if they're not able to engage with the content shared by the newspaper.

__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

__label__Support	The comment section should be a safe where everyone is free to place their opinion and ask question without someone making them feel somehow about themselves.

__label__Support	True. At the end of the day, the publisher controls what is published	I don't think it's fair to eliminate comments from newspaper articles because the public is entitled to have their opinions heard. The best way to deal with hate speech is to moderate each comment before it is posted. Also the newspaper could ban accounts who engage in hate speech in the comments section. This moderation could be done through both human moderators and software to find trigger words signifying hate speech. It's important to democracy that citizens can have their say on the issues that affect their lives.
__label__Support	I agree. This could prevent uninformed comments which usually lead to hate speech.	By allowing a section that briefly educates the viewers regarding the situation before they even get to the part of comment sections.

__label__Attack	I think the comment space should be monitored by the newspaper for a more standard approach, because a lot of people have subjective views on what hate speech could be.	Newspaper websites can have an option where other people could report the hate speech comment.

__label__Attack	This doesn't stop the issue of trolls creating a new account and commenting again.

__label__Support	agree	I think comments should be limited and all negative comments should be blocked
__label__Attack	but how do you reduce hate speech	Allow users to report comments.
__label__Support	agree	I think that fully blocking comments being allowed is detrimental to free speech, therefore comments should be allowed. However, there should be monitoring and banning of certain individuals if they are found to be continually hateful towards others.
__label__Support	I agree. Freedom of speech must not be quashed. There should be much closer monitoring of comments and removal of hateful/abusive ones.	I think that moderation is the most effective way of preventing hate speech. Filtering comments would not work as it is difficult to find a algorithm for the context of a comment. Free speech is so important it should not be removed.
__label__Support	I agree	I think everyone raised some good points already, but overall, it seems to be that some moderation is required no matter what, and that might be too costly for some smaller platforms to implement.
__label__Support	right	Allow others users to rate the comments and block those who receive bad ratings
__label__Attack	I'm not very sure that an automated system is the answer. There are many cases of false positives, particularly when other users attempt to have a discussion with the offender.

This research article provides more detail on this point: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/09/220916112424.htm	Newspaper websites should use human or artificial intelligence-based moderators who can impartially identify hate speech and remove it from their platforms without removing or censoring genuine, constructive comments and perspectives. If AI is used, certain terms and phrases can be added to a database and comments containing them flagged for moderation to remove hate speech fairly.
__label__Attack	it is censorship	Readers should be able to comment but be informed of certain comments that would be considered hate speech.

It’s almost bittersweet to think back on the time we once blamed internet flaming on the online disinhibition of middle school pranksters. It is the many unhappy adults in the electorate who are posting the things they are really thinking in comment boxes. Nearly three-quarters of internet users – 73 percent – have witnessed online harassment. News website comment sections host antagonistic conversations between contributors. Nine out of 10 respondents of a Pew Research study said the online environment was more enabling of criticism. The squabbling can be overwhelming: As many as 34 percent of news commenters and 41 percent of news comment readers identified argumentative comments as the reason they avoid reading or joining the discourse. Multiple studies show online communities develop sophisticated norms that guide participants. Anger begets more anger. Unshackled digital vitriol is now volleyed back and forth online from all sides. Some commenters don’t even care if they are anonymous anymore. Researchers have found real-name comments on social media are actually nastier than unsigned commentary. Historically, American democracy always had some rudeness baked into it. For example, during the presidential election of 1800, incumbent President John Adams’ campaign proclaimed “murder, robbery, rape, adultery and incest will all be openly taught and practiced” if his opponent, Thomas Jefferson, won the presidency. Jefferson, meanwhile, described Adams as “a hideous hermaphroditical character,” with “neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman.” Civility in public discourse is often what people in power expect of their citizens. Demands for civility can be used by those with authority to deny power to those with none. People who feel marginalized or alienated use incivility and civil disobedience to fight the power. By causing offense and indignation, as we saw during Campaign 2016, outsiders gained massive attention for their cause. Yet “democracy only functions when its participants abide by certain conventions, certain codes of conduct and a respect for the process,” wrote cultural journalist Neal Gabler in an eloquent essay about how a hateful electorate threatens democracy. Gabler noted that the 2016 presidential campaign was referred to as the “hate election” because everyone professed to hate both candidates. It turned out to be the hate election, Gabler mused, “because of the hatefulness of the electorate.” He went on:	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

__label__Support	I agree that education is important.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	I agree that the hate speech perhaps should not be entirely removed. Sometimes a society has to confront its own ugliness/hatred head on, and removing it might do more harm than good (ie making commenters feel persecuted, perhaps making them even more hateful or violent). I also agree that still being able to access the newspaper might help change their minds.	Hate speech should be flagged, hidden and the user should be given a strike. People should be able to still view those comments with a "trigger warning" disclaimer. After 3 strikes the user should be banned from commenting. But they should still be able to view the newspaper so that they don't miss an article that probably would have helped that particular person to change their behavior . More safe and reliable ways of verifying accounts should also be implemented.
__label__Support	In many ways, the debates confronting courts, legislatures, and publics about how to reconcile the competing values of free expression and nondiscrimination have been around for a century or longer. Democracies have varied in their philosophical approaches to these questions, as rapidly changing communications technologies have raised technical challenges of monitoring and responding to incitement and dangerous disinformation. United States. Social media platforms have broad latitude [PDF], each establishing its own standards for content and methods of enforcement. Their broad discretion stems from the Communications Decency Act. The 1996 law exempts tech platforms from liability for actionable speech by their users. Magazines and television networks, for example, can be sued for publishing defamatory information they know to be false; social media platforms cannot be found similarly liable for content they host.

I have heard stories about people ending their lives after their stories which often are embarassing are published, and the situation made worse by the comment section.
__label__Support	Recent congressional hearings have highlighted the chasm between Democrats and Republicans on the issue. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler convened a hearing in the aftermath of the New Zealand attack, saying the internet has aided white nationalism’s international proliferation. “The President’s rhetoric fans the flames with language that—whether intentional or not—may motivate and embolden white supremacist movements,” he said, a charge Republicans on the panel disputed. The Senate Judiciary Committee, led by Ted Cruz, held a nearly simultaneous hearing in which he alleged that major social media companies’ rules disproportionately censor conservative speech, threatening the platforms with federal regulation. Democrats on that panel said Republicans seek to weaken policies dealing with hate speech and disinformation that instead ought to be strengthened.

__label__Support	Really like that idea	You should be allowed to give your opinion to express your view about a news article. To moderate this or to filter what you can and cannot say would it stop it from being free speech. What really needs to be looked at is to see how you can stop online trolling which I think is the root cause of some of these comment sections become so toxic. But for the media who is so depended on free speech themselves so that they can report on news in an unbiased way to eliminate the comment space is almost hypocritical. Just a weird idea here but perhaps you should do a quick test or verification before you can comment. A lot of people would not go through the effort of completing this if they just want to spread hate.

Hate speech is so prevalent nowadays that proper measures should be taken in order to limit these harmful comments.

__label__Support	This is probably the optimal solution, but it also requires a lot of work force and might be quite expensive, too.	We can have a system where every comment has to be checked and vetted for hate speech and if it infringes on any of the platform's rules and regulations then the comment is automatically removed.
__label__Attack	Because hate speech causes so many unwanted consequences, this kind of liberal approach doesn't seem fruitful. Although education and counter-speech are important (https://www.coe.int/en/web/european-commission-against-racism-and-intolerance/hate-speech-and-violence), we have to protect free speech while eliminating comments that incite violence.	While hate speech can be harmful , it can also be helpful. If we can read through the speeches we can be able to determine what the problem is from the comments and improve.We can also create work limit on comments.
__label__Attack	I do not believe that the people writing hate comments on newspaper posts would spend time doing this, therefore, i feel like it would be a bad approach	Take a few minutes to breathe, meditate, and physically calm your body down before you start typing your response.

__label__Attack	I disagree, comments are how valid opinions are spread and change is made in the world.

__label__Attack	anyone writing things against the prevailing narrative will be shut down. George Orwell wrote this would happen and women would be the ones easily taken in and become enforcers.

I think that the warning system is a good route, as the AI might eliminate valid arguments and miss hate speech accidentally. A warning system would still need an AI, but it warns users that their comment may be hate speech and if it is, the user can rethink their wording or risk posting it. If they post it, maybe a manual review can happen to determine if it was hate speech or not.

__label__Support	I like that this comment shares the views of a doctor, from a genuine and respected source	This article below focuses on the negative views of the comment section.

__label__Support	great comment, thanks for adding verified sources which strengthens these ideas	In this same article, there is a section further down using reddit as an example.

__label__Attack	although I do think that, however, we should consider how many people do in fact post hateful comments without the protection of anonymity. look at Facebook, for instance - it's absolutely full of hate speech from people posting under their names using accounts that people can view and learn more about them. perhaps if people are truly hateful then being known for this isn't a problem for them after all.	An article proving AI can be helpful, but can struggle to interpret or detect certain things, suggesting manual reviewing is still very important. https://www.latrobe.edu.au/nest/can-combat-rise-online-hate-speech/ On another note, I also think anonymity plays a huge role in what people allow themselves to post online and think that certain platforms should consider only allowing people to comment under their own identity rather than online handles and such.

__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Support	I agree	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	Exactly, regulation is necessary, either by a software or an actual person	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	I disagree, comment sections allow the public to engage with the news and find people similar to them	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	People may not freely divulge what they actually think if they know they can be tracked down and "re-educated"!	Implementing a software that detects comments including hate speech, like the ones on social networks. Also including a report button for poeple to report hate speech comments
__label__Attack	But what can be done about it? Will anything be done even with a report button	Implementing a software that detects comments including hate speech, like the ones on social networks. Also including a report button for poeple to report hate speech comments
__label__Support	The problem with this is that the moderator themselves often have an agenda.	Someone should monitor the comments in the website such as administrator or moderator. Or comments need to review first by administrator before it can be posted on the website
__label__Support	I think so too. But would that not further allow for subjectivity to cloud ones judgement(the moderator)? I propose there be a guideline set as to what qualifies for hate speech, both by law and by the standards of the newspaper. That guideline should be posted in the newspaper or on the social media platforms and that will ensure that there is no grey area on the matter.	Someone should monitor the comments in the website such as administrator or moderator. Or comments need to review first by administrator before it can be posted on the website
__label__Attack	Disinformation is rampant: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/magazine/free-speech.html	Well..hate speech is a problem then there is freedom of speech as well. There is a possibility a writer is giving valid points.
__label__Support	I agree, people should have the newspaper identify hate speech, but also the newspaper needs to actually evaluate the reported comments	I'm not sure if it will work but they can put a sign on the website that says no to hate comments allowed. Or a report button can also help then administrator can review the reported comments
__label__Support	People would be more careful with what they say	The best solution would be one that elegantly ties the reduction of hate speech in the comment section with no detrimental effect to the publics freedom of speech. This could be done by setting guidelines for hate speech, and also ensuring that the public provides identifying information such as their email address and especially their phone number. Both can be tracked to the person. To take it even further would be to be able to collect data such as ip addresses( with the commenters permission of course) when the person sends their comment so as to be able hold them accountable for any hate speech they send in. This will prevent people from using such language and hoping to hide under anonymity.
__label__Support	Agreed, and it would still allow opinions to be shared	having a team that moderates the comments beforehand is a good idea.do not post comments that have hate speech.
__label__Attack	time consuming	having a team that moderates the comments beforehand is a good idea.do not post comments that have hate speech.
__label__Support	This article also discusses the use of moderators https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation	There needs to be a fine balance between freedom of expression and stopping hate speech. The best way is for comments to be screened as that would still allow opinions to be shared while ensuring the safety of all readers
__label__Attack	I disagree, try to read everyone's idea. Some are feasible and doable	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	But to what extent should free speech be allowed? Should we as a society allow people that say hateful things against a particular ethnic group, race or gender all in the concept of 'its free speech, you can say whatever' I think that people are able to practice their rights but as soon as it starts becoming oppressive or infringing on another person's right, that is where we should start drawing a line.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	I do agree with you, but I think the people also should have a way of reporting comments.	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Support	I absolutely agree. It's newspapers responsibility that these comments do not end up in their comment section.	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Support	i think so,people should be able to express their views but comments must be moderated	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.

__label__Attack	all criticism cannot be considered hate crime, sometimes it can be the harsh truth. How can we make sure these comments don't get deleted too.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	I agree with the idea that anonymity on the Internet often has the consequence to make it easier for people to harass / be horrible to each others.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

__label__Support	Some people are going through problems in their own life and express their anger online. None of which is acceptable.	Is space for readers comment really that necessary? Nowadays, with all other social medias available, the conversation can happen on platform made for dialogue. But as practice shows, those "conversations" are often very polarized and everyone is kind of screaming in a void.
__label__Support	This would be a great idea, however, it's also important to take into notice that everyone has their own biased; so one statement could be hate speech to one but not the other	The key way to do it would be with very in-depth moderation which is non-biased and respects criticisms but its aware when a comment is taken too far and viewed as hate speech. the comment section should not be eliminated but mainly moderated and supervised
__label__Attack	Awareness campaigns would not suffice. Real methods could be implemented to reduce (white supremacist) hate speech: "White supremacist speech is readily detectable, Hemphill says, detailing the ways it is distinguishable from commonplace speech in social media, including: Frequently referencing racial and ethnic groups using plural noun forms (whites, etc.) Appending “white” to otherwise unmarked terms (e.g., power) Using less profanity than is common in social media to elude detection based on “offensive” language Being congruent on both extremist and mainstream platforms Keeping complaints and messaging consistent from year to year" https://news.umich.edu/hate-speech-in-social-media-how-platforms-can-do-better/	By making people aware that hate speech is not good by creating awareness campaigns against hate specch.
__label__Attack	It is hard to rely on awareness campaigns, as people who write hate speech are not very interested in any awereness campaing	Awareness campaigns need to be implemented to teach people about the significance of avoiding hate speech.
__label__Attack	Using moderators and flagging can be abused to prevent valid comments. If the moderator doesn't like what you have written, or if there are several users who doesn't like you on the platform, they can abuse the flagging. Just look at YouTube and how many abuse the flagging to get rid of a channel or person who they don't agree with and who have strong opinions you don't agree with.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	I agree, and I think it's best to ban some words that will offend people. I also think the users who are trolls should be banned early on to protect the comment section.

__label__Attack	I don't agree. There are too many people who shouldn't have access to the Internet. They hide behind their PC screens and writes a lot of things they would never dare to say in reality.

__label__Attack	It is important to actually define what hate speech is before an agreed education policy can be enacted.

__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	I think people should have the right to comment but should do so respectfully.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	I disagree. In an Institute for Government webinar yesterday (24/10 https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/events/what-works-government-evidence-policy) the point was made that the public are not educated to challenge what they read in the media. It is therefore naive to assume that people would start to search around things they read in the news because 1) we are not taught how to do this and 2) there is no motive for people to begin to do this. Based on the amount of conspiracy documentaries on Netflix and YouTube it is possible that people would indeed search around what they read but for negative/conspiracy motives rather than as ground truthing.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	i agree with this, for there to be a clear definition before you post, not terms or rules in small writing	First, it would be important to define what hate speech is so that readers that want to post comments have a chance to self-modify their posts. Secondly, having a filter that will automatically block posts that contain proscribed words could also help to reduce the amount of hate speech featured in comments sections.
__label__Attack	The problem is some form of censorship would be required for writers if the definition of "hate speech" isn't universally agreed. Perhaps a trigger warning for readers of a sensitive disposition could be given at the start of an article. Different countries have different laws or understandings of hate speech. Will comments from different countries have to be blocked?	Issues around hate speech bring into clear relief the emergence of private spaces for expression that serve a public function, this may lead to violence or non-radical behaviors for the public at large. The only possible way of reduction is for writers to not write or give out any opinions of hate speech. This will ensure that readers are comfortable.
__label__Attack	you can't exclude people from their own community	I think that education with penalties such as exclusion from the community for repeated offences is the best policy. Like many I agree that some people are unaware they unaware they have caused offence to others.
__label__Attack	How much hate speech is there really on newspaper comments sections? Usually a difference of opinion is enough for some people to lurch for the "hate speech" card in order to get a comment removed because they don't like a different viewpoint.	However there is the potential to much greater exposure to it on online than in past times. Therefore I continue to believe that greater controls on those posting comments will decrease mindless hate speech and promote constructive debate.
__label__Attack	Free speech is the cornerstone of democracy - it can be political but it doesn't have to be. Democracies should protect those that are vulnerable from abuse online whilst also preserving the spirit of free speech. If this balance can't be achieved then it is dictatorship / authoritarian territory.	Addressing hate speech does not mean limiting or prohibiting freedom of speech. It means keeping hate speech from escalating into something more dangerous, particularly incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence, which is prohibited under international law. https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks.

__label__Attack	This closes the possibility of healthy debate and non-hate speech.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	It could reduce the presence of hate.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	I think it would take more than one person in many cases and have heard that professional moderators have to have appropriate support and training due to the nature of items that can be posted to such sites.	There needs to be proper moderation of comments so that no hate speech slips through the net. This would make more work for the newspapers but would only require one person to constantly monitor what is being submitted and only allow reasonable comments.
__label__Attack	I have heard some users fear this. For instance, those who post anonymously about their sexuality or gender in countries where they may face issues in cases of hacking/user info being made public.	I feel that all users should provide true identification that can be used if they use hate speech to find them/report them.
__label__Support	In theory, I really like this idea and feel it could minimise bullying and hate speech online.	I feel that all users should provide true identification that can be used if they use hate speech to find them/report them.
__label__Attack	I don't think they do. From what I see some newspapers want to know exactly how people feel even if what is written causing a bit of chaos	This is an interesting point - I wonder if some websites already use AI to moderate user comments and posts. I think AI could be trained to recognise hate speech, although it would have to be tested first as it could censor too much.
__label__Support	We really are in a high tech age and seem to have the ability to create all sorts of platforms, so we should be able to help moderate them via AI and similar.	In today's world where technology has advanced to such a degree, I'm of the belief that creating parameters that protect individuals from any form of hate speech is very much possible through things such as AI. The removing of commenting sections could be argued as a violation to one's freedom of speech, it also means the views and opinions of the public will be lost which could have detrimental effects.
__label__Attack	It's important to allow people to provide their own commentary	Many people are against the reducing of hate speech from newspaper article, and I am with them on this. The main reason for putting comment section on newspaper websites was for readers to leave a comment, people will always have something to say whether it is good or bad. But AI can still be used to remove comments that can be severely harmful.
__label__Attack	Negativity	Readers should not be given a false assumption on the understandings of others.
__label__Support	I think this is very important. Hate speech will drive away advertisers as they will not want to be associated with hateful comments. Newspapers will have to stop those comments to retain revenue. Facebook has started to process and it is about time other media outlets follow. https://www.facebook.com/community/whats-new/new-tools-features-nurture-community/	It has been shown that comments sections are popular and do drive traffic to websites and make people spend more time on the site (so pleasing advertisers) So from a commercial/publishing point of view it would seem that some kind of moderation is the best way to deal with the problem and not eliminate the section altogether. (See https://webpublisherpro.com/your-website-needs-a-comments-section/)
__label__Attack	I agree, this is a very measured resoonse.	Freedom of speech can be used as catch-all term to justify the use and propagation of bigoted and hateful language. If we accept that some language is not acceptable due to it's clearly hateful nature then we have to acknowledge that some form of censorship of those particular instances has to occur. I would suggest that eliminating all such spaces from newspaper websites would have a massive detrimental effect on valid, non-bigoted, freedom of speech a cornerstone of western life. We don't ban all cars because some people speed dangerously, we monitor the roads and ban the bad drivers. I suggest that as long as readers comments are monitored continually they should remain.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	Time	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	I agree that we have to be very careful around censorship. Shutting commentary down because it doesn't fit your agenda or internal narrative can be very dangerous as it is a tool used by dictators.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.

__label__Attack	agree as it can sometimes be very harmful	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Under current laws, restauranters are responsible for hate speech among their diners, so I certainly think platform owners should be responsible for the presence of hate speech on their websites. Hate speech is a criminal offence, after all.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Hate speech is very different to valid criticism.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.

__label__Support	Compelling argument	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__Attack	Would this not limit freedom of speech then ? people wont truly speak their minds if its being filtered first. Moderators would be given too much power ?	Strict moderation of comments prior to them being published may be the only way to limit hate speech on comments sections.
__label__Attack	I agree and as stated in this article (https://www.impactplus.com/blog/no-comment-why-companies-continue-to-move-away-from-comment-sections-on-their-website) it is possible to see that some websites actually already deleted the comment sections. They turned out to be quite useless as mostly trolls were commenting, while no interesting discussions were there anymore.	Proper moderation by the website owner should be required, whether using human moderators or using technology to flag potential hate speech for human review and action.
__label__Support	I agree. It's also a good way to give a second chance to a person in order for them to change their behavior. And maybe help them understand that they are writing hateful thing, and educating them in a sense.	I would not eliminate the hate speech right away but rather alarm the user and ask them to refrain from that kind of speech or ask them to elaborate or explain the reasons for the anger. Maybe as a moderator I would try to understand their viewpoint because by removing the speech there will be just more anger and hatred.

__label__Support	This is true, moreover as it is said in this article https://medium.com/@flytedesk/the-pros-and-cons-of-removing-a-website-comment-section-9bea62f8e42b, removing a comment section might be thought by some users as a going against free speech and they will also spend less time on the website, leading to worse performances of the brand/website.	Removing the comment section should not be an option, we should not lose the right to freedom of speech based on the likelihood that a few may post hateful comments, strict moderation and being able to report hate speech is the solution. Having people sign up for platforms and use ID to which they could be held personally accountable is an option as well. Hate Speech often comes from being able to hide behind a keyboard, screen and a fake username.

__label__Support	I think that people should be given the opportunity to have free speech but with people who are paid to moderate comments. Free speech should also include people being given the opportunity to say things others do not agree with as long as it is not promoting a violent crime to be committed against someone.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

Keep opinions to social media and let people thrash it out there.

__label__Support	I think people take comments sections with a pinch of salt - they aren't creating fake news, they're often just expressing opinions, providing context or simply having fun.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words.

I agree with some other opinions on the use of A1 to flag or censor certain words that constitute hate or violent speech. It would also be beneficial to have a human supervisor from the organisation and another external body review the activities of the AI to ensure accuracy and consistency.
__label__Attack	Why do people read comment sections? To get informed and enlightened or because they are nosy and killing time? I think most of the time is the latter. I am not sure the comments expressed at the bottom of a page bring more value to the conversation than they bring potential offence, hatred and fights started just for the fun of it.	I don't think removing the comment section reduces hate speech per se, it just pushes it elsewhere. I can't help feeling this sort of censorship is an infringement on free speech.
__label__Attack	You're trusting an algorithm that would need to be trained by humans - so the AI itself could still be biased.	By moderating the comment section.

It encourages people to read about the topic before making comments and peopel can easily reference reference the article in their comments. I think this allows for a more fruitful and productive discussion that on other platforms e.g. social media. However, hate speech is certainly an issue and easily derails conversations. While moderation of hate speech would be ideal, the burden on the newspaper is likely too great to do this manually.

__label__Support	This is a good idea, as it eliminates the need for a moderator to sift through every single comment but rather they only need to look through comments that have triggered the bot. Then, they can make a decision on whether it has truly conveyed hate speech or whether (less likely scenario) there is human/bot error in the process	we could use bots the get triggered when certain words are used. The bot will therefore remove the comment andhold it until it has mannually reviewed by a human. Another option can be to allow the users to report comments from other users and if the reports reach a certain threshold then hold that comment for review.

__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, feelings should be left out when giving your views.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform.

__label__Support	I agree	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	Think it may reduce misinformation from the newspapers if they are held accountable for what they say and the public dispute these given facts if they are not entirely correct	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	However it might not stop some people as they could believe that their opinion is correct and not hate.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	I can understand the reason why that might remove some of the problem, but that argument is a bit like saying, some roads frequently experience traffic jams, so let's get rid of all the cars. What's more important is the effective moderation of hate speech - and also crucially to call out mistruths. Discussions are the starting point.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	Absolutely correct. The important thing is to identify what hate speech actually means, because what is offensive to one individual might not be to another.	In order for effective moderation to occur, some kind of consensus or clearly reachable policy on what constitutes hate speech (including dogwhistling, which may be less clear to a lay viewer) would need to be in place. This might require too much buy-in from commenters, but is necessary if anything can be consistently enforced.
__label__Support	I do agree that comments shouldn't be closed.	Moderation is necessary. Closing comments is not the answer, as communication can help people to understand each other's viewpoints. If you take comments away because you're afraid of hate speech, you're going to be creating a barrier between you and your audience.
__label__Support	Agreed, more understanding and education are always good for society. Moderation functions as a good intermediary for discussion.	To ensure freedom of speech is still maintained, moderation needs to be carried out fairly. To achieve this, we need to understand what is hate speech and what are the lines that seperate that with constructive criticism. Attached is an article by the Standford encyclopedia of physiosphy regarding hate speech. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hate-speech/
__label__Support	Heavy moderation by the newspapers could prevent people being able to post their opinions	I think it'll be hard to do so, because everyone has the right to freedom of speech, but unless the comments brings acts of violence on people then it must be deleted
__label__Attack	Discriminatory words could be automatically blocked which will certainly reduce hate speech to some extent	I think it'll be hard to do so, because everyone has the right to freedom of speech, but unless the comments brings acts of violence on people then it must be deleted
__label__Attack	However, there are often ways to get around automatic moderation, and manually completed moderation would use a large amount of man hours and money	I think through fair moderation, then the amount of hate speech will be reduced.
__label__Support	Yep, this is the way.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	The issue at hand is not the total elimination of hate speech, but whether it can be reduced on newspaper websites. A newspaper must responsibly manage its public platform, and giving platform to hate speech is a problem it can manage. A newspaper is, by definition, not a forum.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes.

While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	Newspapers operate under their own distinct ownership and can thus set their own policies. Stores have their own methods of queuing for product, concert venues have their own methods of admitting attendees. Sites have no obligation to allow unsupervised public discourse.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	It is their responsibility though because if someone feels unsafe on their platform due to hate commentary then they lose customers and in some eyes may endorse hate speech by not doing anything to address it or try and filter it.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Support	This makes a good point. I think people should have freedome of speech but I also do think websites need to monitor comments.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Support	I think moderators are essential for this job to ensure standards are maintained. For some people comment boards and threads may be their only available way to have their opinion heard. However that shouldn't allow for hate speech to be publicly viewed.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	Some people may set up fake details / profiles in order to still post the hateful comments.

__label__Support	You can't censor everybody because of the behaviour of the few. Better to deal with the keyboard warriors individually	It is a tricky one to get the balance correct.

At the same time, there will also be people who wish to share their more sensible and respectful views on topics.

I think hate speech is always going to be a problem unfortunately, and although websites can monitor comments and remove any hate speech what ultimately is needed is teaching people there are better ways to get their opinions across and better use of freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Education to try and find the root causes as to why the specific hate speech is rooted in some peoples minds	freedom speech is good but it assumes that common sense prevails too
__label__Support	Saves having a human moderator soft through hundreds of comments.	The only possible way to reduce hate speech is to have some kind of algorithm that may recognise certain words and phrases. Other than that it would mean moderating the comment section.

__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.

Poeple need to be held accountable for their mistakes, so everybody else's rights will be protected. So having a set of keywords which are not allowed to be used is a way of reminding the writter that using the offensive word he/she is trying to use is considered a crime. An additional way to handle that is having the flag option by users and a team of moderators who follow a standard and will verify if flagged comments should be maintained or not. Lastly, anonymity might bring a feeling of impunity and even its possibility, so a way to avoid that is allowing one profile per person/email, where a fake username can be set, but, in the backstage, the website will know who it is that wrote each comment.

__label__Support	Passing hateful speeches is not basic right of freedom of speech, rather you are checking how peoples comment could affect society. People need to be banned and removed from passing those comments to put positive energy on media platforms.	If we are to ban everyone who post a hateful comment we would be infringing on their basic right of freedom of speech.

Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__Support	I agree. Just moderate the comment sections a bit more.	If the aim is merely to reduce hate speech then I think eradicating the comment section goes too far. Why should people not be allowed to comment and have their say. The newspaper is punishing the public for the crimes of a few. It seems rather unfair. I think the best method is to have monitors.

In everyday life you could go months and if not years without hearing hate speech, whilst it can almost be a daily occurrence when browsing online in various forums, social media platforms or comment sections on news websites.

__label__Attack	I dont believe in censorship though. Commentary and opinions are important.

__label__Support	I agree	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Attack	There’s a psychological effect where being presented with information, even in the context of given facts of“this is wrong and inaccurate” actually reinforces the belief in that information if you already made up your mind on the issue.

Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others.

Having moderators or AI to automatically remove content that includes keywords with cursing or inflammatory language, having a report/flag button so people can report and remove very offensive things
__label__Attack	I disagree, the person commenting can do so in a manner that isn't hateful. Only people who choose hate as their platform in getting their opinion across will be blocked. Hopefully these people rethink their approach and try again in a different manner	By flagging certain vocabulary which relates to hate speech and once this is flogged, the person commenting is blocked from posting their view. We would need to look at ways of getting around mispellings of the words though, as people could use this to get past the AI.
__label__Attack	The biggest problem that there is	I'm a firm supporter of freedom of speech but the internet as we all know can be a cruel place. A lot of individuals hide behind their screens and say things to people that they wouldn't have the guts to say in person given the opportunity. So with that being said I stand for the elimination of the space bar for readers.
__label__Attack	The problem is that hate speech laws differ from country to country. The UN has a set of rules (https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech?gclid=Cj0KCQjw48OaBhDWARIsAMd966B8prXQ12vsyA9iPNzeoJiBpSFAuLJFh4j4_h5QJe48gd8MVKZ4eHQaAiPWEALw_wcB) but that does not mean all countries obey and follow them. Taking away opinion from topics would mean you would not know how other feel about an topic or article all in the name of hate speech. Therefore, it would create a miss understood society.

__label__Attack	You can reduce hate speech in the comment section by flagging certain vocabulary which directly relates to hate speech, which then will automatically block the comment and therefore cannot be posted.

__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.

It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__Support	Absolutely. I think there is a thin line between disallowing free speech and blocking what others may see as hate speech. The trick is finding a balance between the two. The newspaper must avoid being seen as blocking views that may differ with them.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem

Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	This could be costly depending on how many articles there are to review	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__Support	Seems a cost efficient way.	It can be done by using algorithms
__label__Support	I feel like this would be the mos t ideal solution.	I think there should be red flagged or blacklisted words that shouldn't be allowed to be used in reader's comments. If a certain post contain such words, it should not be automatically exposed to other readers but should be reviewed first by the admin to check if it meets the standard before being exposed to everyone.
__label__Support	I agree!	One mainstream way of mitigating hate speech on online comment sections is to pre-moderate comments. This however may lead to a 'biased' viewpoint. A lighter example of this could be how some youtubers delete constructive criticism.

With rights comes responsibility. We all have freedom of speech but it is our responsibility to ensure that our speech does not cause harm on others.

__label__Attack	Whilst I agree that the platforms should be responsible, with the vast numbers of people contributing to some platforms it is virtually impossible to moderate every single comment.	Holding platforms responsible for all content they publish would help
__label__Attack	No hiding behind false ID	I think that the idea of users submitting personal data before making a comment can have positive and negative effects - positive in the sense that the user may think twice before posting hate speech and that they can be tracked down and educated; negative in the sense that the user could be on a website that wants to use user's personal data for the wrong reasons. I am still of the view that comments with hate speech need to be filtered out because each individual needs to be responsible in their speech.
__label__Support	I also believe that educating one another is very important in trying to reduce hate speech.	There is no cure for hate speech, but there is a way to stand up against it. Speak out against hate speech - fight racism and bigotry with love, empathy, compassion, and strength. We may not be able to eliminate hatred entirely, but the more steps we can take to educate and support human beings, and speak out against injustice, the better this world will become.

__label__Attack	Free speech should be entouraged but newspapers should have more responsibility to moderate	Despite our general right to freedom of speech, hate speech remains inextricably linked to hate crimes and intolerance. A hard stance should be taken by newspapers against hate speech, utilising moderators to remove hateful comments, despite the fact that it could be construed as a restriction on free speech.
__label__Attack	I agree that it is impossible for a human moderator to read every comment and react quick enough to an offensive comment before it has been read by other commentators.	Despite my defence of human moderators, it seems they too are flawed -- check out this article https://www.technologynetworks.com/informatics/news/ai-trusted-as-much-as-humans-to-flag-hate-speech-365777 -- human moderators are not only prone to bias but also impractical. With the huge wealth of content posted every second online, it is unrealistic to expect humans to be able to view, criticise, and moderate every single comment.
__label__Support	It would have the advantage of searching out offensive words prior to them actually being printed and could be stopped before they are.	By utilising AI so that it can look for certain words that could be deemed offensive.

__label__Attack	People can have constructive debates and confront serious issues without using hate speech. Filtering hate speech will not stop debates.	At the end of the day hate speech is not hate speech to everyone, I ended up reaching the conclusion that everyone has their own opinion about everything, So to want to filter or block comments is not freedom of speech, but building a sensitive society that is scared of debates and confronting serious issues, Its up to the receiver of the comment to act on it or not. Cyber bullying is a different story.
__label__Attack	I disagree. Removing the comments section is limiting access to echo chambers, quite literally.	The vast majority of digital news consumers - that is 76% in America, read comments sections. This means by removing them were missing a big chance at limiting the harmful effects of echo chambers and encouraging consumers to think critically and question things
__label__Attack	Even with human moderators it still comes down to personal preference. There is no person alive who doesn't have ANY biases. what one human moderator might deem acceptable language another might not. Therefore, even human moderation isn't 100% accurate and failsafe.	There should be automatic filters but they are not 100, so there should also be a team of people constanly monitoring and reviewing complaints and reports. I feel like it is the only way to keep the freedom of speech but also protect people who might be victims of it.

__label__Support	I agree	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Support	Perhaps this would put too much power in the hands of arbiters. But if those who partake in submitting 'hate' comments were to be traced, they should end up in the Courts, not be 'educated'.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__Attack	if one matter is not given enough attention than that would have bad consequences as if might not reach a lot of people	Reducing hate speech shouldn't be the focus. The problem lies in the reactions to it - in particular, giving the drastic perspectives too much attention. This attention only encourages more of the debate and problematic perspectives. Though total ignorance would also be unfair, so really we need a position of just LESS attention and care given to such perspectives.
__label__Attack	Realistically this would probably work, but it would no doubt still have problems like people raising issues of 'suppressing free speech' etc.	i think one of the best ways is to allow everyone a free space of commenting yet making sure that all the hate speech is automatically blocked no one can see those comments except the administrator
__label__Support	I agree it really is up to the publisher to include comments. I don't believe that not allowing a platform will reduce hate speech.	State that the editor is free to print or not print any comments, and his/hers is the final decision.

__label__Support	However it's more likely that enough people will visit a website, and that there will be enough diverse opinions that the extreme ones (those looking for the argument and attention even) won't have to be given emphasis. So yes, I think your idea works well.	Control what is printed or posted to make sure that it is diverse and does not contain any hate speech but the message they are trying to get across they are able to. That way newspaper can leave the comment section and different opinions are heard and expressed and no one gets hurt.
__label__Support	This works if the media had some guidelines to go by, otherwise everyone's level of what would be allowed would be different.	the fairly way of reducing hate speech from newspapers website is not allowing anyone to comment that is to bloc the comment section.
__label__Attack	This sounds easy enough to implement however it begs the question as to why it has not been done already does it not?	create a team of people that can look for and remove the hate speech and leave all other respectful arguments to make the comment section diverse.
__label__Support	The media should not be in control of what we view, though. And I can see the side of your thinking. Perhaps with the option to view said removed comments makes this more plausible for you? I wonder how that changes your opinion, if at all of course.	The idea that media should be able to stop a conversation is wrong and this is what would happen if comments were removed.

__label__Support	All very good and valid points, i am in total agreement with PriceP. Very well put.	I think the first step to reducing hate speech in readers comments should be in the form of a moderation team in which they filter inappropriate comments. I think it should be a group of people rather than AI to do this to ensure all hate speech within a variety of contexts are eliminated, as if this was done by a computer there is risk of hate spilling through. For example, hate speech on the social media platform Twitter can often be missed as users purposefully misspell hateful speech to ensure it does not flag up on the AI searches, going as far as hateful language misspelt actually trending on Twitter.
__label__Attack	This is a horribly uninformed and unnecessarily inflammatory opinion, EmilyN. Are you saying that people who want to target, insult, and threaten others should be more protected that the people who are being threatened (i.e. the victims)? Just food for thought.	I think newspapers should not take away the comment section. Firstly this is unfair to all the people who want to have their say and should be able to do so Dominicis wrong
__label__Attack	I don't think we should rely on AI or algorithms to safeguard comment sections. Algorithms are only as reliable as the coding, and that is done in total darkness.	In summary, I think we should not remove comment sections. We need to "teach" AI to filter the comment section on newspaper websites. In that way, we can add or remove filters, and AI will simply do the work of making sure the comment section is appropriate. People should not get involved to directly filter comments, they may not be fair at all.
__label__Attack	It would require more time and effort	I think we could have a hold on comments until it is checked and fact checked by a panel of people! Not just one person making the decision. Also I think if there were stricter punishments for hate speech the newspaper would make the person and newspaper think twice.

This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

__label__Support	Thank you! Some hate is seriously not necessary	ALthough the idea of free speech is important, it cannot be used as an excuse to upset others and use racist/sexist/ violent language.

__label__Attack	By total scrapping of the comment section, reporters might get away with misinforming the public therefore they need to be called out right on the spot but in a respectful manner.	Removing the comment section all together is a fair point as news is meant to be fair and impartial. People share their opinions based on their biases and that's not what the news is for - that's what social media is for. But in this case allowing the comment section to remain would be great if people would not abuse the power to share freely by sharing hate speech and slander. us as humans need to be regulated by a set of rules in order to keep a functioning society and i think a filtered comment section is the solution.
__label__Attack	Freedom of speech and thought are both really important and allow people to sometimes 'clear' their minds of thoughts.	I found this really interesting, "Khan said the freedom of opinion and expression, including the right to seek, receive and disseminate diverse sources of information, must be upheld by States in times of crises and armed conflict as a precious ‘survival right’ on which people’s lives, health, safety, security and dignity depend." This is similar to what lots of people have been saying regarding worrying that this sort of censorhip could overextend.

While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	I think it would just become full of comments from people who were writing things just to get a reaction - feeding the trolls!	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry.

Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	I agree the comment section is for everyone- but what else can we do. Evidence has shown that hate speech can lead to real life crimes, and that needs to be tackled.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Support	I agree. However, policies that educate people on how to deliver their speech is imperative	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Support	I also agree because reading what people thinks about your work or your outlet is important. if not then how could the writer improve?	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

__label__Attack	To read a persons message would be an invasion of privacy	I think one way to reduce hate speech online would be monitoring the message.

If someone writes a message, it should be checked before allowing it to be posted, it could be done by a simple program where the computer looks for offensive words.
__label__Attack	It could take a long time for them to be reviewed, leaving the conversation no longer relevant.	I think if all comments go under review for hate speech, that should still allow a chance for hate speech comments to be retracted
__label__Support	This can hinder the increase of hate speech by filtering out the hate words	I think this is a task that is hard to do because it has to be done in a way that would not hinder freedom of speech but at the same time not attack people. Thus, I think comments should be flagged depending on the words used but not be deleted until it has been checked.
__label__Support	It can be fooled by the writing of the bad word, like in some social media.	I think this is a task that is hard to do because it has to be done in a way that would not hinder freedom of speech but at the same time not attack people. Thus, I think comments should be flagged depending on the words used but not be deleted until it has been checked.
__label__Support	Thats a reasonable idea however, there needs to updates that automatically flag out inappropriate comments	Having a screaning for all comments before they go up on the platform to make sure that they are not posted on the site.
__label__Attack	I think that removing the comment section on specific topics is important	Removing the comment section from online newspapers is not the answer. Allowing people to post their opinions is healthy and a normal part of human society- people will not always agree. However, in order to reduce hate speech, which can so often lead to crime, it could be done so that there are monitors (either human or computer) who check comments before they are posted to ensure they are not hate speech.
__label__Attack	Possible infringment on data	After doing some follow up reading from https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/what-is-online-hate-crime/ I have seen how the anonymity of these online comments can be what makes it so easy for people to be hateful. Therefore, an easy solution would be to make it impossible for people to comment anonymously, and have people have to provide personal information. However, I am not sure how this would work from a data protection point of view. It is certainly a start.
__label__Support	basing it on the public opinion is better.

__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes.

While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it.

__label__Support	This is a fair point -- maybe removing the influence of comment sections altogether will stop the trend of news increasingly becoming 'comment' and being less objective in reporting.

__label__Support	I firmly agree. Comment sections need to be regulated not banned. Rules need to be put in place on what will be considered as hate speech with that,the consequences of part taking in the said hate speech.	We should have a clear definition for hate speech in order to regulate the comment section. For example, comments suggesting certain groups be harmed or should not exist, and language that suggests these groups are inferior without providing educational evidence. We need to keep the comment section a place of discussion and education.
__label__Attack	People will speak what is on their mind	There is no discussion on free speech to have : free speech is absolute or not. If you don't like free speech then go live in China.

__label__Attack	This argument doesn't consider the ways in which certain kinds of speech can suppress other kinds of free speech.

__label__Attack	not well explained	The pros of removing comment sections would be to eradicate the spreadof hate speech. Certain individuals thrive on adding fuel to fire. In this case having the comment section deleted would be a positive thing. On the other hand only by having differing opinions can discussions and debates happen. So if someone spews hate speech only then can we see the extent to which someone disagrees with a certain group/viewpoint etc. https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea
__label__Attack	Tasking whole units with not only moderation of hate speech but also tracking it and analysing it for trends is a huge additional workload for an already stretched sector. It sounds great, but likely unrealistic in terms of newspaper resources.	The newspapers should encourage the victims of hate speech to report hate speech published, establish monitoring and evaluation units in newsrooms. Some units should be tasked with monitoring hate speech trends, compiling reports and bringing these to the attention of key institutions
__label__Support	Gathering data in a specific area of online discussion like newspaper comment sections would probably reveal a lot about how online discourse turns to hate speech and how to tackle it as a problem. Maybe this task could be given to an independent or charitable institution, with the newspapers' cooperation?	The newspapers should encourage the victims of hate speech to report hate speech published, establish monitoring and evaluation units in newsrooms.

__label__Attack	Will still allow some comments which could be seen as offensive	Regulations of comment sections has been proven with various other platforms to be the best solution.

A ban from the being able to comment for a certain period of time.

__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	agree with this totally, and I think that was my opinion earlier	I think the best way to reduce hate speech in newspaper websites is to ensure that the site can detect words and phrases that can be considered hate speech, and block them from being posted on the comment section. Also, a moderator to approve each comment section before it becomes publicly accessible is a notion which can be adopted as well.
__label__Support	I think an AI could be very useful as well because it would take emotion out of equation when reaching decisions about what speech should be weeded out.	We do have to allow people to express their opinions - we can't pretend opinions don't exist. Having them out in the open lets us know what we're dealing with. But at the same time hate speech can't be allowed to flourish and absolutely needs to be challenged. There is a role for AI (which I have said before I know) to try and weed out and remove anything that is just pure hate and not any sort of coherent argument or opinion.
__label__Support	Implementing these can have a favourable outcome.	In as much as we can not let the spread of hate speech continue, closing the comment section is not the solution. The newspaper website should have the option for readers to be able to report comments that include hate speech and moderators should be appointed to check "users" that are violating the rules. There can be filters in place that remove posts that have some of the common hateful and derogatory phrases. outlining the rules and regulations for the website users can help

__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks.

__label__Attack	I disagree, people know the damage but do not care. They hide behind relative anonymity and so do not worry about what people think of their posts.

__label__Support	I agree with the issue of fake news. Readers can find it very difficult to ascertain what is fact and what is fiction online.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Attack	I think it's difficult to re-educate (so to speak) someone engaging in Hate Speech because the root cause is something within themselves. Unless a newspaper website wanted to fund a dedicated team to address and re-program the life long beliefs and internalised trauma that some racists, homophobes etc hold, then it seems an insurmountable task. The key would be to start at the ground floor and provide affordable therapy, mandatory counselling for offenders, pump more money into diversifying and fortifying the education system...	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__Attack	I think they hold some responsibility. But perhaps not in the way this survey is trying to determine. A free flow of ideas is necessary, which includes difficult and often cantankerous and vigorous differing opinions. It should be the responsibility of said sites to allow those types of opinions, but deal with the trolls that free and open debate often attract.	Is it actually their responsibilty?
__label__Support	But that is not the question.	Hate speech is everywhere, not just in the newspaper
__label__Attack	Who gets to determine what exactly IS hate speech? It's a slippery slope that eventual will deem everything hate speech.	Hate speech is everywhere, not just in the newspaper
__label__Support	This is a good argument, instead of trying to stop free speech altogether rather look to filter out specifically hate speech.	Maybe AI could filter hate speech
__label__Support	Do not stop free speech, filter out hate speech!	According to newsy.com, between January and March 2022, Meta took action on more than 15 million pieces of hate speech content on Facebook.

__label__Attack	I think it's a little more nuanced than curtailing freedom of speech.

People will create a space for their commentary if there isn't one provided (or if their comments are removed from somewhere). A lot of this comes down to what a given newspaper wants to be associated with (in the sense of their brand) as opposed to maintaining the sanctity of online discussion.
__label__Attack	My concern is that comments could be flagged as inappropriate in bad faith e.g. to shut down the opinions of those people disagree with even if the comments are not inappropriate or hateful	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.

__label__Attack	There is clear evidence of the efficacy of different moderation practices because these have been used on various sites for years now.

__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.

The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__Attack	I believe that most people actually do realize the damage that hate speech can cause and are either deliberately using a platform to incite violence/harm/distress or just don't care as they dont see the people they are using hate speech against as being worth feeling for. There is enough research now to show the direct links between hate speech and hate crimes	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Support	Absolutely true. Everyone has freedom of speech. We live in a democratic country where everyone have the right to speak and all voices need to be heard. It is up to the individual to make sure that they put forward their points without being too aggressive and not getting carried away.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Support	I agree	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I completely agree that education should be involved. The issue is that this doesn't have immediate affects and therefore this is why moderating the comment sections combined with education is key.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	Removes possibility to have conversations which help move us forward	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	I agree! This is truly the best solution out there at this point and time. It is scientifically proven that one is more careful about how one expresses one's feelings when he knows he is not under anonymity.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If newspaper columnists can publish their opinions, why can't the public enjoy the same freedoms?	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	Removing the comment section will not prevent hate speech from occurring. People will find an alternative online platform, e.g. forums. Instead, companies should focus on moderating the comment section/providing links as to why posts that may be flagged are harmful. We need to focus more on prevention as opposed to reaction.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	I agree that real time moderation	Better real-time monitoring of posts, either by AI or human monitoring (or combination of both). Another way is to reuire ID to sign up so as each comment is linked to someone who can be identified. This would surely reduce the instances of hate speech, and help catch those who take part in such hate speech.
__label__Support	I totally agree!	I believe that with real time moderation , if the comments can be removed before causing any distress to people then this is a better option than removing the ability to make comments.
__label__Support	It is absolutely true!	I believe that with real time moderation , if the comments can be removed before causing any distress to people then this is a better option than removing the ability to make comments.
__label__Support	I agree that providing ID could be a way to help with this.	I think that only people who provided identifying information can post their opinions. Also I agree that there should be AL tools to prevent hate speech. Eliminating hate speech from newspaper websites has nothing to do with the infringement of the free speech right.
__label__Support	The comment space gives users a way to vent out their frustration. It is not always nice to see derogatory language but when there is a healthy discussion, it helps people reading them to find very informative.	I think we need to develop a way to recognize hate speech in comments so that it is easy to monitor comment sections for derogatory and offensive language. There are studies on how to go about this for example if you follow this link it talks about "A Feature-Based Approach to Assess Hate Speech in User Comments" https://www.cairn.info/revue-questions-de-communication-2020-2-page-529.htm
__label__Support	I agree. Accountability is extremly important for public confidence, so very important that this happens	As I saw some commentary on this platform, my opinion is that we need 2 things. A submission of personal data before one can have access to post anything related and real time moderation of the comments. Big platforms like YouTube, Instagram and others are held accountable for their users' actions and they have had a lot of success so far.

__label__Attack	I think using personal data would be tricky.

__label__Support	Absolutely! With the current developments in technology we have enough tools to reduce hate speech without eliminating space for readers comments.	Registering with ID is the single step that would improve incidences of hate speech in comments section. That coupled with live moderation either by AI or human, and following rules that can quickly adapt to change should greatly rduce hate speech.
__label__Support	I totally agree with this idea, this would still allow for comments on newspaper websites while at the same time addressing the issue of online hate speech.	Newspapers should have an algorithm that catches certain words or phrases which are hateful in nature. These words will be automatically flagged up and accounts that are flagged x amount of times should then be restricted from commenting for a period of time. If after this period, they continue to try and post comments with hateful content, they should be banned entirely from commenting.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.

__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way.

__label__Attack	Simply using a word filter would not be enough.

Anyway, I do think people having verified accounts might help. Need to stop the "anonymous" profiles - the coward's castle types.

__label__Attack	This still poses an issue with what people think is acceptable. You run the risk of people joining in as opposed to call it out.	Having read all of the previous discussion surrounding this debate, I still stand by my original opinion. Moderating comments by an official representative of the newspaper doesn't allow for free speech. We do however, need to eliminate hate speech. I think the best way to do this is to put this in the hands of the community and other readers.
__label__Support	Supporting evidence, since the 'fetch args' button is refusing to attach it: https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=Social%20Networks%20as%20the%20New%20Frontier%20of%20Terrorism	Unfortunately, the public's view on acts of terrorism (including domestic) can be strongly swayed by the effective use of such innocent feeling things as comment sections, as these groups may flood such sections underneath reporting of their own acts with sympathetic or 'this isn't an issue' type posts, thus influencing others' opinions directly or indirectly.

__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes.

The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__noRel	Yes, another way to only limit hate speech is to remove anonymity. Therefore, certain sites can require those to sign-up with their bio and this is verified by moderators. Someone may think twice about being 'hateful' if there are repercussions.	Computers should be able to detect hate speech if there is any and report and remove that comment whinin minutes of posting it
__label__noRel	Problem being, who gets to decide what hate speech actually is? It's all very well claiming hate speech at the drop of at hat but often it may be perceived as escalationary and over reactivity particularly to the level of juvenilty online discussion sometimes goes. I mean fine the web site providers are free to use their own discernment and reasonably can determine what does or doesn't feature on their website but that is not really conducive to cultivation an active user base.	Discussion can be encouraged, but so often it leads to hate speech / one sided arguments. There needs to be a moderator in place to delete / hide certain comments, so free speech is allowed, but hate speech is not.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	Comment sections need to be well-moderated, and if algoritmic or user comment flagging is used this needs to also be reviewed by a human moderator to ensure that there is no bias or bad faith reporting going on.
__label__noRel	I think this is an invasion of privacy and the internet allows people to be the person they want to be and want to identify as - something they might not feel comfortable doing in real life.

__label__noRel	if No more trolls, political copy-pastes, or general rudeness and anger are in comments i think both sides of arguement/opinion can be heard.	Hate speech blocking should not be implemented, people must learn to take some criticism in a positive way, it can be helpful.

Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	Have them reviewed after they are posted and do not allow them to be viewed before they are revied, as well as keeping tabs on the user posting the comments.
__label__noRel	I think this is a good idea, but people have a way of getting around these filters by using different fonts or characters that cannot be read by the filter bots.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	These comments are on their sites and it is their responsibility to control them. Some comments may be discriminating and therefore do not belong on the site	Could ensure moderation of commonly used words for hate speech, and frequent moderation on these websites
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	Should be reviewed first before it gets published
__label__noRel	but what if users arent using their real information, how can the goverment implement it then?	most people seem to be of the opinion that cutting comments altogether is not constructive. A good point was made by an individual that viewing opinions from people you like only doesn't help you to grow (echo chamber).
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	Commenters should agree to abide by all rules when signing up to the website and he banned for breaking the rules. Also all submitted comments must be thoroughly checked for negative for flagged words or topics. Also I think it would reduce the chances of this happening if users could not reply to each other or comment on others opinions. It's about each users initial opinion on a certain subject and less about judging others opinions on what they think!!!!
__label__noRel	Absolutely - and it is essential that these behaviours are addressed through better education on diversity and inclusivity.	Debate should be available upon all topics. To reduce this availability reduces the opportunities for people to express their opinions and undermines democratic processes. Hate speech should be managed and eliminated before publication.
__label__noRel	IT is absoluety the websites job to police polirising comments if nesccearry to keep peace wihthin the outiside community viewing their newspapers.	https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons

__label__noRel	If they are allowed to make their comments through other channels of communication then I agree.	More emphasis on moderation of specific language would reduce the risk of hate speech. Also, moderators approving comments before they appear on the website would help.
__label__noRel	Firtly, i think the newpaper need to acknowledge the concern of hate speech. And is importnant because we can never fully avoid it. So the newspaper should have a platform support people who are targets of hate speech.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	Ai could be used to flag, but then an experienced arbitrator is needed to decide if item removed	By simply educating people about what harm hate speech can do to a person
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	hate speech revolves around certain words or slurs so if those word can be banned or even not allowed and the comment does not show up on the actual site it will help curb hate speech
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	"Freedom of Speech'...that's a popular consensus among the masses, regardless of the "casualities" that are left on the wayside. Having reread a lot of the comments posted here, I do consider the possibility of having people comment as they wish, politically correct or not. HOWEVER, let there be consequences involved, such as naming and shaming, and acquring user details if need be, after all, things such as cyber crime, online harrassment, etc do exist, am I right? And so, if such a comment borders on this, let it become a criminal matter and have law enforcement dealing specifically in cyber-related crimes become involved. Problem solved.
__label__noRel	How is this going to stop trolls that create multiple accounts so that if they are blocked they just do it from another faceless account consequences.l	But education and training and awareness are also needed, so people don't repeat what mistakes they have done in the past.
__label__noRel	Making the rules up front is definitely a good idea and I agree that the comments need to be moderated in order to enforce those rules.	There can be a filtering system that filters hate speech
__label__noRel	then where can conversations happen which might help people expand their positions?	The use of admins and moderators can be helpful in removing hate speech. They would need strict rules for the public in order to not let their own personal biases judge what is and isn't considered hate speech.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Allow users to report comments.
__label__noRel	Hate speech is a probelm, and to discredit any potential help is not the answer. Trials and attempts could be made to fix this issue. A good way to do so would be to use human modetors who are netural, to ensure that there is fairness.	I think that the introduction of moderators to remove any hate speech would be beneficial. Perhaps the introduction of guidelines as to what constitutes permitted negative comments.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	Using moderators, educating users, calling out trolls and haters!
__label__noRel	I disagree. Would you like to read a newspaper filled with hate speech just because they are not in charge of identifying what is hate speech or not?	There is no need to reduce hate speech, we just need to accept it. Banning or reducing hate speech is just censorship which is not acceptable.
__label__noRel	As a moderator in other capacities, I can tell you it takes a lot of time to manually review every single comment as they come in.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Hate speech is not free speech. It must be banned
__label__noRel	I agree, Article 19 of the ICCPR guarantees the right to freedom of expression but also disallows discrimination. Restricting any sort of speech violates the right to freedom of expression and can be utilised by leadership or publications to discriminate. https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/international-covenant-civil-and-political-rights	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	Compelling argument	newspapers should not have a comments section.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	newspapers are unlikely to policy it as no publicity is bad publicity to them. the more engagements they get, the better.
__label__noRel	I disagree, comment sections allow the public to engage with the news and find people similar to them	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	It is nice to read things you agree with, and proabaly helps sell newspapers	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	Only People from certain age should be allowed to comment
__label__noRel	moderator could remove the part of sentence and not the whole post instead, so that the entire post is not unreadable, the person could have a valid point, just not written it in a better way,	This is not a black or white topic. The question is how exactly we define hate speech. Criticism in itself is not hate speech, but it is easy to take things to extremes, especially when someone expresses their opinion anonymously. Education about the reasons is important to better understand our own feelings and behaviour. Educate people do not restrict them!
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	I agree blocking all comments blocks free speech	Perhaps newspapers could use similar tools to respondology (https://respondology.com/ ) or hive moderation (https://hivemoderation.com ) that can identify and block hateful speech. This might well work and I think both of these use AI.
__label__noRel	People are entitled to freedom of speech and shouldn't have their views taken away from them	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	Who gets to decide what qualifies as hate speech? If I criticize someone from a protected class for their own bad behavior, what's to stop them from shielding themselves from that criticism by claming it to be hate speech?	There need to be some kind of moderation, either before or after comments are published
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	Every person should be traceable, so they are accountable. If your comments consist of hate speech or are offensive then you be accounable.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Firstly, newspapers need to enact a proper system of moderation. Blocking all comments infringes on free speech and does not allow readers to provide a counterpoint to the position provided in the article.
__label__noRel	The idea of using AI algorithms to combat hate speech is an attractive one. However, using experience of Facebook, it's clear that AI systems are still not advanced enough to undertake this task without human oversight. Facebook often censors posts or comments unfairly because its AI algorithms doesn't understand the context. In short, I don't believe we can get away without using humans to check the flagged comments at least.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	Newspaper comment spaces allow people the opportunity to share their opinions and feel that they can contribute their thoughts and ideas - it can also help readers engage with the content in a different way.

The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I agree with this	i think by just censoring specific words that are hateful/derogatory this could then automically screen out hateful comments that are abusive - i think it should be judged on what would be an offense to say in person. This could then use humans to read and monitor comment boards and then train AI to further do so
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	I found this really interesting, "Khan said the freedom of opinion and expression, including the right to seek, receive and disseminate diverse sources of information, must be upheld by States in times of crises and armed conflict as a precious ‘survival right’ on which people’s lives, health, safety, security and dignity depend." This is similar to what lots of people have been saying regarding worrying that this sort of censorhip could overextend.

__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	Online comment spaces should be platforms promoting free speech, with some restrictions in place. Human or digital moderators (AI) could be used to identify comments and phrases constituting hate speech and remove them from the platform without hindering people's ability to share their authentic views.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	I do not think it is possible, in a fair and just way. When speech is restricted that's called censorship. Who would justify the restrictive opinion?
__label__noRel	This is very true and I think that by focusing on educating others before they decide to give an opinion as most hate speech is just a form of ignorance from others.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	AI would be a great tool in conjunction with other moderation measures but is not reliable enough to be used on its own.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	There needs to be a level of moderation before comments are posted. Comments that are harmful, false or misleading shouldn't be allowed to be put up, but there should still be room for healthy debate.
__label__noRel	I disagree with this because newspapers can lose readers due to poor interaction	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Eliminating the comments section won't stop hate speech: we have to work on the root of the problem	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Some newspapers already don't have comment sections on certain articles which they think would attract harmful comments or trolls.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	I think hate speech is always going to be a problem unfortunately, and although websites can monitor comments and remove any hate speech what ultimately is needed is teaching people there are better ways to get their opinions across and better use of freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	It has been shown that comments sections are popular and do drive traffic to websites and make people spend more time on the site (so pleasing advertisers) So from a commercial/publishing point of view it would seem that some kind of moderation is the best way to deal with the problem and not eliminate the section altogether.

__label__noRel	Recent congressional hearings have highlighted the chasm between Democrats and Republicans on the issue. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler convened a hearing in the aftermath of the New Zealand attack, saying the internet has aided white nationalism’s international proliferation. “The President’s rhetoric fans the flames with language that—whether intentional or not—may motivate and embolden white supremacist movements,” he said, a charge Republicans on the panel disputed. The Senate Judiciary Committee, led by Ted Cruz, held a nearly simultaneous hearing in which he alleged that major social media companies’ rules disproportionately censor conservative speech, threatening the platforms with federal regulation. Democrats on that panel said Republicans seek to weaken policies dealing with hate speech and disinformation that instead ought to be strengthened.	I think an AI that could identify some keyword related with hate speech would be helpful to flag that comment and allow further review
__label__noRel	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button	Comment sections need to be well-moderated, and if algoritmic or user comment flagging is used this needs to also be reviewed by a human moderator to ensure that there is no bias or bad faith reporting going on.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	Newspaper websites should use human or artificial intelligence-based moderators who can impartially identify hate speech and remove it from their platforms without removing or censoring genuine, constructive comments and perspectives. If AI is used, certain terms and phrases can be added to a database and comments containing them flagged for moderation to remove hate speech fairly.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry.

Like many I agree that some people are unaware they unaware they have caused offence to others.
__label__noRel	Agreed.

My position as a reader and my argument is that bases on the rules of speech people have freedom of speech and expression. That should be done in a proper way without insulting others or hating or being racist in your speech. Websites and newspapers should not remove the comments of the people responding to hate speech.

__label__noRel	I agree, this kind of moderation would be helpful	Hate speech must be banned totally from the online publications.

__label__noRel	I do agree with education and raising awareness but what about bots and people who simply want to cause trouble?	The comment section needs to be moderated using some kind of filter to automatically filter any words on the banned list and then use a report system to flag up anything which tries to bypass this. This will allow a human moderator to quickly decide what can be kept and what needs action.
__label__noRel	I don't think this is about negative and positive comments but limiting someones ability to spread hate speech.	you ca reduce hate speech by adding an ai bot that can distinguishly remove between violent words from a comment.

Even if you don't agree with the arguments there are ways of saying it that do not fall into 'hate speech'.
__label__noRel	I don't agree. There are too many people who shouldn't have access to the Internet. They hide behind their PC screens and writes a lot of things they would never dare to say in reality. They believe they can say everything that comes to their minds when they can hide behind a PC screen, and that lowers the quality in the comments section. And there are laws against racism and other topics than they can use as triggers.	I strongly feel that comments are an essential part of the readers experience. It assists readers by giving them a broader sense and understanding of the topic being discussed. Removing them would be taking a way an integral part of that experience.

__label__noRel	I think comments provide additional context and a barometer for the reception of the article. Removing comments completely would be a shame!	I think the first step to reducing hate speech in readers comments should be in the form of a moderation team in which they filter inappropriate comments. I think it should be a group of people rather than AI to do this to ensure all hate speech within a variety of contexts are eliminated, as if this was done by a computer there is risk of hate spilling through. For example, hate speech on the social media platform Twitter can often be missed as users purposefully misspell hateful speech to ensure it does not flag up on the AI searches, going as far as hateful language misspelt actually trending on Twitter.

__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	too many opinions can be conflicting	the comment section should be set in a way that filters certain words that promote hate speech
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	i guess you could pretend that everything is great	By moderating the comment section. Instead of having an individual who may be biased in their moderation, the use of an artificial intelligence software can be introduced to moderate the comment section.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	up to this point, moderators have done a poor job as evidenced by the amount of hate speech so maybe the answer is simply to remove the ability to comment.
__label__noRel	That's a brilliant idea. Certain words do NOT need to be used and if they are they should be reviewed just incase.	This is not just a newspaper comment section problem... it's a social media problem as well, more like an internet problem. We need way to not push people away, but educate them. Because the truth is, nobody starts out as a hater but radicaliz ation can happen to anyone. check https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P55t6eryY3g
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	Newspapers and free speech functioned well for a couple of hundred years without instant comments. People used to write letters to the newspaper, including their name. The newspaper would then publish some letters anonymously. This meant that people were protected but offered well considered opinions, rather than abusive or nasty comments. Perhaps a slower postal system encourages better behaviour rather than an amplified Twitter-esque school-yard of bullying and abuse.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	This is an interesting point - I wonder if some websites already use AI to moderate user comments and posts. I think AI could be trained to recognise hate speech, although it would have to be tested first as it could censor too much.
__label__noRel	Other comments can also make other people sad	There should be some level of censoring to eliminate hate speech, but not to the extent where comments are totally disabled
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	I think that a comment section is necessary for engagement and exchange of ideas but having said that, there should be a code for AI embedded within that platform which will be able to detect hate speech or words classified as hate speech then the AI can delete them automatically. Also people can report the comment and the AI should delete the comment within minutes of it being reported.
__label__noRel	other points of view should always be welcomed	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	yes. good moderators are the key	By educating people that not everything written in newspapers is true, they should egnore some information
__label__noRel	A hate speech detecting service as discussed in the following article could be the answer to this problem.https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-for-hate-speech-detection-a-large-scale-empirical-evaluation-92831ded6bb6	There should be people assigned to go over the comments provided in order to ensure that the final approved posts do not contain hate speech. Basically a team set up to censor comments accordingly
__label__noRel	I agree	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	This is probably the optimal solution, but it also requires a lot of work force and might be quite expensive, too.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	However it could be argued that t it is so difficult for moderators to see the difference between someone practicing their freedom of speech and the idea of hate speech against a protected characteristic.	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	I agree	Newspapers could censor certain words that are deemed hateful. This could be done automatically.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	i believe comment are important, to allow people to discuss. sometimes you can get factual information from other people comments
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	The words chosen to be used are very essential when in comes to the reader and a writer. The content that is viewed as a hate speech should not be shown to the other readers. It should automatically give a warning to the writer and after 3 warnings they should be blocked as they do not comply with the terms and conditions.
__label__noRel	definitely agree with this comment,there is no place for aggression in an adult debate	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	allows you to read other people's opinions to help build your own	We need to create a society where we can debate with each other respectfully, we can know which platforms to use and not rile each other up without offending. It is widely suggested that education can address the extent of hate speech: https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/addressing-hate-speech-through-education-global-education-ministers-conference. However, this needs to go hand in hand with moderation of sites to ensure people are kept within reason. It is not a case of any one single solution.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	By monitoring individual responses and removing those not deemed suitable for publication
__label__noRel	very time consuming	By making people aware that hate speech is not good by creating awareness campaigns against hate specch.
__label__noRel	agree with this totally, and I think that was my opinion earlier	I definately think the way forward is to have moderators that will review all comments before they get posted.They can then approve or disapprove all the comments and flag inappropiate user names. Yiou could also add a way for the readers to flag inappropiate comments and these will also flag to the moderators.
__label__noRel	Using algorithms is a valid option for many things, but analyzing text is still quite difficult for computers. They're are not very good at detecting sarcasm or irony, for instance.	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	do u really know the meaning of hate speeches?	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	While yes we should all be able to communicate freely, with the anonymity of the internet internet trolls go too easily unpunished and their actions not removed	I think it'll be hard to do so, because everyone has the right to freedom of speech, but unless the comments brings acts of violence on people then it must be deleted
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	we can do that by having strict rules on language and hate speech where one can be blocked from commenting or their comments gets removed if there is any negativity
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	Use technology to monitor and block users
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Moderate the comments sections!
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	By flagging certain vocabulary which relates to hate speech and once this is flogged, the person commenting is blocked from posting their view. We would need to look at ways of getting around mispellings of the words though, as people could use this to get past the AI.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	Short answer is you can't, as the term 'hate speech' is incredibly vague, and can differ from person to person.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	by not allowing certain words to be used in the comments space
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	There could be a segment in the website that gives informed context to a subject to prevent uninformed comments and furthermore the newspaper should monitor the comments and censor any hate speech comments.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	I am proposing the use of AI to manage this space
__label__noRel	I think people still have the right to comment on an article and give their opinion. It would be wrong to not permit this.	I think the first step to reducing hate speech in readers comments should be in the form of a moderation team in which they filter inappropriate comments. I think it should be a group of people rather than AI to do this to ensure all hate speech within a variety of contexts are eliminated, as if this was done by a computer there is risk of hate spilling through. For example, hate speech on the social media platform Twitter can often be missed as users purposefully misspell hateful speech to ensure it does not flag up on the AI searches, going as far as hateful language misspelt actually trending on Twitter.
__label__noRel	Removing the option for opinion wouldn't stop the hate speech - this will just be featured somewhere else but being able to mark items as unkind would help identify things that may upset some people.	It has been shown that comments sections are popular and do drive traffic to websites and make people spend more time on the site (so pleasing advertisers) So from a commercial/publishing point of view it would seem that some kind of moderation is the best way to deal with the problem and not eliminate the section altogether. (See https://webpublisherpro.com/your-website-needs-a-comments-section/)
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	we should keep comment sections on newspaper websites but we should have moderators to filter out any hate speech
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	I feel that people should be allowed to have freedom of expression online but should be held accountable for vitriolic and unbased hate speech, this could be achieved by proving identity and by using citations and references when posting online
__label__noRel	Freedom of speech and thought are both really important and allow people to sometimes 'clear' their minds of thoughts.	The technical team of the newspaper should select comments that don't promote hate speech and make those comments the only ones that are going to appear on the newspaper's websites.
__label__noRel	anyone could have a problem with another persons point of view	By implimenting a system that can filter out all comments before the comments are added to the website or newspaper for the readers to read
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	most people seem to be of the opinion that cutting comments altogether is not constructive. A good point was made by an individual that viewing opinions from people you like only doesn't help you to grow (echo chamber).
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	Moderating comments sections is a lot of work to do manually, the individuals tasked with it would burn out in short time trying to manage that effectively while also having to read hateful garbage all day. If there was a system to remove hate speech it needs to be automated with an algorithm that catches certain words, then reviewed manually when someone disagrees with the content removed and it not being against guidelines. We use guidelines for everything including media regulations for accurate reporting or having to retract when information is not accurate. It's no different in the comments section, it doesn't remove free speech it regulates it to create a healthy environment to have a conversation in. Over moderation can have as severe of an effect as under, it has to be a system that takes in common complaints from both sides. Not the hate speech side per say but the sides of people who are pro free flowing conversation and those who want more shielding to avoid extremist echo chambers.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	This article shows the benefits that controlling hate speech has, especially on diverse groups. It would be wrong to not attempt to control this situation.	the website should have terms and conditions on the words that can be used and warnings if failure to follow the recommended words .
__label__noRel	You rely on readers actually flagging inappropriate comments and not just comments that they don't like	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	I would disagree richard, newspapers can often fuel hate speech through their phrasing and the way they choose to title their articles therefore it is down to them to avoid hate speech spreading on their websites.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it.

A good point was made by an individual that viewing opinions from people you like only doesn't help you to grow (echo chamber).
__label__noRel	I completely agree. It's not the job of online sites to become speech police. I frequent many different online comment sections, and oddly enough, hateful comments are swiftly dealt with by other contributors. Sometimes the best way to eliminate hate speech, is to allow it to be seen, then vastly condemned by those seeing it. Algorithms should be used to deal with trolling. Honest, sometimes brutal comments should not censored just because they make others uncomfortable.	Everyone is entitled to freedom of speech but hate speech can be detrimental to readers and the topics mental health. I think the best way to deal with hate speech is to have filtered comments, raising awareness and age restrictions on wensites and comment sections
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Make readers agree to not sharing hate speech and let them know that if they do, they will be blocked from commenting.
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	report anyone as soon as it is seen so they can be dealt with and removed.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	As much as it might seem an attempt to constrict expression of thought, I agree comments should no longer be allowed. It always turns into argument and insult. We already know that for every opinion someone else will take the opposite view. A newspaper's view is its own, so let's keep it that way - we already know which way they lean politically. Keep opinions to social media and let people thrash it out there.
__label__noRel	Moderation to reduce hate speech, objectively will be beneficial	It seems this remains a diffcult question, with varying responses on the subject
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Before an opinion is published it must be moderated and if it contains hate speech then the writer will not be able to post it.
__label__noRel	Banning IP addresses could prevent users from a whole house or area being prevented from contributing	the comment section is for sharing information and opinions without the need of hate speech. those who promote and share hate speech should get banned from the comment section
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Strict moderation of comments prior to them being published may be the only way to limit hate speech on comments sections.

__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	I think that keeping an open space for discussion is vital and needed. Strick and easy to understand rules should be there and a group of moderators implementing them as well. We should do more about educating on media ethics, keeping freedom of expression should be combined with counteracting hate speech messages.
__label__noRel	I agree. Freedom of speech must not be quashed. There should be much closer monitoring of comments and removal of hateful/abusive ones.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Totally agree . Users all human beings after all
__label__noRel	I agree that AI moderators offer an ideal solution. I think it's worth considering that having human moderators would mean that there are individuals who have to read through hate speech regularly.

__label__noRel	people need to be nicer online	Strict content moderation
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	In the digital world we live in - unfortunately hate speech is part and parcel of the benefits of having such an open forum and allowing everyone to have a voice.

__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Freedpn of speech doesnt mean you must promote hate speech on newspapers, it basically means you free to voice out your concerns in around society in a more respectfull manner.
__label__noRel	Yes RayC. You have a good point there. Hate speech is totally unnecessary - words can HURT!	The comments could be examined for offensive language. For instance, there might be a robot that scans comments for offensive language and deletes them.

__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	Awareness campaigns need to be implemented to teach people about the significance of avoiding hate speech.
__label__noRel	Reducing scam/spam profiles, or profiles just intended for hate speech protects vulnerable people.	I think through fair moderation, then the amount of hate speech will be reduced.
__label__noRel	I agree this would helpfilter some of the hate speech	We could introduce a system online where it automatically filters out bad language or hate speech by using key words.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	I would almost agree that removing the comments would be beneficial. I've very rarely seen a comment on an article that actually contributed towards learning more about the content. It's typically just people yelling they don't agree without any true thought.
__label__noRel	This would work well with non-bias moderators	The comments could be examined for offensive language. For instance, there might be a robot that scans comments for offensive language and deletes them.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	By outright banning IP addresses which contribute hate speech to platforms, and investing in moderation through human resources and through text analysis tools.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	infringing on free speech	The difficulty with moderation is that it is subjective - if done so via human moderation if there is no existing framework to follow particular viewpoints or comments may not be seen to be worthy of removing though for others this may not be the case. If moderating is done so by filtering words or with no human intervention, over-moderation is a risk. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2056305119832588
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	I found this really interesting, "Khan said the freedom of opinion and expression, including the right to seek, receive and disseminate diverse sources of information, must be upheld by States in times of crises and armed conflict as a precious ‘survival right’ on which people’s lives, health, safety, security and dignity depend." This is similar to what lots of people have been saying regarding worrying that this sort of censorhip could overextend.

__label__noRel	Unmoderated online comment forums are magnets for noxious speech. For years they have carried people’s discontent out into the world, while the writers sit safely behind screens. It’s almost bittersweet to think back on the time we once blamed internet flaming on the online disinhibition of middle school pranksters. It is the many unhappy adults in the electorate who are posting the things they are really thinking in comment boxes. Nearly three-quarters of internet users – 73 percent – have witnessed online harassment. News website comment sections host antagonistic conversations between contributors. Nine out of 10 respondents of a Pew Research study said the online environment was more enabling of criticism. The squabbling can be overwhelming: As many as 34 percent of news commenters and 41 percent of news comment readers identified argumentative comments as the reason they avoid reading or joining the discourse. Multiple studies show online communities develop sophisticated norms that guide participants. Anger begets more anger. Unshackled digital vitriol is now volleyed back and forth online from all sides. Some commenters don’t even care if they are anonymous anymore. Researchers have found real-name comments on social media are actually nastier than unsigned commentary. Historically, American democracy always had some rudeness baked into it. For example, during the presidential election of 1800, incumbent President John Adams’ campaign proclaimed “murder, robbery, rape, adultery and incest will all be openly taught and practiced” if his opponent, Thomas Jefferson, won the presidency. Jefferson, meanwhile, described Adams as “a hideous hermaphroditical character,” with “neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman.” Civility in public discourse is often what people in power expect of their citizens. Demands for civility can be used by those with authority to deny power to those with none. People who feel marginalized or alienated use incivility and civil disobedience to fight the power. By causing offense and indignation, as we saw during Campaign 2016, outsiders gained massive attention for their cause. Yet “democracy only functions when its participants abide by certain conventions, certain codes of conduct and a respect for the process,” wrote cultural journalist Neal Gabler in an eloquent essay about how a hateful electorate threatens democracy. Gabler noted that the 2016 presidential campaign was referred to as the “hate election” because everyone professed to hate both candidates. It turned out to be the hate election, Gabler mused, “because of the hatefulness of the electorate.” He went on:https://theconversation.com/how-news-sites-online-comments-helped-build-our-hateful-electorate-70170	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated.

I've very rarely seen a comment on an article that actually contributed towards learning more about the content. It's typically just people yelling they don't agree without any true thought.
__label__noRel	It would have the advantage of searching out offensive words prior to them actually being printed and could be stopped before they are.	Despite my defence of human moderators, it seems they too are flawed -- check out this article https://www.technologynetworks.com/informatics/news/ai-trusted-as-much-as-humans-to-flag-hate-speech-365777 -- human moderators are not only prone to bias but also impractical. With the huge wealth of content posted every second online, it is unrealistic to expect humans to be able to view, criticise, and moderate every single comment.
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	This is a win or loose situation. People will still continue with their comments even if it is not on the newspapers website. A person can take a screenshot of the topic and then twit it on twitter and then people will give their different opinions. The newspaper can still allow for readers comment however, the hate speech comments can be filtered.

__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	I think certain people should be not allowed to share their opinions publicly because their only intention is to create hate and to upset people. Separately, society need to be educated on how to communicate via Social Media.
__label__noRel	Agree with this, removing the space for commenting without educating people would just move the hate speech elsewhere.	In a survey of news sites it was found that on average 11% of comments are removed...some of these are because they are spam and some because they are offensive. I think that the fact that it's more than one in two really shows how necessary moderation is, these issues are so common.

__label__noRel	Negativity	At the end of the day hate speech is not hate speech to everyone, I ended up reaching the conclusion that everyone has their own opinion about everything, So to want to filter or block comments is not freedom of speech, but building a sensitive society that is scared of debates and confronting serious issues, Its up to the receiver of the comment to act on it or not. Cyber bullying is a different story.
__label__noRel	By eliminating readers comments, the readers will not be allowed to give their opinion on the topic, which infringes free-speech.	Disabling comments reduces free speech and makes everything monitored and authorised - then you have to question who is controlling what we see?
__label__noRel	Moderating will reduce hate speech and allow open discussion without personal, insulting opinions	most people seem to be of the opinion that cutting comments altogether is not constructive. A good point was made by an individual that viewing opinions from people you like only doesn't help you to grow (echo chamber).
__label__noRel	https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/study-social-media-use-linked-to-decline-mental-health	Moderation is key. Plenty of newspapers and online media are able to keep comments open with a bit of moderation.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	I think rather than removing the option to comment/debate below an article, there could be moderators and hate speech buttons and bots to keep hate speech at bay.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	In addition to reducing hate speech by site moderation community moderation could also take place having the ability to flag a post for the attention of moderators which violates terms of service.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	why was the comment removed	read though the comments and only put on the comments with the less hate speech on
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	One cost-effective way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites while promoting reader comments is to outsource reader comments to social media. Comment sections can show comments for the article from social media platforms, while encouraging users to post comments onto these platforms. This way, hate speech can be reduced by social media platforms, which are more experienced with content moderation, have extensive rules in place, and have economies of scale with regard to content moderation compared to newspapers.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	Companies aswell as the users should be liable and held accountable for allowing a platform to be used to share hate speech
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.

An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	I agree with the notion that being able to share our thoughts and feelings is a right and having people share their views can help people to question their own thoughts. The inclusion of moderators to prevent people from posting discriminatory or harmful comments would be good, but difficult to ensure these moderators aren't biased towards one argument
__label__noRel	This is true	By introducing a cyber bullying detecting software
__label__noRel	I agree	The best solution would be one that elegantly ties the reduction of hate speech in the comment section with no detrimental effect to the publics freedom of speech. This could be done by setting guidelines for hate speech, and also ensuring that the public provides identifying information such as their email address and especially their phone number. Both can be tracked to the person. To take it even further would be to be able to collect data such as ip addresses( with the commenters permission of course) when the person sends their comment so as to be able hold them accountable for any hate speech they send in. This will prevent people from using such language and hoping to hide under anonymity.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	As I saw some commentary on this platform, my opinion is that we need 2 things. A submission of personal data before one can have access to post anything related and real time moderation of the comments. Big platforms like YouTube, Instagram and others are held accountable for their users' actions and they have had a lot of success so far.

__label__noRel	Exactly. Just ignore the hate speech. Like in real life you just ignore the bullies	This is right.

__label__noRel	There are always cons in any idea	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	The negative aspect would be how moderators are going to decide whetehr it is a hate crime or not. Manupliating the moderators could be an issue.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	Removing the comment section from online newspapers is not the answer. Allowing people to post their opinions is healthy and a normal part of human society- people will not always agree. However, in order to reduce hate speech, which can so often lead to crime, it could be done so that there are monitors (either human or computer) who check comments before they are posted to ensure they are not hate speech.
__label__noRel	But to what extent should free speech be allowed? Should we as a society allow people that say hateful things against a particular ethnic group, race or gender all in the concept of 'its free speech, you can say whatever' I think that people are able to practice their rights but as soon as it starts becoming oppressive or infringing on another person's right, that is where we should start drawing a line.	I'm of the supporting view that the use of AI to filter out Hate speech could prove to be very useful
__label__noRel	there would be no hate speech	This article below focuses on the negative views of the comment section. I like the quote from Dr Philips, as she explains that more discussion is required, not less, and thus an onsite intervention is required to deal with hate speech as opposed to the removal of the comment section. https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	There should be automatic filters but they are not 100, so there should also be a team of people constanly monitoring and reviewing complaints and reports. I feel like it is the only way to keep the freedom of speech but also protect people who might be victims of it.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	Readers should be able to comment but be informed of certain comments that would be considered hate speech. If they are aware and still choose to comment hateful words, the newspaper website should feel comfortable enough to remove those comments since the reader was informed that comments like those would not be acceptable.
__label__noRel	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button	There absolutely are ways to facilitate healthy conversation and debates without allowing hate speech. Both algorithms and human moderation are ways to ensure debate can continue without resorting to abuse.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	If a media regulate how people respond to their news, they can aid the fight against hate speech.	Some hate speech is actually illegal, so that should definitely be reported and removed. https://www.report-it.org.uk/reporting_internet_hate_crime
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	A way to deal with this could be starting laws against hate speech or have punishments in place.	In today's world where technology has advanced to such a degree, I'm of the belief that creating parameters that protect individuals from any form of hate speech is very much possible through things such as AI. The removing of commenting sections could be argued as a violation to one's freedom of speech, it also means the views and opinions of the public will be lost which could have detrimental effects.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	By utilising AI so that it can look for certain words that could be deemed offensive.
__label__noRel	I agree that education is important.	We can reduce hate speech by regulating comments that are attacking a certain group with no true basis or facts
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	Holding platforms responsible for all content they publish would help
__label__noRel	Internet education about etiquette and how to behave kindly to other people should be enforced.	Having read through the opinions of others, my stance has not completely changed. It is important to censor comments, freedom of speech does not always equate to disrespecting the views and opinions of others. While I agree that comments should be censored, I do not agree that every comment should be removed. As mentioned before, a system can be implemented that removes comments with certain words, thus making the comment section a safe space for all who use it.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I agree	This is not a black or white topic. The question is how exactly we define hate speech. Criticism in itself is not hate speech, but it is easy to take things to extremes, especially when someone expresses their opinion anonymously. Education about the reasons is important to better understand our own feelings and behaviour. Educate people do not restrict them!
__label__noRel	I think it would just become full of comments from people who were writing things just to get a reaction - feeding the trolls!	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	Implementing these can have a favourable outcome.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.

__label__noRel	Regardless of whether stories need opinions added to them, people will do it anyway	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	They could force users to login and even if they chose to post annonymously, it can be flagged for hate speech and they can be banned from using the platform again.
__label__noRel	i agree there has to be a balance, and freedom of speech is important for society.. but there has to be limits as to hate speech, and discrimination.	By utilising AI so that it can look for certain words that could be deemed offensive.

Roughly 95% of that was detected proactively by Facebook with the help of AI - https://www.newsy.com/stories/artificial-intelligence-is-used-to-track-down-hate-speech/#:~:text=Between%20January%20and%20March%202022,themes%20fall%20through%20the%20cracks.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	I agree with the notion that being able to share our thoughts and feelings is a right and having people share their views can help people to question their own thoughts. The inclusion of moderators to prevent people from posting discriminatory or harmful comments would be good, but difficult to ensure these moderators aren't biased towards one argument
__label__noRel	the comment section can actually be a platform for bullying other people and hence it is a solution . removing it will limit publication of the hate speech	I don't think it's fair to eliminate comments from newspaper articles because the public is entitled to have their opinions heard. The best way to deal with hate speech is to moderate each comment before it is posted. Also the newspaper could ban accounts who engage in hate speech in the comments section. This moderation could be done through both human moderators and software to find trigger words signifying hate speech. It's important to democracy that citizens can have their say on the issues that affect their lives.
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	I think we can do this by having comments sufficiently moderated and removed if needed if they are producing hate speech.

__label__noRel	this is a great way to monitor the section	I don't think algorithms are the answer. They need to be very, very sophisticated otherwise they require a human mediator.
__label__noRel	I think that people should be given the opportunity to have free speech but with people who are paid to moderate comments. Free speech should also include people being given the opportunity to say things others do not agree with as long as it is not promoting a violent crime to be committed against someone.	The best way to reduce hate speech would be to make sure that moderators are present to check on comments, it would not be advisable to cancel comments completely due the feedback it gives and people will always have their opinions and sometimes they will involve hate speech, which is unavoidable...

__label__noRel	i agree with this and awareness should be brought to the surface	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

I think that a comment section is necessary for engagement and exchange of ideas but having said that, there should be a code for AI embedded within that platform which will be able to detect hate speech or words classified as hate speech then the AI can delete them automatically. Also people can report the comment and the AI should delete the comment within minutes of it being reported.

First, it would be important to define what hate speech is so that readers that want to post comments have a chance to self-modify their posts. Secondly, having a filter that will automatically block posts that contain proscribed words could also help to reduce the amount of hate speech featured in comments sections.

This is similar to what lots of people have been saying regarding worrying that this sort of censorhip could overextend.

After doing some follow up reading from https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/what-is-online-hate-crime/ I have seen how the anonymity of these online comments can be what makes it so easy for people to be hateful.

However, I am not sure how this would work from a data protection point of view. It is certainly a start.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks.

The rights and liberties of journalists and their role in fostering and developing peaceful societies should be emphasized in media ethics education. The political, social, and cultural rights of individuals and groups, including the freedom of expression, must be made more widely known, as well as the obligations and societal repercussions that come with press freedom.

If we accept that some language is not acceptable due to it's clearly hateful nature then we have to acknowledge that some form of censorship of those particular instances has to occur. I would suggest that eliminating all such spaces from newspaper websites would have a massive detrimental effect on valid, non-bigoted, freedom of speech a cornerstone of western life. We don't ban all cars because some people speed dangerously, we monitor the roads and ban the bad drivers. I suggest that as long as readers comments are monitored continually they should remain.
__label__noRel	i think they should have a filtering software to remove hate speech words and from being posted on the newspaper websites.	every comment submitted by readers must be checked internally for hate speech
__label__noRel	Not if the idea is hateful to minorities.	The only way to combat hate speech is through open debate. Restricting any form of speech (even hate speech) could lead to hateful views becoming unchallenged and potentially result in violence. There is also the issue that newspapers could define hate speech as certain comments they don't like destroying any potential for open debate. By maintaining open debate hate speech can be called out and as a result, become less frequent.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	Allow others users to rate the comments and block those who receive bad ratings
__label__noRel	I disagree, comments are how valid opinions are spread and change is made in the world. If there are no comments, there's no feedback.	Hate speech is something is completely unacceptable and should be eradicated by all means necessary however regulations are our best bet if we are to maintain freedom of speech at the same time.

Having read through the opinions of others, my stance has not completely changed. It is important to censor comments, freedom of speech does not always equate to disrespecting the views and opinions of others.

__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted.

__label__noRel	A different perspective	A possible way to address hate speech on newspaper sites would be to incorporate both human moderators and some sort of AI that monitors for hateful words and comments. The requirement to submit personally identifying information before commenting might also help because without this then anyone can create a fake name that hides the person's true identity so therefore more likely to engage in hate speech. If personal information is required, then hate speech would be less likely.
__label__noRel	The works for the newspaper only, no one will be able to contest what is being written evn if it is wrong	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.

Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them.

__label__noRel	good way to make a point	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

Reducing hate speech shouldn't be the focus. The problem lies in the reactions to it - in particular, giving the drastic perspectives too much attention. This attention only encourages more of the debate and problematic perspectives. Though total ignorance would also be unfair, so really we need a position of just LESS attention and care given to such perspectives.
__label__noRel	It is important to give everyone a point of view and allow them a space to voice it, within reason.	Hate speech can be positive criticism and essential in some posts, altgough it can be offensive and totally uncalled for in other posts.

__label__noRel	I agree most with this post, there's no reason to allow hate speech to exist on social platforms when it's so easy to moderate and control	i agree that people have the right to express their own ideas but you have to be considerate otherwise it can easily be interpreted as hate if your not careful with wordings.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	the comments with hate speech can be remove. and the commenter should be ban for a period of time
__label__noRel	Maybe just turn the comments off what are obviously polarising matters.	By implimenting a system that can filter out all comments before the comments are added to the website or newspaper for the readers to read
__label__noRel	This argument doesn't consider the ways in which certain kinds of speech can suppress other kinds of free speech. If hate speech is allowed to run rampant, this silences and threatens minority speech out of existence.	Strict moderation of comments prior to them being published may be the only way to limit hate speech on comments sections.
__label__noRel	I agree with Andrew. It can also be a form of bullying and those most likely to be affected are the more vulnerable people in society.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I think when there are professionals they can be balanced and have training alongside guidelines which can help guide what is and is not allowed	The key way to do it would be with very in-depth moderation which is non-biased and respects criticisms but its aware when a comment is taken too far and viewed as hate speech. the comment section should not be eliminated but mainly moderated and supervised
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Disabling comments reduces free speech and makes everything monitored and authorised - then you have to question who is controlling what we see?
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	I don't think algorithms are the answer. They need to be very, very sophisticated otherwise they require a human mediator.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	create an algorithm that identifies hate speech and removes it
__label__noRel	How will we know how the public feels about about a certain topic if they cant even give their opinions? I do not think this is fair. At least appropriate measures can be taken in order to stop hate speech.	I think that someone should be assigned as a moderator who assesses comments before they are posted to ensure they don't contain any offensive information
__label__noRel	the public should be able to give their opinions, if you try and stop it they will always find a way to make their voice heard and this is when thigs could get nasty with hate speech.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	It seems like many users think that having your personally details posted along with your comment would be a deterrent for people to comment hate speech
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	you can add an AI system in the website that will scan all comments instantly after they have been posted and it can remove any hate speech before it is seen by many people on the comment section, this method is used by some online communication platforms.
__label__noRel	If the newspapers are providing a platform on which abuse can be given, they do have a responsibility to prevent it. Abuse is in no way shape or form valid criticism.	By using a tool to search for hate speech
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	Moderating is good and maybe informing the person why their message was moderated so that they know and do better next time
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	I disagree with the stance of doing away with the comment section in its entirety, it goes against the premise of media which is to spark a debate or discussion.
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	Blocking words does not stop hate, what we need to do is have a filter that alerts a human so that a post. Posts/users should be identifiable to the platform they post on (not identifiable to the post but to the platform should any hate crime be identified)
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	My final argument is that it is possible to monitor and reduce hate speech on website comments by using both AI and human intelligence
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	There need to be some kind of moderation, either before or after comments are published
__label__noRel	Allowing hate speech, only perpetuates prejudice and discrimination.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	Who guards the guardians?	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	How do you propose to address the root causes?	/?Are there ways to better police it and identify key words/phrases? Is there an automated moderator program?
__label__noRel	https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/juraba52&div=30&id=&page=	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	i believe comment are important, to allow people to discuss. sometimes you can get factual information from other people comments
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	While freedom of speech is a human right, it is imperative to be cognizant of the fact that each and every person has the right to have their rights respected. It is for this reason that readers comments cannot be removed. Everyone has the right to make a comment and we do not necessarily always have to agree, we always have to respect. A system can be put in place to remove any vulgar language.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	Hate speech can be positive criticism and essential in some posts, altgough it can be offensive and totally uncalled for in other posts. A way in which social media apps regulate and monitor the comments, otherwise people have rights to freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	I stand by my position of a moderator system
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	While censoring certain words in the context of a comment would help reduce hate speech, an issue that would need to be considered is the use of images used as hate speech. Some "memes" can contain hate speech to the AI may misinterpret this as a regular image while the image could be posted as hate speech. An example of this is when people on Reddit use images as "memes" containing racism and sometimes the bot does not flag it as racism. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230
__label__noRel	I believe that newspapers are supposed to spark a conversation, the conversation should be had directly in the comment section and should not be moved to different platforms	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	I think moderation is better than asking for a lot of personal data.	I do not think it is possible, in a fair and just way. When speech is restricted that's called censorship. Who would justify the restrictive opinion?
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	the comment section should not be disabled as is it there for the readers to engage with the content uploaded so it makes no sense to close it, however there should be restrictions.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	The technical team of the newspaper should select comments that don't promote hate speech and make those comments the only ones that are going to appear on the newspaper's websites.
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	A lot of the times I hear people railing against the censorship of hatespeech it is because they aren't aware of the damage they are causing or have been caught out saying something they didn't think was bad to begin with. I think that anything that is removed should be explained to the poster as well as the impact that t could have on other people
__label__noRel	It would discourage racism/xenophobia	By using a tool that searches for likely words: hate, etc.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	I think that education with penalties such as exclusion from the community for repeated offences is the best policy. Like many I agree that some people are unaware they unaware they have caused offence to others.
__label__noRel	Comment sections have become so ingrained in the news website experience that their removal will at first seem almost an affront to free speech.	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__noRel	https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-and-real-harm	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	I agree with this argument. It is important to balance the right to freedom of speech against the need to reduce hate speech.	There is a fine line between freedom of speech and hate. And hate can be interpreted differently for different people causing biased censorship. Therefore newspapers should have moderators from both sides of opinion that overlook comments to approve before they are published
__label__noRel	there's always going to be some sort of criticism of freedom of speech	Removing the comment section all together is a fair point as news is meant to be fair and impartial. People share their opinions based on their biases and that's not what the news is for - that's what social media is for. But in this case allowing the comment section to remain would be great if people would not abuse the power to share freely by sharing hate speech and slander. us as humans need to be regulated by a set of rules in order to keep a functioning society and i think a filtered comment section is the solution.
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	In my opinion the comment section should not be removed. I personally get very annoyed if I watch or read something and want to express my opinion, then go down to the comment section to sadly find out the comments are turned off. This limits the freedom of speech and blocks the ability for the people to vent out somehow. I think this builds aggression and causes problems afterwards. The better thing to do is to limit bad speech, foul words and cursing but removing the comments completely is not a good idea.
__label__noRel	No hiding behind false ID	Nowadays with the amount of social media platforms that are available newspapers don't hold as much power. We get all of our news through the spreading of news in social media as seen in this article : https://kettlemag.co.uk/social-media-versus-print-media/
__label__noRel	I think by promoting the hate speech it very much takes away the meaning of the subject. You dont need to be hateful to agree/disagree with something. You can be constructive in your approach and this will have a greater impact on the issue and cause for a logical debate between people. So an element of policing is required	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	yes eliminate them and stop all comments that could offend people	One way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for reader comments would to have active community managers who are activetly managing the comment section. Making sure that all comments are in accordance to the community guidelines.
__label__noRel	I agree	Advanced AI is the ultimate answer. It is the cheapest and most unbiased moderator option.
__label__noRel	People should be allowed to give their opinions because where else will be able to read how people feel about certain things happening around other than comments. I just think they should be monitored and taught to not post hateful comments.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	educational policy	I'm finding replying to comments here really awkward. As soon as I start typing the page moves, grrrr! However, I don't agree with vetting comments. I do agree with free speech, but not hate speech. People are entitled to an opinion without having to be nasty or a keyboard warrior. Moderating could be used to take out hateful comments, without taking away a well rounded debate, but where those lines are drawn is anyones guess!
__label__noRel	free speech	The editor must appoint a diverse panel, meaning from different backgrounds to screen comments
__label__noRel	The comment space gives users a way to vent out their frustration. It is not always nice to see derogatory language but when there is a healthy discussion, it helps people reading them to find very informative.	It goes further than this. We live in a society that has a lot of cry babies. We need to be impervious to negative comments from strangers on a social platform and that is anonymous. Most people need to grow a pair, develop a spine or stop being cry babies. Once this is achieved you will see that any contribution you make to a discussion will be debated in a civilized manner.
__label__noRel	Prevents fake news	There needs to be a fine balance between freedom of expression and stopping hate speech. The best way is for comments to be screened as that would still allow opinions to be shared while ensuring the safety of all readers
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	I think that the idea of users submitting personal data before making a comment can have positive and negative effects - positive in the sense that the user may think twice before posting hate speech and that they can be tracked down and educated; negative in the sense that the user could be on a website that wants to use user's personal data for the wrong reasons. I am still of the view that comments with hate speech need to be filtered out because each individual needs to be responsible in their speech.
__label__noRel	The best way to deal with the issues of hate speech might be to ban the use of specific words or phrases that may amount to hate speech. Removing the comment section completely just allows the publication to share whatever information they want without the opportunity to be challenged by the public.	We can reduce hate speech by regulating comments that are attacking a certain group with no true basis or facts
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	In addition to reducing hate speech by site moderation community moderation could also take place having the ability to flag a post for the attention of moderators which violates terms of service.
__label__noRel	This is a good idea, as it eliminates the need for a moderator to sift through every single comment but rather they only need to look through comments that have triggered the bot. Then, they can make a decision on whether it has truly conveyed hate speech or whether (less likely scenario) there is human/bot error in the process	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	There should already be policies that hinder hate speech as it seems that the problem is escalating	I think with careful moderation, there's nothing wrong with keeping the comments section. Reddit is a fine example of extremely good moderation combined with bots that immediately remove content with insults and hatespeech.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	With rights comes responsibility. We all have freedom of speech but it is our responsibility to ensure that our speech does not cause harm on others. If people do not want to be responsible in their speech, then their speech should be reduced because things have consequences. So, the hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by removing comments with hate speech or having a software that can identify hate speech in a comment before it is posted.
__label__noRel	True. At the end of the day, the publisher controls what is published	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	I think the comments should be monitored to avoid hate speech
__label__noRel	I think with people reading less newspapers both hard copy and online, Print subscription circulations have fallen by 7% over the past two years, from 125 million overall to 116 million, while single-copy sales are down 11%, from 3.2 million in the first half of 2019 to 2.8 million in the first half of this year.17 Dec 2021, the papers are not going to give the time and effort to monitor the comments sections when there's nothing in it for them.	Having a comments section can be ideal to engage in a healthy debate but will need to monitored very strictly to ensure there is no bullying or one sided views be taken against any individuals
__label__noRel	Hate speech causes a lot of issues so it's nearly impossible to ignore. As much as we may have the right to freedom of speech, we also have the responsibility to engage responsibly.	Moderation is necessary. Closing comments is not the answer, as communication can help people to understand each other's viewpoints. If you take comments away because you're afraid of hate speech, you're going to be creating a barrier between you and your audience.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	I'd happily see all comments sections removed for the good of the public in general. Nobody needs to know that Tony from Bognor thinks All Them Lot Should Go Home, because Tony is a twat who shouldn't be given a platform.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	People should be members with addresses checked
__label__noRel	It removes the problem of potential hate speech	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	every online space should have moderation its weird that this is even a discussion	Rarely some very sensitive articles should be allowed to switch off comments sector.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	However there is the potential to much greater exposure to it on online than in past times. Therefore I continue to believe that greater controls on those posting comments will decrease mindless hate speech and promote constructive debate.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	Removing hate speech comments is also not a good thing because with the technology that we have, people will go and create fake accounts and still go back to comment hatefully and disrespecting words of which it will be a daunting task to delete all the comments
__label__noRel	I would agree that a moderator system would be a better choice than removing the comments.	Some people just like to spread their negative vibes on strangers, not worried about serious consequences, as the worst thing that can happen to them is the comment being removed. There should be consequences!
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	Maybe filter through comments
__label__noRel	allows you to read other people's opinions to help build your own	By using a tool that searches for likely words: hate, etc.
__label__noRel	There are always other spaces, such as reddit or twitter, where one can discuss articles- they do not have to be discussed on the same page they are presented	by blocking users who violate 'hate speech rules', i feel it should be clearly stated what hate speech is.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Have them reviewed after they are posted and do not allow them to be viewed before they are revied, as well as keeping tabs on the user posting the comments.
__label__noRel	Yes, you can have your own opinion but that doesnt mean you have the right to spread hate.	Alternatively I'd offer the opinion that goes against the question and states that we shouldn't offer a space for readers comments (and thus hate speech) at all on news since it's primarily a site and source for news. Systems like https://ground.news/ have been providing news and removing bias without a social aspect already and since third party social/sharing/commentary sites handle discussion and the problem of hate speech far better than newspaper websites presumably can hope to, the solution seems intuitive: remove it and let that happen organically on other websites and platforms.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.

__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	There needs to be rules and regulations stating the type of comments that can be made about other people. There should also be verification of a persons identity everytime they make a comment so that is visible who the statement was made by. Newspaper articles should constantly ready and delete hate speech comment.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can spread rapidly, and destroy lives. It is offensive, hurtful and can ruin people. I think this is a very bad opinion to take.	Companies aswell as the users should be liable and held accountable for allowing a platform to be used to share hate speech
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	having a screener in the background conrtolling everything thats coming in and also comment section
__label__noRel	freedom of speech is important but not at the cost of other rights	I think it's a bit of a lost cause. People will put hate speech in. The only way to stop it, I think is to not allow comments to be made. Technically, that's what happens with print versions of newspapers. We just read the article. Anyone who wants to express an opinion can write a letter to the editor. (Who would screen out hate stuff!). But, we live in an online world. So people expect to be able to have their say. And people probably wouldn't subscribe if they can't interact on an online service. Anyway, I do think people having verified accounts might help. Need to stop the "anonymous" profiles - the coward's castle types.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	"Freedom of Speech'...that's a popular consensus among the masses, regardless of the "casualities" that are left on the wayside. Having reread a lot of the comments posted here, I do consider the possibility of having people comment as they wish, politically correct or not. HOWEVER, let there be consequences involved, such as naming and shaming, and acquring user details if need be, after all, things such as cyber crime, online harrassment, etc do exist, am I right? And so, if such a comment borders on this, let it become a criminal matter and have law enforcement dealing specifically in cyber-related crimes become involved. Problem solved.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	This is right.

__label__noRel	One sided opinions	By using a tool to search for hate speech
__label__noRel	I would agree, with addition that also misinformation, especially one that could induce negative consequences should be treated the same as hate speech	I am unsure if there is a way to reduce hate speech. One persons 'hate speech' is anothers 'freedom of speech'. As a supposedly democratic nation, we need to be able to permit people from all walks of lives and experiences to air their own personal views, whether these are educated views or not.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	I think in order to eliminate hate speech, the comment section itself must be completely eradicated to take a way all potential risk. Newspapers have the sole purpose of giving accurate depictions of current events, there is no responsibility for them to offer social commentary space. One only has to look at the hatred filled comments of the Daily Mail web pages to see the concerning language being used on a regular basis.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	passing legislation on free speech is difficult especially in countries with entrenched codified constitutions	State that the editor is free to print or not print any comments, and his/hers is the final decision.
__label__noRel	Having moderators filter out bad words or comments that contain hate speech would do so much good. This allows everybody to comment their opinion but remove those that are hateful and disrespectful.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	banning certain words would absolutely work.	Community moderation is used on many platforms to allow discussion whilst preventing hate speech from arising, however this is greatly dependent on human participation which can take a lot of work depending on the size of the community. Additionally, the removal of hateful comments can better a comment section, but will not change a commenters views- this has led to the development of more insular online communities fostering these more extreme or hateful views. People will create a space for their commentary if there isn't one provided (or if their comments are removed from somewhere). A lot of this comes down to what a given newspaper wants to be associated with (in the sense of their brand) as opposed to maintaining the sanctity of online discussion.

Subject to flaws if misinterpreted by moderators/other commenters.	the best way is for companies to filter hate speech and remove it as long as the criteria for hate speech comes from an independent organisation. If companies themselves govern what is hate speech then we would become subject to there rules which you would lose the point of freedom of speech. Also there should be more support in the community for people who are being targeted in hate speech attacks.

I disagree. Comments might be useful for users and also the owners of the newspapers. Though, asking people to identify themselves when registering could help reduce hate speech, as people would not be able to do whatever they want anonymously.
__label__noRel	Debate is important	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes.

If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	I enjoy reading through comments and I don't think that they should be removed, but there should be a lot more monitoring going on to remove any hateful ones as soon as they are posted.

I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	I share the same opinion on that having a bot that can check for hate speech is the way either block users who use hate speech or put them on time out.	There is a fine line between freedom of speech and hate. And hate can be interpreted differently for different people causing biased censorship.

__label__noRel	Implementing these can have a favourable outcome.	Although it would be fair to allow for both critical and positive input, I believe that newspaper websites should have a mechanism in place that can identify hate speech and restrict individuals who use it.

__label__noRel	Unmoderated online comment forums are magnets for noxious speech. For years they have carried people’s discontent out into the world, while the writers sit safely behind screens. It’s almost bittersweet to think back on the time we once blamed internet flaming on the online disinhibition of middle school pranksters. It is the many unhappy adults in the electorate who are posting the things they are really thinking in comment boxes. Nearly three-quarters of internet users – 73 percent – have witnessed online harassment. News website comment sections host antagonistic conversations between contributors. Nine out of 10 respondents of a Pew Research study said the online environment was more enabling of criticism. The squabbling can be overwhelming: As many as 34 percent of news commenters and 41 percent of news comment readers identified argumentative comments as the reason they avoid reading or joining the discourse. Multiple studies show online communities develop sophisticated norms that guide participants. Anger begets more anger. Unshackled digital vitriol is now volleyed back and forth online from all sides. Some commenters don’t even care if they are anonymous anymore. Researchers have found real-name comments on social media are actually nastier than unsigned commentary. Historically, American democracy always had some rudeness baked into it. For example, during the presidential election of 1800, incumbent President John Adams’ campaign proclaimed “murder, robbery, rape, adultery and incest will all be openly taught and practiced” if his opponent, Thomas Jefferson, won the presidency. Jefferson, meanwhile, described Adams as “a hideous hermaphroditical character,” with “neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman.” Civility in public discourse is often what people in power expect of their citizens. Demands for civility can be used by those with authority to deny power to those with none. People who feel marginalized or alienated use incivility and civil disobedience to fight the power. By causing offense and indignation, as we saw during Campaign 2016, outsiders gained massive attention for their cause. Yet “democracy only functions when its participants abide by certain conventions, certain codes of conduct and a respect for the process,” wrote cultural journalist Neal Gabler in an eloquent essay about how a hateful electorate threatens democracy. Gabler noted that the 2016 presidential campaign was referred to as the “hate election” because everyone professed to hate both candidates. It turned out to be the hate election, Gabler mused, “because of the hatefulness of the electorate.” He went on:	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	I don't agree with handing over a lot of personal data as this could be misused and seems like an overstep of personal freedoms and privacy	AI could be used to flag hate speech, meaning comments that are hate speech can be flagged at the time.

__label__noRel	This is a very good point. And will make the reading experience pleasant. Another method that can combat hate speech is education.

__label__noRel	I agree	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	There must be some sort of check not censorship	I think that the warning system is a good route, as the AI might eliminate valid arguments and miss hate speech accidentally. A warning system would still need an AI, but it warns users that their comment may be hate speech and if it is, the user can rethink their wording or risk posting it. If they post it, maybe a manual review can happen to determine if it was hate speech or not.

__label__noRel	Having real people that moderate comments on a newspaper website where there are thousands of comments is unrealistic. At best you could have an algorithm that auto bans comments that contain key words and/or phrases and then have those reviewed by a real person.	Discussion can be encouraged, but so often it leads to hate speech / one sided arguments. There needs to be a moderator in place to delete / hide certain comments, so free speech is allowed, but hate speech is not.

__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	Regulations of comment sections has been proven with various other platforms to be the best solution. When there are clear rules put in place regarding what should be considered as hate speech and the consequences of the part taking in such could lead to eg.

The difficulty with moderation is that it is subjective - if done so via human moderation if there is no existing framework to follow particular viewpoints or comments may not be seen to be worthy of removing though for others this may not be the case.

A possible way to address hate speech on newspaper sites would be to incorporate both human moderators and some sort of AI that monitors for hateful words and comments.

My position as a reader and my argument is that bases on the rules of speech people have freedom of speech and expression.

Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	I agree	I am reminded while discussing this of the way Daily Mail in UK handles the comments section. It just mentions on top of the comments page that theses comments are not moderated.So it allows everybody to express their opionion. This is how it should be done in my opinion

__label__noRel	the things is they might create fake accounts or have bots commenting on their behalf.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes.

Well..hate speech is a problem then there is freedom of speech as well. There is a possibility a writer is giving valid points.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	Hate speech invites violence and undermines people
__label__noRel	It is too dangerous to allow everyone and anyone to say exactly what they like, there has to be some rules in order to protect people. It's a form of manners that we expect from each other in every day life, and should be no different just because we are online saying something.	Community moderation is used on many platforms to allow discussion whilst preventing hate speech from arising, however this is greatly dependent on human participation which can take a lot of work depending on the size of the community. Additionally, the removal of hateful comments can better a comment section, but will not change a commenters views- this has led to the development of more insular online communities fostering these more extreme or hateful views. People will create a space for their commentary if there isn't one provided (or if their comments are removed from somewhere). A lot of this comes down to what a given newspaper wants to be associated with (in the sense of their brand) as opposed to maintaining the sanctity of online discussion.

__label__noRel	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated.

__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	I think rather than removing the option to comment/debate below an article, there could be moderators and hate speech buttons and bots to keep hate speech at bay.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	I think that education with penalties such as exclusion from the community for repeated offences is the best policy. Like many I agree that some people are unaware they unaware they have caused offence to others.

__label__noRel	Internet education is definitely needed	people feel powerful behind an anonymous account, its easier to say things you would never normally say under the guise of anonymity, if it was easier to link a comment to who it came from and if people actually faced consequences from posting hate then this could help stop it.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	But what about those who were going to give positive comments. I believe comments should just be monitored
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	It is important to allow people to express their view to abide with freedom of speech. However, having the option to view these comment with a warning would allow people to ignore potential hate speech comments but still lets them read it if they want to.
__label__noRel	Realistically this would probably work, but it would no doubt still have problems like people raising issues of 'suppressing free speech' etc.	create a team of people that can look for and remove the hate speech and leave all other respectful arguments to make the comment section diverse.
__label__noRel	I agree, these may seem tedious at first but they are necessary actions newspapers should consider.	Moderating comments sections is a lot of work to do manually, the individuals tasked with it would burn out in short time trying to manage that effectively while also having to read hateful garbage all day. If there was a system to remove hate speech it needs to be automated with an algorithm that catches certain words, then reviewed manually when someone disagrees with the content removed and it not being against guidelines. We use guidelines for everything including media regulations for accurate reporting or having to retract when information is not accurate. It's no different in the comments section, it doesn't remove free speech it regulates it to create a healthy environment to have a conversation in. Over moderation can have as severe of an effect as under, it has to be a system that takes in common complaints from both sides. Not the hate speech side per say but the sides of people who are pro free flowing conversation and those who want more shielding to avoid extremist echo chambers.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I absolutely agree. The first sentence sums it perfectly!	We should all have the option to voice our opinion. If doing so can result in hate speech, then we have to find a way to fight it instead of trying to eliminate comments altogether. Flagging certain words or using algorithms could potentially could help hide comments that don't add any value and are just trying to cause harm
__label__noRel	While I agree that hate speech is such, I feel like getting rid of the comment section would really go backwards and do more harm than good.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	hate sppech exists wheather in a comments section or not	I think that there should be techologies that are able to scan and the comment section to detect and flag any offensive/vulgar words in the comments before the comments are published.
__label__noRel	Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tay_(bot)#Second_release_and_shutdown	Comment sections are meant for social media platforms. The newspaper can post on a platform such as twitter in order to get comments - while disabling comments on their own platform.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	I enjoy reading through comments and I don't think that they should be removed, but there should be a lot more monitoring going on to remove any hateful ones as soon as they are posted.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree, newspapers should remain impartial as much as possibe and outsource the management to a third party that most consumers of media can agree on to form that structure for defining and removing comments.	Having the option for complete anonimity and alter egos should be removed. I believe people will be much more careful with what they say if their name and face is attached to it.
__label__noRel	This is true, moreover as it is said in this article https://medium.com/@flytedesk/the-pros-and-cons-of-removing-a-website-comment-section-9bea62f8e42b, removing a comment section might be thought by some users as a going against free speech and they will also spend less time on the website, leading to worse performances of the brand/website.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	it would be a less divisive place	comment sections should not be removed as that will prevent those with positive comments form sharing their thoughts, they should instead be reviewed regulary so that hate speech is flagged and removed another solution is for comments to be approved by moderators before they go public
__label__noRel	I agree most with this post, there's no reason to allow hate speech to exist on social platforms when it's so easy to moderate and control	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	By having an algorithm that detects and deletes any hate speech comment.
__label__noRel	I agree with this sentiment as people will be more conscious of their opinions.	I think that any 'contributors' should have a profile and should not be allowed to use an alias. I also think that there should be moderators looking at every post before it is published online.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	That would take away free speech, however I think they need to add some sort of AI that can immediately pick up any forms of hate speech and immediately delete or even block it
__label__noRel	The algorithm could be really bad at catching irony which can be really harmful as well.	Is it really hate speech or is it just an opinion that we don't want to hear?
__label__noRel	In the same way that society needs to fight hate, the Internet needs to fight online hate.	The comments section may be removed on especially conflicting topics/conversations.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	I think the first step to reducing hate speech in readers comments should be in the form of a moderation team in which they filter inappropriate comments. I think it should be a group of people rather than AI to do this to ensure all hate speech within a variety of contexts are eliminated, as if this was done by a computer there is risk of hate spilling through. For example, hate speech on the social media platform Twitter can often be missed as users purposefully misspell hateful speech to ensure it does not flag up on the AI searches, going as far as hateful language misspelt actually trending on Twitter.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.

I think that to prevent hate sppech it will start with educating young people
__label__noRel	Absolutely, the issue of sharing inflammatory or misleading news is important to address and change. News outlets are responsible for how they present their stories and how the narrative changes in the comment section below. They're also responsible for the real world violence as a result of willingly hosting hate speech on their platform whether they're active or inactive on their handling of the comments sections.	I think you can put a price to the website- a subscription to readers.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__noRel	Removing this option would not allow those who make negative comments ritually	Is it necessary to have readers comments? What do they add to the article?
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	Focus on neural subjects, but in reality hate speech is just a part of life
__label__noRel	it would give focus to the journalism.	by blocking users who violate 'hate speech rules', i feel it should be clearly stated what hate speech is.
__label__noRel	This removes balanced media consumption (people will get even more stuck in echo chambers!) and the idea of free-press means that there should be freedom to cross-examine	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__noRel	Hateful comments should allow respondents to persuade otherwise. Comments can be a good force for change and shouldn't be cancelled.	I definitely think newspapers should remove the comment space because it encourages trolls and hate speech
__label__noRel	true, but maybe they can remove anonymity so that everyone can be accountable for what they say.	Removing the comment section will not solve the problem. It will just create a filling of censorship and will make debate and dialogue vanish. It is important that people discuss news topics and also give feedback on those news to the newspaper. It is important to moderate this comments in a strict no hate speech way and bring accountability in. Eliminating comments will just hide a problem that needs to be fixed by moderating and educating people.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks.

By educating people that not everything written in newspapers is true, they should egnore some information
__label__noRel	hate speech online only leads to hate speech in real life. online is where much of the real world violence is incited and begins.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	Evidence shows that it is more likely to be a constructive discussion on the newspaper website rather than on Facebook (which is where it would end up if you removed the comments section)	What about allowing the comment section, but having a built-in screener running in the background, that automatically prevents posts with certain hateful words it is built to detect?
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	I think we firstly have to call out hate speech in order for people to learn that it is not okay and unacceptable. The reason being online 'haters' tend to abuse their right to free speech such that it infringes upon the next person because they have the comfort of knowing that nobody will find put who they really are and confront them. By calling out users on the newspaper website and responding to their comment as the moderator of the comments, and actually suspending their accounts because of it can go a long way.
__label__noRel	I agree, cancelling opinions is reducing free speech, but there needs to be a bar to which all comments are moderated and allowed/prohibited.	This article made me reflect on the definition of hate speech and I aggree with blocking comments that go against a persons protected characteristics - if a comment like that is made, it should instantly be banned from the platform / comment section. https://about.fb.com/news/2017/06/hard-questions-hate-speech/
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	In my country, and I have no doubt in many others, incitement to hatred is punishable by law. So, when you write that it is not the problem of newspapers or websites, I can only be astonished. It is too easy to start a controversy that may have consequences and to defend it by saying: "we have started a discussion, the outcome is not our responsibility, we wash our hands of it".	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way.

__label__noRel	everyone should be entitled to free speech	I also think the concept of Counterspeech to reduce the impact of hate speech could be beneficial.https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/counterspeech-better-way-tackling-online-hate
__label__noRel	this literally defeats the point of the internet. We stopped being passive consumers a while ago, and removing the ability to express your opinion is moving back instead of forward.	There is a careful balance to be made between protecting others from the effects of hate speech and protecting free speech. Online hate speech unfortunately can have the effect of increasing violence against minorities (https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons) but blocking all free speech because of the actions of a few seems like a poor decision. More must be done to remove hate speech online quickly and this means spending more money tackling it.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	By putting in a classing program that will read and class information as it enters. That way things will work nicely and we wont see more of hate speech
__label__noRel	Re-educating is key to reducing hate speech.	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	basing it on the public opinion is better. So I agree with the second part more	you should autoban key hate speech words
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__noRel	Good. As long as it wasn't reported and the opinion was well written.	I still think a filtering system of removing categorically hateful words could help a little, but there is still the big problem of other comments bypassing that. I think an independant and unbiased moderation team could help to remove the issue of the newspapers removing valid critisism or comments about inaccurate reporting for example.
__label__noRel	i agree, there should be monitors to stop this practise	Limiting the algorithms push to only show negative or controversial viewpoints would go a long way to decreasing the hate comments.
__label__noRel	I think that this is correct but mst places have a law or legal guideline as to what it considered hatespeech n that country	I enjoy reading through comments and I don't think that they should be removed, but there should be a lot more monitoring going on to remove any hateful ones as soon as they are posted.
__label__noRel	Taking us to a reputable source.	Maybe online newspapers can invest in text mining, where if hate speech is detected, the comment will not go through. Or, in the comments section, there could be a greyed message in the background that states a non-tolerance to hate speech.
__label__noRel	Beneficial to the masses.	Overall I think I agree with some of the mentions that removing the comments section does reduce freedom of speech. We should be allowed to comment and share opinions on any topic as long as it isn't hate speech.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	What is characterised as hate speech needs to be assessed on a case by case basis. It is not absolute
__label__noRel	Freedom of speech and thought are both really important and allow people to sometimes 'clear' their minds of thoughts.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	Whatever the decision may be, the law and freedom of speech needs to be considered
__label__noRel	maybe get something to control what comes in and goes out	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	I agree this article https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/03/29/the-future-of-free-speech-trolls-anonymity-and-fake-news-online/ speaks about hthis also. Being anon givens comfortability and lets people hide behind a false identity, taking that away would likely reduce hate speech on popular newspaper outlets out of fear of being identified. However, those with these views would likely continue on more far-right news outlets	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	In theory, I really like this idea and feel it could minimise bullying and hate speech online.	Yes there must be a a strong policy for reviewal before publishing.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	I think removing the comment space is just avoiding the problem. There can be interesting and thoughtful comments and we would miss from them. Newspapers websites should instead try to regulate the comment space by introducing a bot or hiring appropriate moderators or there should be some punishment to discourage the use of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	That will take too long time to do manually, so it's best to ban some words in the start. If the user is using to many of the banned words, then ban the user automatically.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	That people can write hate comments	Regulations of comment sections has been proven with various other platforms to be the best solution. When there are clear rules put in place regarding what should be considered as hate speech and the consequences of the part taking in such could lead to eg. A ban from the being able to comment for a certain period of time.
__label__noRel	very true	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Newspapers and free speech functioned well for a couple of hundred years without instant comments. People used to write letters to the newspaper, including their name. The newspaper would then publish some letters anonymously. This meant that people were protected but offered well considered opinions, rather than abusive or nasty comments. Perhaps a slower postal system encourages better behaviour rather than an amplified Twitter-esque school-yard of bullying and abuse.
__label__noRel	but how do you reduce hate speech	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	Some people may turn bitter due to being told what they should and shouldn't do.	Removing the comment section from online newspapers is not the answer. Allowing people to post their opinions is healthy and a normal part of human society- people will not always agree. However, in order to reduce hate speech, which can so often lead to crime, it could be done so that there are monitors (either human or computer) who check comments before they are posted to ensure they are not hate speech.
__label__noRel	good way to make a point	We can reduce hate speech by having it moderated
__label__noRel	I agree with this however sometimes 'hate speech' can be subjective between different people. You have your clear and obvious examples of hate and some comments can be up for opinion	Again I think that removing comment sections entirely would overall be a negative thing. Yes, there are people who abuse the comments section and it they can use it to promote hate speech, but with the right tools this could be moderated. Removing comment sections entirely leaves us with a lack of space for healthy discussion and debate, new ideas and opportunities for learning
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	Reduce the anonymity that hate-speech writers can hide behind - without that shield some may be less inclined to post because it can be traced back to them
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	Hate-speech is part of free-speech, it's hard to focus on one without affecting the other so what should be done is to write articles differently, a neutral way where both sides can see themselves because we become less aggressive when we feel part of a group
__label__noRel	there would be no hate speech	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	I believe the fairest way is the hardest way and that's to have a small group of people moderating REAL hate speech and spam. If someone wants to just use a racist term or promote their website, then these people's comment should be removed and they should be banned from commenting for a period of time. The idea to remove comments entirely is absurd as the news is not trustworthy enough to be the sole voice people hear. We need to hear other voices.
__label__noRel	Allowing the readers to push a post out of air by flagging it could be just as easily abused by people to mass flag posts they dont like for political or personal reasons and create more problems than it solves	newspapers should not have a comments section.
__label__noRel	If a newspaper does not do anything, it might facilitate hate speech and help it reach to millions of people by simply hosting it on their website. Therefore there is a responsibility.	Removing the comment section will only create a bigger revolt and uprise from people that write hate speech, and it will move to another media outlets. So the problem should be treated not silenced it. It is the responsibility of newspapers websites to police hate speech in order to create a safe environment for an healthy discussion about a news article. Otherwise you are cutting short an experience that users might want to have. So by censoring all the comment section your make erverybody pay a price for something that they haven't done. Moderation is the key and should be done my the newspapers websites according to the values they have.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	Perhaps newspapers could use similar tools to respondology (https://respondology.com/ ) or hive moderation (https://hivemoderation.com ) that can identify and block hateful speech. This might well work and I think both of these use AI.
__label__noRel	Some people may turn bitter due to being told what they should and shouldn't do.	I would almost agree that removing the comments would be beneficial. I've very rarely seen a comment on an article that actually contributed towards learning more about the content. It's typically just people yelling they don't agree without any true thought.
__label__noRel	No fact checking	"Freedom of Speech'...that's a popular consensus among the masses, regardless of the "casualities" that are left on the wayside. Having reread a lot of the comments posted here, I do consider the possibility of having people comment as they wish, politically correct or not. HOWEVER, let there be consequences involved, such as naming and shaming, and acquring user details if need be, after all, things such as cyber crime, online harrassment, etc do exist, am I right? And so, if such a comment borders on this, let it become a criminal matter and have law enforcement dealing specifically in cyber-related crimes become involved. Problem solved.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Registering with ID is the single step that would improve incidences of hate speech in comments section. That coupled with live moderation either by AI or human, and following rules that can quickly adapt to change should greatly rduce hate speech.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	we should keep comment sections on newspaper websites but we should have moderators to filter out any hate speech
__label__noRel	allows you to read other people's opinions to help build your own	I think rather than removing the option to comment/debate below an article, there could be moderators and hate speech buttons and bots to keep hate speech at bay.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Comment space encourages discussion of important topics and allows free exchange of information and so should not be eliminated. Independent moderators should be used in order to ensure that hate speech is quickly deleted and encourage users to express their ideas without using inappropriate or aggressive language.
__label__noRel	I agree in maybe censoring certain words but having moderators doesn't site well with me at all - it's getting to the point where only woke views are allowed to be expressed.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Newspaper should avoid subscription from people who use hate speech
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	Moderation of the comments section
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	There should be a strict comment management system in place, someone has to supervise it and react (and possibly penalise) to users spreading hate speech. The comments should not be anonymous since people feel more inclined to be hostile when hiding under a pseudonym. Maybe asking to verify your identity before posting a comment would make people think more before spreading hate.
__label__noRel	Removing the comments section won't make much difference as people just migrate to different platforms to continue posting hate speech, the EU setup a code of conduct for countering illegal hate speech, https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/combatting-discrimination/racism-and-xenophobia/eu-code-conduct-countering-illegal-hate-speech-online_en, this has had an effect on hate speech online and is something that newspapers can be part of if they want to help stop hate speech being posted by users responding to online articles.	This is something that I think is impossible to do. One can never ever be sure of people s intensions. I don't believe newspaper websites should even have space for readers comments , there are other platforms where readers can express themselves

If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	By allowing a section that briefly educates the viewers regarding the situation before they even get to the part of comment sections.
__label__noRel	when hate speech encourages violence or discrimination against any specific class of people it should be removed regardless of how inoffensive an particular individual might find it	Monitoring of comment areas is not realistic
__label__noRel	I like it but i worry it would just be ignored. Just removing a comment isn't much of a deterrent	Is it really hate speech or is it just an opinion that we don't want to hear?
__label__noRel	does take a lot of work/ man power or bots which could over filter comment sections	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	Who deems whether criticism is valid or invalid in this situation? I guess there will always be conflicting opinions and ideas, but over policing of this may not be the solution to managing hate speech.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.

__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	Companies aswell as the users should be liable and held accountable for allowing a platform to be used to share hate speech
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	We could introduce a system online where it automatically filters out bad language or hate speech by using key words.
__label__noRel	people naturally get angry so its difficult to reduce hate speech without any group being offended to some distinction	Some of the comment section of some newspaper articles are not worth reading and may sometimes spoil the reading experience. https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	This is not just a newspaper comment section problem... it's a social media problem as well, more like an internet problem. We need way to not push people away, but educate them.

__label__noRel	Tracking details could become intrusive.	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	I think it'll be hard to do so, because everyone has the right to freedom of speech, but unless the comments brings acts of violence on people then it must be deleted
__label__noRel	People with genuine hateful intentions will not change because of this.	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions

__label__noRel	Yes, freedom of speech is very important in this day and age.	There is a careful balance to be made between protecting others from the effects of hate speech and protecting free speech. Online hate speech unfortunately can have the effect of increasing violence against minorities (https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons) but blocking all free speech because of the actions of a few seems like a poor decision. More must be done to remove hate speech online quickly and this means spending more money tackling it.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	not true	Control what is printed or posted to make sure that it is diverse and does not contain any hate speech but the message they are trying to get across they are able to. That way newspaper can leave the comment section and different opinions are heard and expressed and no one gets hurt.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	you ca reduce hate speech by adding an ai bot that can distinguishly remove between violent words from a comment. A report button is as useful which can allow for moderators to review comments and decide on the level of polarization.
__label__noRel	I agree	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	Agreed. And many of these potential solutions are also not successful at limiting harmful content (https://slate.com/technology/2018/05/the-facebook-upvote-and-downvote-experiment-is-a-bust.html). As long as the platform is comforming to the laws of the country then it should not have to introduce further measures to limit hate speech at the expense of preventing free and open discussion.	Moderation is key. Plenty of newspapers and online media are able to keep comments open with a bit of moderation.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	We need a more thick skin with some of our debate topics if we want to win arguements against "hate"
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	A possible way to address hate speech on newspaper sites would be to incorporate both human moderators and some sort of AI that monitors for hateful words and comments. The requirement to submit personally identifying information before commenting might also help because without this then anyone can create a fake name that hides the person's true identity so therefore more likely to engage in hate speech. If personal information is required, then hate speech would be less likely.
__label__noRel	When moderators have to approve all comments before they get posted you might create an environment where comments the moderator does not agree with do not get posted at all. The better option in my opinion would the second one where you allow readers to flag inappropriate comments, together with a moderator team reviewing these comments. In that case there is a public consensus and more transparency.	Every person should be traceable, so they are accountable. If your comments consist of hate speech or are offensive then you be accounable.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	I would disagree richard, newspapers can often fuel hate speech through their phrasing and the way they choose to title their articles therefore it is down to them to avoid hate speech spreading on their websites.
__label__noRel	the writer will not feel disheartened	People tend to comment just to rile others up, which means it will be a lot of work to moderate. Perhaps an all or nothing approach is best.
__label__noRel	I would imagine that it would be difficult to filter out all of the hate speech	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	I agree to some extent. I think there are some obvious exceptions but otherwise anytime someone disagrees they can say they find it offensive or hateful and want it removed.

__label__noRel	to make everyone fairly represented to make sure	Commenters should agree to abide by all rules when signing up to the website and he banned for breaking the rules.

I was completely taken aback by some strong stances to remove the comment space, and the belief in that because Newspapers should be one-sided providers. I would disagree because newspaper share societal information and society should be allowed to engage and be part of the conversation instead of just consuming whatever information is being released for consumption. It has been seen as a result of other newspaper websites removing the comment section that it reduces the trust of the reader because they are aware of the bias of the information they are consuming, and also it reduces the amount of time readers spend on these sites because there is no community engagements.

__label__noRel	it removes the right of freedom of speech	every comment submitted by readers must be checked internally for hate speech
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	I think we can do this by having comments sufficiently moderated and removed if needed if they are producing hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree	In the digital world we live in - unfortunately hate speech is part and parcel of the benefits of having such an open forum and allowing everyone to have a voice. Hate speech is made by a minuscule minority of people. Perhaps have a 'report hate speech' button that members of the community can use.

__label__noRel	If comments are present they should not be regulated. People should not allow themselves to be personally offended by the opinions of others. People have a right to their own beliefs and opinions.	In order for effective moderation to occur, some kind of consensus or clearly reachable policy on what constitutes hate speech (including dogwhistling, which may be less clear to a lay viewer) would need to be in place. This might require too much buy-in from commenters, but is necessary if anything can be consistently enforced.
__label__noRel	Agree with this. It's about getting the balance right to allow people to voice their opinions and add to the discussion without being hateful to others	https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3394231.3397902
__label__noRel	This puts the power in many people's hands	I agree with some other opinions on the use of A1 to flag or censor certain words that constitute hate or violent speech. It would also be beneficial to have a human supervisor from the organisation and another external body review the activities of the AI to ensure accuracy and consistency.
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	I think we should just collect personal information. It works in South Korea. People will behave if their are not anonymous. Modertors are important too, but not enough,
__label__noRel	An issue is how can we differentiate being aggressive from being passionate. This only leaves room for newspapers to censor comments they do not like.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.

__label__noRel	yes definately, removal of the section is an infringement rather find a way to navigate around sensitive or hate speech comments. maybe burn subscription of that particular individual	People are allowed to have different views on certain topics and to engage with others on newspaper websites but this will be prevented by hate speech which may make other readers to stop reading

__label__noRel	I think the fact that Facebook, one of the richest companies in the world, struggle with moderation points to the fact that small local newspapers would struggle. Especially if one of their stores goes viral or something.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information.

__label__noRel	I agree that providing ID could be a way to help with this.	Blocking words does not stop hate, what we need to do is have a filter that alerts a human so that a post.

__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.

Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	I agree	Despite our general right to freedom of speech, hate speech remains inextricably linked to hate crimes and intolerance. A hard stance should be taken by newspapers against hate speech, utilising moderators to remove hateful comments, despite the fact that it could be construed as a restriction on free speech.
__label__noRel	I would agree, but this article (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0163443712472089?casa_token=FJm_UB0wIqEAAAAA%3ALr9dI-lrHJemMa9XgBVkx8tCkSQUSUAg14owxExDkpThv0tpIu6LJySR_p7EJ_lPqQbiATTxEfULs7k) states that filtering racism doesn't really stop racism, it just encourages it to go elsewhere. Maybe it will protect sites that use it, but otherwise, people will still find racism online. And maybe that's not the responsibility of the news site, but I find it disheartening still.	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	This is correct, as blocking free speech altogether leads us into a very different type of society. It is a tricky dilemma, how to allow free speech but prevent hate speech, but one that does need attention and ideas	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/juraba52&div=30&id=&page=	I think it is important for people to be able to comment on newspapers websites, but I think there needs to be a way of moderating the comments section to prevent/remove hate speech.

I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	In today's world where technology has advanced to such a degree, I'm of the belief that creating parameters that protect individuals from any form of hate speech is very much possible through things such as AI. The removing of commenting sections could be argued as a violation to one's freedom of speech, it also means the views and opinions of the public will be lost which could have detrimental effects.

__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	I think that a comment section is necessary for engagement and exchange of ideas but having said that, there should be a code for AI embedded within that platform which will be able to detect hate speech or words classified as hate speech then the AI can delete them automatically. Also people can report the comment and the AI should delete the comment within minutes of it being reported.
__label__noRel	Hate speech is a probelm, and to discredit any potential help is not the answer. Trials and attempts could be made to fix this issue. A good way to do so would be to use human modetors who are netural, to ensure that there is fairness.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	online verification can create a more personal and tangible online persona in whch people feel accounatable and scrutinised	by checking what people comment befor approval
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	I think rather than removing the option to comment/debate below an article, there could be moderators and hate speech buttons and bots to keep hate speech at bay.
__label__noRel	I agree,the should be someone who's hired to check comment and to block.Also those who bully people shoul not be allowed on the site	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	yes. good moderators are the key	The only possible way to reduce hate speech is to have some kind of algorithm that may recognise certain words and phrases. Other than that it would mean moderating the comment section.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	I also think these should be monitored to a certain degree because hurtful comments can't be out there like they are currently	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	To ensure freedom of speech is still maintained, moderation needs to be carried out fairly. To achieve this, we need to understand what is hate speech and what are the lines that seperate that with constructive criticism. Attached is an article by the Standford encyclopedia of physiosphy regarding hate speech. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hate-speech/
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	the website should have terms and conditions on the words that can be used and warnings if failure to follow the recommended words .
__label__noRel	I think that people need to be able to post comments but not offend others so I think that it should be policed by the webiste or they need to consider AI to filter out bad comments	Asking people to identify themselves when doing their registration. If we remove the anonymous factor, people will be afraid to act like trolls.
__label__noRel	you admitted that this 'ain't true'. Although hate comments may not initially cause any physical harm, the psychological damage caused by hate comments is bad enough and can eventually lead to physical damage too.	Where is the evidence for this? There is no guarantee that people will give correct credentials. Also, who defines 'hate speech'? This is not as simple as you may believe.
__label__noRel	I agree	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I agree	"Freedom of Speech'...that's a popular consensus among the masses, regardless of the "casualities" that are left on the wayside. Having reread a lot of the comments posted here, I do consider the possibility of having people comment as they wish, politically correct or not. HOWEVER, let there be consequences involved, such as naming and shaming, and acquring user details if need be, after all, things such as cyber crime, online harrassment, etc do exist, am I right? And so, if such a comment borders on this, let it become a criminal matter and have law enforcement dealing specifically in cyber-related crimes become involved. Problem solved.
__label__noRel	just because readers comments should be allowed does not mean that they should not be filtered within some capacity to prevent hate speech and discriminatory comments	Maybe online newspapers can invest in text mining, where if hate speech is detected, the comment will not go through. Or, in the comments section, there could be a greyed message in the background that states a non-tolerance to hate speech.
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	but then how would that be any different to newspaper comments sections? the folk who write hateful comments would migrate to different platform, then you'd have the same problem just on a different platform.	by giving guide lines on the comment section
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	It is important that people are able to have a voice, especially as it can be a great tool in educating people, and giving people a variety of viewpoints that they wouldn't necessarily get to often hear. Sometimes we learn best by hearing and understanding the views of other people. We don't have to necessarily change our opinions, but it can help us become more aware of why or how people feel a certain way about things.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	Issues around hate speech bring into clear relief the emergence of private spaces for expression that serve a public function, this may lead to violence or non-radical behaviors for the public at large. The only possible way of reduction is for writers to not write or give out any opinions of hate speech. This will ensure that readers are comfortable.
__label__noRel	I totally agree.	"Freedom of Speech'...that's a popular consensus among the masses, regardless of the "casualities" that are left on the wayside. Having reread a lot of the comments posted here, I do consider the possibility of having people comment as they wish, politically correct or not.

__label__noRel	Evidence from research (see attached) suggests that the comments section of a news article is better at creating discussion than outside sources, so comment sections in newspapers is important for nuanced discussion	Hate speech is an attack, a threat, or prehudice speech.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	I think allowing some special space to allow it also would be helpful instead of cutting comments off.
__label__noRel	I like the idea of allowing readers to flag comments for future moderated review :-)	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	A very good point. So-called hate speech is often used by leftists to silence political opponents.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	allows the expression and discussion of points which could limit hate speech in itslef	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	We can reduce hate speech by having it moderated
__label__noRel	people will find a way to comment horrible things elsewhere in newspapers	You can let people create an account with a full name so they will have to think more about what they write and can't so easily spew hate
__label__noRel	Reductions in violations	But education and training and awareness are also needed, so people don't repeat what mistakes they have done in the past.
__label__noRel	Although people might abuse the flagging, however, if there are reviewers to do their work on those flags, these comments that have been flagged intentionally would not be removed.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	Without the option for comments, the news providers become the sole voice of an opinion.	I think all the hate speech my be removed before it is published on public
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	State that the editor is free to print or not print any comments, and his/hers is the final decision.
__label__noRel	Algorithms aren't that sophisticated. They might miss stuff, or label as hate speech something that isn't	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Filter comments or have a ban on words that come across as hateful.
__label__noRel	I definitely agree with what you are saying. I think a lot of hate speech and aggression starts when a user doesn't agree with your opinion and thinking their truth is the only truth.	There is no need to reduce hate speech, we just need to accept it. Banning or reducing hate speech is just censorship which is not acceptable.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Removing the comment section from online newspapers is not the answer. Allowing people to post their opinions is healthy and a normal part of human society- people will not always agree. However, in order to reduce hate speech, which can so often lead to crime, it could be done so that there are monitors (either human or computer) who check comments before they are posted to ensure they are not hate speech.
__label__noRel	making individuals aware	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	Alternatively I'd offer the opinion that goes against the question and states that we shouldn't offer a space for readers comments (and thus hate speech) at all on news since it's primarily a site and source for news. Systems like https://ground.news/ have been providing news and removing bias without a social aspect already and since third party social/sharing/commentary sites handle discussion and the problem of hate speech far better than newspaper websites presumably can hope to, the solution seems intuitive: remove it and let that happen organically on other websites and platforms.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	I think comments should be limited and all negative comments should be blocked
__label__noRel	even if it were criticism not all criticism is valid and should deserve a space	I agree with the notion that being able to share our thoughts and feelings is a right and having people share their views can help people to question their own thoughts. The inclusion of moderators to prevent people from posting discriminatory or harmful comments would be good, but difficult to ensure these moderators aren't biased towards one argument
__label__noRel	Privacy issues. I know that my information are already somehow online but no one would be willing to give them freely, with the risk of being persecuted.	This is an interesting article on the outcomes of several news agencies that disabled the comments section. Some of the writers of articles were getting subjected to abusive messages. This would be another argument for verified profiles only allowed to access the websites with their real names and details.
__label__noRel	It is the way to go. Hate speech should not be allowed a space in society	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	Exactly. Just ignore the hate speech. Like in real life you just ignore the bullies	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	Creates a platform for fake news	I am reminded while discussing this of the way Daily Mail in UK handles the comments section. It just mentions on top of the comments page that theses comments are not moderated.So it allows everybody to express their opionion. This is how it should be done in my opinion
__label__noRel	Yes, another way to only limit hate speech is to remove anonymity. Therefore, certain sites can require those to sign-up with their bio and this is verified by moderators. Someone may think twice about being 'hateful' if there are repercussions.	i think by just censoring specific words that are hateful/derogatory this could then automically screen out hateful comments that are abusive - i think it should be judged on what would be an offense to say in person. This could then use humans to read and monitor comment boards and then train AI to further do so
__label__noRel	I agree, its best to be respectfull whether you agree with an article or not.	The only possible way to reduce hate speech is to have some kind of algorithm that may recognise certain words and phrases. Other than that it would mean moderating the comment section.

__label__noRel	I agree with the statement, however in this article https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea they speak about different countries laws and UN laws. The difficulties in combatting hate speech on such a universal level is there is not a solid agreement from the world on what constitutes hate speech and how to combat it.	There should be some level of censoring to eliminate hate speech, but not to the extent where comments are totally disabled
__label__noRel	And we will get to keep our respectful viewers who knows that you still have disagreement without insulting others	Totally agree . Users all human beings after all
__label__noRel	Im not sure many people believe everything reporters report in the news. I know I don`t trust everything I read.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.

__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	I agree	Moderating comments is a far better method than eliminating comments entirely. I feel a method for reporting comments, though not perfect, is better, and then reported comments can be examined and removed if necessary.
__label__noRel	This will allow online users to think twice before spewing hate speech	Develop AI which is able to detect and delete hate speech automatically.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	It can be difficult to automate this monitoring	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	Cannot guarantee 100% data protection.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	Not so much swearing and negativity.	Awareness campaigns need to be implemented to teach people about the significance of avoiding hate speech.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	Newspapers and free speech functioned well for a couple of hundred years without instant comments. People used to write letters to the newspaper, including their name. The newspaper would then publish some letters anonymously. This meant that people were protected but offered well considered opinions, rather than abusive or nasty comments. Perhaps a slower postal system encourages better behaviour rather than an amplified Twitter-esque school-yard of bullying and abuse.
__label__noRel	I agree. The BBC has previously been reprimanded for only having one side of the climate change debate speak (denier vs scientist). The public should receive multiple points of view in a way that is balanced and evidence-based.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	I think all the hate speech my be removed before it is published on public
__label__noRel	too many opinions can be conflicting	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks.

Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	By using moderators or AI to police the posts
__label__noRel	the algorithm could be abused by users	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	Banning hate speech will radicalize people who will only feel more oppressed by the opposition trying to silence them.	people who comment hate speech should be banned
__label__noRel	This would reduce the risk of hate speech.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	I think this is a task that is hard to do because it has to be done in a way that would not hinder freedom of speech but at the same time not attack people. Thus, I think comments should be flagged depending on the words used but not be deleted until it has been checked.
__label__noRel	And we will get to keep our respectful viewers who knows that you still have disagreement without insulting others	Censor out words
__label__noRel	This will improve the language but not the other content	Hate speech is a form of self publicity. If the community isolates the perpetrators by flagging negative content that would be helpful. Flagged content would then need to be followed by banning perpetrators
__label__noRel	I think using AI would not prove to be very effective. If this AI was to be self-supervised (without any moderators) I think it would quickly start flagging not-hateful comments as hate speech since it's very susceptible to user input - see what happened to Microsoft's Twitter bot Tay. After a couple of weeks, if I'm not mistaken, the AI started posting very hateful tweets about the holocaust and minorities.	A possible way to address hate speech on newspaper sites would be to incorporate both human moderators and some sort of AI that monitors for hateful words and comments. The requirement to submit personally identifying information before commenting might also help because without this then anyone can create a fake name that hides the person's true identity so therefore more likely to engage in hate speech. If personal information is required, then hate speech would be less likely.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	By moderating the comment section. Instead of having an individual who may be biased in their moderation, the use of an artificial intelligence software can be introduced to moderate the comment section.
__label__noRel	I agree with both of these ideas. Having a moderation means consistency, but having other readers flag comments allows other commenters to hold peers to account and ensure that the comment section is an inclusive and fair section.	My position as a reader and my argument is that bases on the rules of speech people have freedom of speech and expression. That should be done in a proper way without insulting others or hating or being racist in your speech. Websites and newspapers should not remove the comments of the people responding to hate speech. This is done according to the rules found in the following article: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	The dangers of allowing free speech has been constantly seen in different moments. A recent time was when Donald Trump Instigated riots in America, causing damage to buildings and applauding it... making it worse and worse	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__noRel	Definitely, it can be very polarising in itself with a definition and cause more issue if the wrong thing is removed	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	monitored comment section	Comments are important as it can help create a balanced view and promote healthy discussion, maybe software could pick up on key words or phrases and then a moderator could look more in depth at questionable comments.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	Comment space encourages discussion of important topics and allows free exchange of information and so should not be eliminated. Independent moderators should be used in order to ensure that hate speech is quickly deleted and encourage users to express their ideas without using inappropriate or aggressive language.
__label__noRel	Possible infringment on data	by blocking users who violate 'hate speech rules', i feel it should be clearly stated what hate speech is.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Regulation of the newspaper comment section should be done. There should be moderators who have the ability to remove certain comments if they feel it is needed.
__label__noRel	Taking us to a reputable source.	Unfortunately, the public's view on acts of terrorism (including domestic) can be strongly swayed by the effective use of such innocent feeling things as comment sections, as these groups may flood such sections underneath reporting of their own acts with sympathetic or 'this isn't an issue' type posts, thus influencing others' opinions directly or indirectly.
__label__noRel	Yes however, it would at least stop the effect hate speech has on others	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	I strongly feel that comments are an essential part of the readers experience. It assists readers by giving them a broader sense and understanding of the topic being discussed. Removing them would be taking a way an integral part of that experience.
__label__noRel	I personaly like the General Policy Recommendation from the Council of Europe to this topic: https://www.coe.int/en/web/european-commission-against-racism-and-intolerance/recommendation-no.15	Hate speech is a problem but we do need to have debate. We need to respect different views and allow people to voice their opinion where necessary to further a debate on a news topic. Having the comments vetted before they appear does allow for some censorship but that must not be at the cost of open discussion.
__label__noRel	Because it's the only thing that could actually work	I think that education is the way to go about it, Humans must respect opposing views of others and tolerant society should be encouraged at all times instead of censorship
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	One of the problems with social media is the use of bots which dramatically wreak havoc with algorithms. It creates a technical imbalance and an environment that is less reality based and more echo chamber. Cleaning this up would be a huge start.	Our freedom to do anything as part of a society is limited. Thus freedom of speech should be no different. Poeple need to be held accountable for their mistakes, so everybody else's rights will be protected. So having a set of keywords which are not allowed to be used is a way of reminding the writter that using the offensive word he/she is trying to use is considered a crime. An additional way to handle that is having the flag option by users and a team of moderators who follow a standard and will verify if flagged comments should be maintained or not. Lastly, anonymity might bring a feeling of impunity and even its possibility, so a way to avoid that is allowing one profile per person/email, where a fake username can be set, but, in the backstage, the website will know who it is that wrote each comment.
__label__noRel	There needs to be some space to discuss the news to encourage conversation and fact checking.	I'm a firm supporter of freedom of speech but the internet as we all know can be a cruel place. A lot of individuals hide behind their screens and say things to people that they wouldn't have the guts to say in person given the opportunity. So with that being said I stand for the elimination of the space bar for readers.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	Allowing the readers to push a post out of air by flagging it could be just as easily abused by people to mass flag posts they dont like for political or personal reasons and create more problems than it solves	The technical team of the newspaper should select comments that don't promote hate speech and make those comments the only ones that are going to appear on the newspaper's websites.
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I think this is an invasion of privacy and the internet allows people to be the person they want to be and want to identify as - something they might not feel comfortable doing in real life.	This should be done with a mix of moderation, community flagging and reporting before moving to disabling comments, based ona mix of moderative judgement and amount of flagging
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	There should be a strict comment management system in place, someone has to supervise it and react (and possibly penalise) to users spreading hate speech. The comments should not be anonymous since people feel more inclined to be hostile when hiding under a pseudonym. Maybe asking to verify your identity before posting a comment would make people think more before spreading hate.
__label__noRel	Sometimes, in the context of a debate, aggressive language is necessarily to demonstrate the emotion of the people and their dissatisfaction	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	Newspapers can't be one sided, they should give a balanced, fair point of view	I don't believe removing the comment section will help remove hate speech, but having a system that can track the device and the people that use that device can go a long way in removing trolls from a community platform and prevent them from becoming repeat offenders.
__label__noRel	I think this is very important. Hate speech will drive away advertisers as they will not want to be associated with hateful comments. Newspapers will have to stop those comments to retain revenue.

__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	Hate speech invites violence and undermines people
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	The comments section can not create fake news. It may attract people with extreme views but not people making up news themselves.	The use of admins and moderators can be helpful in removing hate speech. They would need strict rules for the public in order to not let their own personal biases judge what is and isn't considered hate speech.
__label__noRel	i dont think is right	Freedom of speech still has its limits!!
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	You are right. it is the people who do not know, what they are taking about, they make problems	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	It is the best solution	Having certain words being banned or marked as inappropriate might help reduce hate speech. Systems that moderate what is being said and shared and the option to report hate speech might be helpful.

__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	I think everyone raised some good points already, but overall, it seems to be that some moderation is required no matter what, and that might be too costly for some smaller platforms to implement.
__label__noRel	b	Have something that sensors specific hate words and filter them out
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	I think that moderation is the most effective way of preventing hate speech. Filtering comments would not work as it is difficult to find a algorithm for the context of a comment. Free speech is so important it should not be removed.
__label__noRel	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	The only problem is that facts and hate can sometimes be intertwined together and a system cannot always distinguish it easily	we can do that by having strict rules on language and hate speech where one can be blocked from commenting or their comments gets removed if there is any negativity
__label__noRel	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button	With rights comes responsibility. We all have freedom of speech but it is our responsibility to ensure that our speech does not cause harm on others. If people do not want to be responsible in their speech, then their speech should be reduced because things have consequences. So, the hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by removing comments with hate speech or having a software that can identify hate speech in a comment before it is posted.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	online newspaper will definately attract a lot of people if there is comment section as some people prefer to go through comments first to get insight of the content.
__label__noRel	The removal of the comment gives a clear warning to contributors that hate speech is not tolerated and that if they use offensive language then their opinion will not be heard.	Could ensure moderation of commonly used words for hate speech, and frequent moderation on these websites
__label__noRel	I think it depends the level of "hate speech". This is very undefined and to subject it to the same level as a crime in "the real world" is a bit extreme. Otherwise I do agree moderation of what people say on social media is needed	If the aim is merely to reduce hate speech then I think eradicating the comment section goes too far. Why should people not be allowed to comment and have their say. The newspaper is punishing the public for the crimes of a few. It seems rather unfair. I think the best method is to have monitors.
__label__noRel	I agree, feelings should be left out when giving your views.	I'm not sure if it will work but they can put a sign on the website that says no to hate comments allowed. Or a report button can also help then administrator can review the reported comments
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	This article also discusses the use of moderators https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation	People should be allowed to say what they want. Other people can disagree - they should not allow themselves to be angered by opinions with which they disagree.
__label__noRel	I believe that punishment would cause more polarization because people may have more negative feelings towards newspaper websites with comments sections. Like what AllisonK said, education is a better preventative measure. If punishment is necessary, it should involve education that the commentator actively engages in.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	due to the changing world and the improvement of technology,the internet is like a black canvas and anyone can put anything they want on it,but even though technology is improving most websites dont use basic protection,they could do things like add comment filters,then this ensures that hateful words or phrases cannot be used but positive and informative words and statements can be
__label__noRel	I want to hear everyones opinion	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	Im not sure many people believe everything reporters report in the news. I know I don`t trust everything I read.	As I saw some commentary on this platform, my opinion is that we need 2 things. A submission of personal data before one can have access to post anything related and real time moderation of the comments. Big platforms like YouTube, Instagram and others are held accountable for their users' actions and they have had a lot of success so far. Source: https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/combat-online-hate-speech/
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	A pop-up can be used which reads "if any 'hate speech' comment is discovered, it will be removed from these comments".
__label__noRel	I do agree with education and raising awareness but what about bots and people who simply want to cause trouble?	I see that most people have the same idea as I have of having moderated. I did not think about what the guidelines could be and how censoring could be a contributing factor to my stand on having comments moderated, but it still seems like the best solution.
__label__noRel	I agree with this, this tools can be helpful in reducing hate speech	everyone should be entitled to comment and have opinions but the comment section should be checked and hate comments deleted and that user blocked on the website
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	I think using a platform which blocks out certain words, kind of like a filter would help. So if someone made a post with a certain word in, that post would not be made public, instead the comment would be flagged and go to a admin, who can read the comment and then decide if the 'bot' which flagged it was correct or not, and then deciding if to allow the post to be made or not
__label__noRel	If the cancel that section then where will we be able to say what we feel. They will be robbing us of our free speech.	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Some people just like to spread their negative vibes on strangers, not worried about serious consequences, as the worst thing that can happen to them is the comment being removed. There should be consequences!
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	Asking people to identify themselves when doing their registration. If we remove the anonymous factor, people will be afraid to act like trolls.
__label__noRel	I personaly like the General Policy Recommendation from the Council of Europe to this topic: https://www.coe.int/en/web/european-commission-against-racism-and-intolerance/recommendation-no.15	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	I agree	Websites need to be held accounbtable for hate speech
__label__noRel	More understanding	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	I have no real interest in reading readers comments sections in newspapers, but I don't agree that they should be eliminated. The content can be moderated to remove hate speech. This be done by a moderator, or these days, by AI.
__label__noRel	making individuals aware	You can ban some words, that usually helps a lot.
__label__noRel	I definitely agree on the part of sciencing valid criticism	As I saw some commentary on this platform, my opinion is that we need 2 things.

__label__noRel	I agree with the main idea, but people who spew hate speech aren't exactly open to being educated.	Completely removing the comment section is out of the question. How else is the audience supposed to interact with the material and each other? the feedback could be useful to the writer too for future articles pertaining to similar topics.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Ask people to be respectful and back-up their opinions factually. The danger, of course, is attaching URLs or info that themselves propagate misinformation by presenting it as fact.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	You can reduce hate speech by moderating the comments, banning repeating offenders and requiring a phone number to create a account.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information.

__label__noRel	This article summarises it well https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	I think certain people should be not allowed to share their opinions publicly because their only intention is to create hate and to upset people. Separately, society need to be educated on how to communicate via Social Media.
__label__noRel	does not have too many problems with the company	Moderating is good and maybe informing the person why their message was moderated so that they know and do better next time
__label__noRel	I like the idea of allowing readers to flag comments for future moderated review :-)	I think in order to eliminate hate speech, the comment section itself must be completely eradicated to take a way all potential risk. Newspapers have the sole purpose of giving accurate depictions of current events, there is no responsibility for them to offer social commentary space. One only has to look at the hatred filled comments of the Daily Mail web pages to see the concerning language being used on a regular basis.
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed.

__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	The idea that media should be able to stop a conversation is wrong and this is what would happen if comments were removed.
__label__noRel	WHile the definition in general can apply to most types of hate speech, there is one flaw, which can be illustrated by the following statement: "I don't care about your race, religion or gender. I do not like you because you are an idiot (or stupid)". Is that hate speech or an expression of opinion?	Addressing hate speech should not mean prohibiting freedom of speech which is what you will be doing if the comments' section is removed. Instead a way to reduce the hate speech from escalating into something dangerous must be sourced and implemented. https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/UN%20Strategy%20and%20Plan%20of%20Action%20on%20Hate%20Speech%2018%20June%20SYNOPSIS.pdf

Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	i dont believe eliminating the space for readers comments is the right thing, readers should be allowed to comment and moderators can be used to reduce harmful/hateful speech	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__noRel	who recruits these moderators, who chooses their criteria for what is hateful vs what's not?	Online comment spaces should be platforms promoting free speech, with some restrictions in place. Human or digital moderators (AI) could be used to identify comments and phrases constituting hate speech and remove them from the platform without hindering people's ability to share their authentic views.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	i agree that we still need readers comments but they should be filtered.	/?Are there ways to better police it and identify key words/phrases? Is there an automated moderator program?
__label__noRel	Companies will make more effort in regulating online presence if they are held accountable by law	having moderators approve comments
__label__noRel	The disadvantage of having free speech it causes people to think it is Ok to bully, lie or name call other people and this causes more chaos and leads to more hate which is not the path that most newspaper websites want.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	Freedom of speech can be used as catch-all term to justify the use and propagation of bigoted and hateful language. If we accept that some language is not acceptable due to it's clearly hateful nature then we have to acknowledge that some form of censorship of those particular instances has to occur. I would suggest that eliminating all such spaces from newspaper websites would have a massive detrimental effect on valid, non-bigoted, freedom of speech a cornerstone of western life. We don't ban all cars because some people speed dangerously, we monitor the roads and ban the bad drivers. I suggest that as long as readers comments are monitored continually they should remain.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	in my opinion there should be no comment section , article should be true and commenting no needed
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	The problem with allowing commentary to flourish without restrictions is that it can undermine the credibility of legitimate news sources. Frank Waddell, associate journalism professor at the University of Florida, noted that “If you see a bunch of individuals online who are leaving negative comments on a news article, you might think most people are evaluating this news as low quality,” Waddell said. “When asked to evaluate the news yourself, you might also think the news is more negative relative to someone who reads that same article without comments.” https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/	Although it might be unfair for others, I think majority can agree that removing the comment section will be helpful because then it means anyone that has an opinion can rather call the newspaper.
__label__noRel	This will eliminate hate speech	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	Newspapers in print have a comments section that you can write in to give your opinions on, but the replies are moderated and checked. Online versions should have the same ability, differences of opinion should be embraced not stopped and can be moderated to ensure no hate speech is written within those opinions.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	A reporting site that is accessible across all platforms would be a good start like https://www.report-it.org.uk/reporting_internet_hate_crime.
__label__noRel	I agree	What is characterised as hate speech needs to be assessed on a case by case basis. It is not absolute
__label__noRel	Gathering data in a specific area of online discussion like newspaper comment sections would probably reveal a lot about how online discourse turns to hate speech and how to tackle it as a problem. Maybe this task could be given to an independent or charitable institution, with the newspapers' cooperation?	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	it is true that an echo chamber is inevitable, so	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I agree	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	Yes, I think that readers can also downvote a comment or flag it so that it can be brought to the moderator's attention and they should take action within a specified time frame.	the best way is for companies to filter hate speech and remove it as long as the criteria for hate speech comes from an independent organisation. If companies themselves govern what is hate speech then we would become subject to there rules which you would lose the point of freedom of speech. Also there should be more support in the community for people who are being targeted in hate speech attacks.
__label__noRel	I agree	Have something that sensors specific hate words and filter them out
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem

__label__noRel	when hate speech encourages violence or discrimination against any specific class of people it should be removed regardless of how inoffensive an particular individual might find it	Maybe online newspapers can invest in text mining, where if hate speech is detected, the comment will not go through. Or, in the comments section, there could be a greyed message in the background that states a non-tolerance to hate speech.
__label__noRel	I think in the cases of newspapers, the hateful comments can be removed before print. If it's an online platform then said user can be shadowed	moderating the comments
__label__noRel	I agree	you should autoban key hate speech words
__label__noRel	I agree having an algorithm to delete specific words and phrases.	Hate speech online absolutely must be eliminated and we should not encourage it within online platforms. Hate speech can and does lead to violence which is more severe than 'being horrible online'. https://www.coe.int/web/european-commission-against-racism-and-intolerance/hate-speech-and-violence
__label__noRel	yes free speech should be protected	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards.

__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	Agreed. No allowing the public to share their views only allows the publication to share information without being challenged and I don't think that's fair. There should at least be room for engagement and debate by the public.

__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	Proper moderation that does not tolerate racist, sexist or any other discriminating behavior or hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Our freedom to do anything as part of a society is limited. Thus freedom of speech should be no different. Poeple need to be held accountable for their mistakes, so everybody else's rights will be protected. So having a set of keywords which are not allowed to be used is a way of reminding the writter that using the offensive word he/she is trying to use is considered a crime. An additional way to handle that is having the flag option by users and a team of moderators who follow a standard and will verify if flagged comments should be maintained or not. Lastly, anonymity might bring a feeling of impunity and even its possibility, so a way to avoid that is allowing one profile per person/email, where a fake username can be set, but, in the backstage, the website will know who it is that wrote each comment.
__label__noRel	not focusing on the interconnection between free speech and hate crime	I do not think it is possible, in a fair and just way. When speech is restricted that's called censorship. Who would justify the restrictive opinion?
__label__noRel	Hate speech is complex and jubjective. AI is still developing and not good enough to understand basic debate let alone interpret language, Too easy for AI to take words out of context.	Despite our general right to freedom of speech, hate speech remains inextricably linked to hate crimes and intolerance. A hard stance should be taken by newspapers against hate speech, utilising moderators to remove hateful comments, despite the fact that it could be construed as a restriction on free speech.
__label__noRel	I see where you're coming from, but if someone is just posting racist words, then their comment should be removed. If the commenter is intelligent and using reasoning in the form of putting out their point, explaining it, then providing evidence. Then regardless of the bias, I'm sure most moderators should let that go. I think people aren't that stupid.	By using a tool to search for hate speech
__label__noRel	Agreed	I think one way of eliminating hate speech is to filter the comment section by certain words that are considered hateful. We obviously can not control what people do but by filtering the comment section we can limit what people can and can not say.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	There should be serious repercussions against hate speech
__label__noRel	I have to agree with DamianC above, I notice a lot of hate speech on twitter for example and I feel this would if anything create more problems as they would have zero control over the platform.	as long as good moderators are in place, hate speech and disrespectful comments will be weeded out.
__label__noRel	Yes, I totally agree with this. Actually, I think this might be the solution to this problem. If comments are moderated before they go public then there is no chance that offensive and inappropriate comments will make it to the public comments section.	I think there should be moderators on articles that make the comments. less visible so offensive comments can have a warning before viewing
__label__noRel	This would help the content management team not have to answer every mail about comments.	I think that the introduction of moderators to remove any hate speech would be beneficial. Perhaps the introduction of guidelines as to what constitutes permitted negative comments.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	It has been shown that comments sections are popular and do drive traffic to websites and make people spend more time on the site (so pleasing advertisers) So from a commercial/publishing point of view it would seem that some kind of moderation is the best way to deal with the problem and not eliminate the section altogether. (See https://webpublisherpro.com/your-website-needs-a-comments-section/)
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	The problem is that hate speech laws differ from country to country. The UN has a set of rules (https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech?gclid=Cj0KCQjw48OaBhDWARIsAMd966B8prXQ12vsyA9iPNzeoJiBpSFAuLJFh4j4_h5QJe48gd8MVKZ4eHQaAiPWEALw_wcB) but that does not mean all countries obey and follow them. Taking away opinion from topics would mean you would not know how other feel about an topic or article all in the name of hate speech. Therefore, it would create a miss understood society.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	I don't think we should rely on AI or algorithms to safeguard comment sections. Algorithms are only as reliable as the coding, and that is done in total darkness.	hate speech must be clearly defined, it should not be left to the media to decide what is and is not considered hate speech
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be damaging. Removing it also gives the platform more professionality	There should be a strict comment management system in place, someone has to supervise it and react (and possibly penalise) to users spreading hate speech. The comments should not be anonymous since people feel more inclined to be hostile when hiding under a pseudonym. Maybe asking to verify your identity before posting a comment would make people think more before spreading hate.
__label__noRel	It is absolutely true!	Algorithms are a must to cut out hate speech. Allowing only paying subscribers is elitist but necessary as being traceable is important.
__label__noRel	However a view point can be expressed appropriately as a constructive criticism by the target audience. Therefore you could argue that anyone who engages in hate speech is the wrong audience.	news media can look into AI technology to solve such problems.the machine will detect faul speeach and instantly hide or delete the comment ,then send a warning to the post writer
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	readers comments be moderated and anything that is harmful, hateful or hurtful should be removed. this allows people to exercise their right of freedom of speech but limiting the harm that someones opinion may have
__label__noRel	This is a horribly uninformed and unnecessarily inflammatory opinion, EmilyN. Are you saying that people who want to target, insult, and threaten others should be more protected that the people who are being threatened (i.e. the victims)? Just food for thought.	There should be ways to monitor the type of language used, perhaps through AI. It should be able to pick up key words related to hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree with moderation and the need for education and increased open-mindedness and respect	by giving guide lines on the comment section
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	Is it really hate speech or is it just an opinion that we don't want to hear?
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	I think the comment sections still need to be a respectful safe place to share your opinions. Free speech can be communicated in respectful way and still get your point/opinion across	I totally agree that hate speech should be limited as some readers do not take it lightly and may harm themselves after reading. I have heard stories about people ending their lives after their stories which often are embarassing are published, and the situation made worse by the comment section.
__label__noRel	I agree we can work to prevent it, but systems can be complicated to introduce or can be controversial in themselves	This should be done with a mix of moderation, community flagging and reporting before moving to disabling comments, based ona mix of moderative judgement and amount of flagging
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	Newspaper websites should invest more in technology that can be used to detect hate speech and not allow it to be posted. They should only allow comments posted in the language that the software will understand so that it is able to eliminate hate speech without difficulties. they should also be willing to punish people who post hate speech by reporting them to the authorities.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Moderating comments could be a viable solution. The use of AI could make it easier given that there could be thousands and thousands of comments, too much for human moderator/s to keep track of.
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	Not allowing anonymous posts as well would force individuals to process comments internally before publishing on a public platform.
__label__noRel	Thats why its best to have set rules. Like swear language, certain words, threats and stuff like that but anything that is just opinion should be allowed no matter if you disagree or don't like what is said.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	every online space should have moderation its weird that this is even a discussion	I think an AI that could identify some keyword related with hate speech would be helpful to flag that comment and allow further review
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	we should keep comment sections on newspaper websites but we should have moderators to filter out any hate speech
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Newspaper websites can eliminate space for readers comments for articles that they think are more likely to receive more hate speech
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	Regulation of the newspaper comment section should be done. There should be moderators who have the ability to remove certain comments if they feel it is needed.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	By not providing comment section not unless the article need their opinion. There'll be a note notifying readers to be well mannered.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	We should have a clear definition for hate speech in order to regulate the comment section. For example, comments suggesting certain groups be harmed or should not exist, and language that suggests these groups are inferior without providing educational evidence. We need to keep the comment section a place of discussion and education.
__label__noRel	Freedom of speech is important, if we remove comments we remove other perspectives. Not all comments are hate speech	State that the editor is free to print or not print any comments, and his/hers is the final decision.
__label__noRel	I agree	Hate speech must be eliminated. The only way to do this thoroughly is with human moderation.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	I think newspapers should not take away the comment section. Firstly this is unfair to all the people who want to have their say and should be able to do so Dominicis wrong
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	After doing some follow up reading from https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/what-is-online-hate-crime/ I have seen how the anonymity of these online comments can be what makes it so easy for people to be hateful. Therefore, an easy solution would be to make it impossible for people to comment anonymously, and have people have to provide personal information. However, I am not sure how this would work from a data protection point of view. It is certainly a start.
__label__noRel	I think the only way to stop this would be to review all comments before they are published and delete anything that is hate speech.	Again I think that removing comment sections entirely would overall be a negative thing. Yes, there are people who abuse the comments section and it they can use it to promote hate speech, but with the right tools this could be moderated. Removing comment sections entirely leaves us with a lack of space for healthy discussion and debate, new ideas and opportunities for learning
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	As I saw some commentary on this platform, my opinion is that we need 2 things. A submission of personal data before one can have access to post anything related and real time moderation of the comments. Big platforms like YouTube, Instagram and others are held accountable for their users' actions and they have had a lot of success so far. Source: https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/combat-online-hate-speech/
__label__noRel	Being open to the voice of the opposition means that we can hear another side of the argument	I think people should be able to express their feelings, but there should be a way to block hate speech
__label__noRel	I agree	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	I believe that newspaper articles know the consequences of any article they put up and the kind of comments that may arise from such, it is therefor their responsibility to prevent such from occuring.	Despite our general right to freedom of speech, hate speech remains inextricably linked to hate crimes and intolerance. A hard stance should be taken by newspapers against hate speech, utilising moderators to remove hateful comments, despite the fact that it could be construed as a restriction on free speech.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	I agree with this, as the issue of moderating newspaper comments also crosses the gap into social media where most newspapers will post their articles too.	Asking for their constructive criticism and how it will benefit the individual and community.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Allow others users to rate the comments and block those who receive bad ratings
__label__noRel	I dont think you can use all means necessary to eradate hate speech. You can only control how you react to it	Holding platforms responsible for all content they publish would help
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	We need very close moderation as this in all likelihood is the best way to ensure hate speech does not spread, human interaction is key as algorithms do not do a very good job
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	Increasing the monitoring of comments made on a post will prevent the propagation of dangerous viewpoints and scams performed on people as no control over the content published create spaces for this to take place.
__label__noRel	That is an interesting point. It would need to be an impartial party. I know sometimes FB and other social media platforms use algorithms to hide certain posts (usually due to language) so maybe that could be one answer?	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	I think you are confusing hate speech with a controversial opinion. Hate speech would be saying a racist word 5 times; a controversial opinion would be that dinosaurs don't exist because of the square cube law.	Hate speech is an attack, a threat, or prehudice speech.
__label__noRel	People want to comment about what they've just read on the newspaper, they don't want to go to an external source to talk about it. Why would it be any better sending people elsewhere to do this? There must be a way to educate people as a way to prevent hate speech.	Hate speech is so prevalent nowadays that proper measures should be taken in order to limit these harmful comments. However to stop people from expressing their opinions is creating another problem altogether. Those who aren't able to make help contributions should be blocked and stripped of their right to do so.
__label__noRel	IT is absoluety the websites job to police polirising comments if nesccearry to keep peace wihthin the outiside community viewing their newspapers.	In order to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. Active communinty management and moderation is required. This helps keep people in line with the community guildelines.
__label__noRel	hate speech will take over the comment section. it is as the website owner to instate policies.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	I agree with that. We shouldn't incentive hate speech.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others.

__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	The only problem is that facts and hate can sometimes be intertwined together and a system cannot always distinguish it easily	Stop calling it hate speech maybe it is just another opinion
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	Moderation is necessary. Closing comments is not the answer, as communication can help people to understand each other's viewpoints. If you take comments away because you're afraid of hate speech, you're going to be creating a barrier between you and your audience.
__label__noRel	comments can dilute the validity of the story	hate speech is a reflection of two sides of a story ,all side of the story need to be published to allow the public to make up their own minds .
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	there is a difference between hate speech and an opposite view	user logins can allow for better regulation of comments
__label__noRel	Agree	I strongly feel that comments are an essential part of the readers experience. It assists readers by giving them a broader sense and understanding of the topic being discussed. Removing them would be taking a way an integral part of that experience.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	Charactertisation of hate speech should be done case-by-case, rather than applied universally
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?

__label__noRel	I would love to think that we could screen every comment written about every article but it is simply not realistic. Removing the platform that gives power to hate comments is the best solution. I understand that people want free speech, but i do not see this idea manifesting seamlessly	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way.

The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is often used as a reason not to have readers comments. It seems that this is not a fair argument for eliminating readers comments because of the psychological phenomenon of "cognitive dissonance" - we automatically search for echo chambers in any context.

__label__noRel	b	Many people are against the reducing of hate speech from newspaper article, and I am with them on this. The main reason for putting comment section on newspaper websites was for readers to leave a comment, people will always have something to say whether it is good or bad. But AI can still be used to remove comments that can be severely harmful.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	moderating the comments would surely help
__label__noRel	If you disagree with how they run their websites, run your own website.	allow people to say what they feel
__label__noRel	Hi Fabio, I believe you are absolutely right. Comments should definitely be allowed but under some kind of regulation. Not all comments are useful or relevant.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	Im not sure moderation would be the difinitive solution	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	i think this is correct but i do feel that there is more that technology can do to help these days too	Having read all of the previous discussion surrounding this debate, I still stand by my original opinion. Moderating comments by an official representative of the newspaper doesn't allow for free speech. We do however, need to eliminate hate speech. I think the best way to do this is to put this in the hands of the community and other readers.
__label__noRel	If journalistss are allowd hteir view and opinion which in many instances can be objecive, public should defientley be allowed to shar theirs, since ournalists are there to promot information and possibly dialogue as well	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	Could be successful in reducing hate speech and controlling potentially harmful hate speech.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	I am pretty sure some sort of hate speech itself is an infringement of ones human right and somehow defies what democracy stands for so it still does not lead to the necessary democracy either	/?Are there ways to better police it and identify key words/phrases? Is there an automated moderator program?
__label__noRel	Yes, I would be much more likely to post, read and respond to comments on a website location that is moderated and checked before posting	By having an administrator who is able to monitor any comment posted, and removing hateful speech and giving warning to hateful viewers
__label__noRel	There could be a risk with this. In an article from 2016 (https://www.jstor.org/stable/44014621) Flaxman et al. make the following point in their abstract: 'the vast majority of online news consumption is accounted for by individuals simply visiting the home pages of their favorite, typically mainstream, news outlets'. If this is the case, it's possible that the 'diverse' opinions will be in a cycle of one sided shared opinions, and few 'other' or opposed opinions. These could well end up being quite extreme, and the policy to include other opinions could well serve the opposite function of promoting hate speech when it is a massive minority.....maybe.	i agree that removing comments about hate speech is not the way to go
__label__noRel	people should be heard	comments should be allowed on newspaper articles so that people can have a discussion and express their opinions, regulation would ultimately ensure that everything is kept in order.

__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	With rights comes responsibility. We all have freedom of speech but it is our responsibility to ensure that our speech does not cause harm on others. If people do not want to be responsible in their speech, then their speech should be reduced because things have consequences. So, the hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by removing comments with hate speech or having a software that can identify hate speech in a comment before it is posted.
__label__noRel	Less hate speech	Asking people to identify themselves when doing their registration. If we remove the anonymous factor, people will be afraid to act like trolls.
__label__noRel	totally agree	Is it necessary to have readers comments? What do they add to the article?
__label__noRel	I agree	you can add an AI system in the website that will scan all comments instantly after they have been posted and it can remove any hate speech before it is seen by many people on the comment section, this method is used by some online communication platforms.
__label__noRel	Removing readers comments removes the users freedom of speech which is a basic human right	by just making the section smaller and have trasparency with dooing so
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry.

Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	I think by blocking certain terms that are hateful when responding to others in comments i.e., you are an idiot, loser etc. Hate speech should not be present online.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	We need people to supply their personal details in order to limit hate speech
__label__noRel	I think it depends the level of "hate speech". This is very undefined and to subject it to the same level as a crime in "the real world" is a bit extreme. Otherwise I do agree moderation of what people say on social media is needed	People should be members with addresses checked
__label__noRel	Young people can be eliminated, who are likely to hate speech because of lack of information.	Companies aswell as the users should be liable and held accountable for allowing a platform to be used to share hate speech
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	In my opinion the comment section should not be removed. I personally get very annoyed if I watch or read something and want to express my opinion, then go down to the comment section to sadly find out the comments are turned off. This limits the freedom of speech and blocks the ability for the people to vent out somehow. I think this builds aggression and causes problems afterwards. The better thing to do is to limit bad speech, foul words and cursing but removing the comments completely is not a good idea.
__label__noRel	Not necessarily. I think opinions are okay but not when it is hate and discrimination. Thinking morally that is wrong and shouldn't be allowed on any type of platform.	Filter the comments so that any with known hate speech terms cant be posted. Make sure people sign in to make comments etc
__label__noRel	Hate speech should be considered as a crime and people who promote or do hate should save time	There should be some filters to remove bad comments
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Freedom of speech should be always encouraged	hate speech is inevitable
__label__noRel	when regulating the comments someone will always disagree or challenge the rules. Claim free speech has gone mad etc.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	My final argument is that it is possible to monitor and reduce hate speech on website comments by using both AI and human intelligence
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	Hate speech does more harm than good
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	have an AI to scan and analyse trigger words, then the alert is passed to a human reviewer then can say whether or not it's hate speech
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	Disabling comments reduces free speech and makes everything monitored and authorised - then you have to question who is controlling what we see?
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	Having a comments section can be ideal to engage in a healthy debate but will need to monitored very strictly to ensure there is no bullying or one sided views be taken against any individuals
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	I think filtering hate speech comments can do that and allowing a better more positive and a welcome experience to all readers.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	only likes and dislikes are enough	I believe that with real time moderation , if the comments can be removed before causing any distress to people then this is a better option than removing the ability to make comments.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	This article describes how censoring might lead users to leave platforms and join other platforms with lighter censoring rules https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/global-extremes/does-censoring-radical-right-social-media-work/
__label__noRel	Whilst I agree, not when people are spewing hate and creating a hateful echo chamber.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	True, but people take freedom of speech and it gives them the right to say whatever they want, without fear of persecution	Be more strict when allowing people to create profiles, that require identification before allowing anybody to comment. Stopping people being anonymous enough to feel confident while posting hate speech I think will be more beneficial than restricting peoples comments.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	Such algorithms can be completely customized. For example: any posts containing a list of any key words can be prevented from posting.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	it also highlights the wider problem in society	The power of newspapers is too strong and needs to be restricted , moderation of the comments section is needed linked with non anonymous posting of mcomments
__label__noRel	We should try and make the internet a more welcoming place.	Newspapers should be a pleasure to read and not make you angry after reading comments not having comments will make them more pleasurable to read again.
__label__noRel	Banning hate speech cannot be a form of censorship if the views your express incite hate or violoence against other groups.	What is characterised as hate speech needs to be assessed on a case by case basis. It is not absolute
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	readers comments be moderated and anything that is harmful, hateful or hurtful should be removed. this allows people to exercise their right of freedom of speech but limiting the harm that someones opinion may have
__label__noRel	Yes 100%	Allow users to report comments.
__label__noRel	Should reduce Trolls	I see that most people have the same idea as I have of having moderated. I did not think about what the guidelines could be and how censoring could be a contributing factor to my stand on having comments moderated, but it still seems like the best solution.
__label__noRel	information	It can be done by using algorithms
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	If comments that create hate speech are removed/moderated, you can not complain about loss of freedom of speech as you are then being discrimantory, rather than speaking freely, and there is a difference.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	It goes further than this. We live in a society that has a lot of cry babies. We need to be impervious to negative comments from strangers on a social platform and that is anonymous. Most people need to grow a pair, develop a spine or stop being cry babies. Once this is achieved you will see that any contribution you make to a discussion will be debated in a civilized manner.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	Hate speech can mean different things to different people
__label__noRel	While I see the logic to this argument, the publics interaction with paper newspapers and slower press looks to have declined according to this article, therefore I'm not sure this solution would work: https://clubs.waketech.edu/wake-review/magazine/creative-writing/non-fiction/the-decline-in-newspapers-a-closer-look-joseph-ahrens/	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	I think certain people should be not allowed to share their opinions publicly because their only intention is to create hate and to upset people. Separately, society need to be educated on how to communicate via Social Media.
__label__noRel	Newspapers have a duty of care to the reader so they should be vigilant	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	modrate what can be posted before it allowed to be published finally
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	It would be hard for anyone to not be bias as we have different opinions on subjects and one might thing that the comment is appropriate and someone else might not think so. It can be subjective at times.	you must run a bot system that will automatically detect and remove posts with mature language
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__noRel	I agree	Increasing the monitoring of comments made on a post will prevent the propagation of dangerous viewpoints and scams performed on people as no control over the content published create spaces for this to take place.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	There is enough negativity in this world at the moment without adding to it with hate speech!	There needs to be a moderator who is reviewing the comments that are made, I see a lot of inappropriate comments posted to news stories on the comments section of the news articles on facebook that incite arguments and hate speech. This is not acceptable and should not be allowed to happen.
__label__noRel	there is no hate speech	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Hate speech can be positive criticism and essential in some posts, altgough it can be offensive and totally uncalled for in other posts. A way in which social media apps regulate and monitor the comments, otherwise people have rights to freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	Before an opinion is published it must be moderated and if it contains hate speech then the writer will not be able to post it.
__label__noRel	The drawback here is that people get carried away and be verbally aggressive and use foul language which doesn't go well with most of the readers who come to view the news and some of the healthy discussions in the comment section. But, all they find it few people engaging in a verbal war which is uncalled for.	You can moderate and that way delete hate speech. This won't get rid of freedom of speech but gets rid of discrimination etc https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech
__label__noRel	It may lead to an underground subculture or racists, homophobes who avoid this format	I believe that people are allowed to express their opinions , that is why we have freedom of speech. However with that right, we are not subjected to hate speech, there are so many ways of expressing yourself without using offensive or hateful words. Considering a newspaper is a public platform, I believe everyone should try to be respective at all times. The comment space must not be removed, it helps to get insights of readers and is very helpful. I think the website should be enhanced in a way that it detects offensive language and doesn't allow the reader to continue if they use such. Also, comments should be monitored before being posted to the public.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	Moderation is key. Plenty of newspapers and online media are able to keep comments open with a bit of moderation.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	comment sections should not be removed as that will prevent those with positive comments form sharing their thoughts, they should instead be reviewed regulary so that hate speech is flagged and removed another solution is for comments to be approved by moderators before they go public
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Just don't write about it
__label__noRel	I think that people should be given the opportunity to have free speech but with people who are paid to moderate comments. Free speech should also include people being given the opportunity to say things others do not agree with as long as it is not promoting a violent crime to be committed against someone.	Everyone is entitled to freedom of speech but hate speech can be detrimental to readers and the topics mental health. I think the best way to deal with hate speech is to have filtered comments, raising awareness and age restrictions on wensites and comment sections
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	i dont think is right	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	Free speech is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it is necessary for an effective democratic society and on the other hand, people tend to abuse the right. Newspapers and publishing companies are major symbols of free speech, however, and there will always be disadvantages to be endured, hate speech inclusive. The solution is not to disable comment spaces but to continually implore and push for cooperation amongst readers.
__label__noRel	I totally agree with this statement.	I agree with the notion that being able to share our thoughts and feelings is a right and having people share their views can help people to question their own thoughts. The inclusion of moderators to prevent people from posting discriminatory or harmful comments would be good, but difficult to ensure these moderators aren't biased towards one argument
__label__noRel	I disagree, comment sections allow the public to engage with the news and find people similar to them	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	Yes 100%	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	I definitely agree with your position, a certain level of regulation is needed, as looking at the current situation there are still many problems regarding online comments.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	I also agree because reading what people thinks about your work or your outlet is important. if not then how could the writer improve?	Ensuring there are rules to adhere to, perhaps muting certain offensive words or phrases. Making sure commnect sections are heavily monitored.
__label__noRel	It is difficult to determine what is considered hate speech as everyone has their own biases	Agreed
__label__noRel	Whilst I think that removing comments wouldn't fix hate speech, surely it would definitely diminish it and isn't that better than no solution at all?	Allow for a voting system on the comments, so as the cream rises to the top and the dredges sink away.
__label__noRel	I agree to some extent. I think there are some obvious exceptions but otherwise anytime someone disagrees they can say they find it offensive or hateful and want it removed. You can't exist in a happy thoughts only bubble	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	I strongly feel that comments are an essential part of the readers experience. It assists readers by giving them a broader sense and understanding of the topic being discussed. Removing them would be taking a way an integral part of that experience.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way.

Advanced AI is the ultimate answer. It is the cheapest and most unbiased moderator option.

__label__noRel	be responsible of your words	Hate comments are always not good for any person
__label__noRel	I think it would just become full of comments from people who were writing things just to get a reaction - feeding the trolls!	People should be told about hate speech and how it affects other people and I think people who participate in hate speech should have some sort of panishment.
__label__noRel	I agree, if we were to allow the public to have 'freedom of speech' We need to ensure someone who is unbiased can remove the comments that will only fuel hatred and not give a well structured opinion a chance.	Again I think that removing comment sections entirely would overall be a negative thing. Yes, there are people who abuse the comments section and it they can use it to promote hate speech, but with the right tools this could be moderated. Removing comment sections entirely leaves us with a lack of space for healthy discussion and debate, new ideas and opportunities for learning
__label__noRel	Someone's belief that a marginalised group doesn't deserve rights is far different from having a different opinion on something like the ending of a loved TV show. It should not be the responsibility of those hurt from harmful rhetoric to "be the bigger person" and ignore it when it has been proven that hate speech leads to acts of extreme violence	Freedpn of speech doesnt mean you must promote hate speech on newspapers, it basically means you free to voice out your concerns in around society in a more respectfull manner.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	I think if all comments go under review for hate speech, that should still allow a chance for hate speech comments to be retracted
__label__noRel	Could exclude nasty comments	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	Instead of removing the comment section newspapers can try and look up new and different ways to facilitate their reader engagement.
__label__noRel	I agree this would helpfilter some of the hate speech	I believe the comment section should be open to all to express their opinions.We need freedom of speech. Hate speech can be ignored. But it is important to show the view of all.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	There needs to be proper moderation of comments so that no hate speech slips through the net. This would make more work for the newspapers but would only require one person to constantly monitor what is being submitted and only allow reasonable comments.
__label__noRel	save a lot of hate speech being publicized.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.

__label__noRel	Hate speech must be moderated otherwise we are teaching future generation that is it acceptable	i think people need to be educated better about what Hate Speech is.
__label__noRel	Yes, I think this is the right approach	By simply monitoring the comments and blocking the negative ones and removing them
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Advanced AI is the ultimate answer. It is the cheapest and most unbiased moderator option.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	People will always spew hate speech and regulating it may be difficult to do. Freedom of speech should prevail therefore eliminating the comments section would be wrong. The newspaper site may have an automation that identifies hate words and whenever these appear the comment should be hidden from the comments section.
__label__noRel	It's actually not : https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated.

__label__noRel	Reduces the amount of troll comments	Where is the evidence for this? There is no guarantee that people will give correct credentials. Also, who defines 'hate speech'? This is not as simple as you may believe.
__label__noRel	Fixing the root cause would be most beneficial.	I think we can do this by having comments sufficiently moderated and removed if needed if they are producing hate speech.
__label__noRel	Definitely, it can be very polarising in itself with a definition and cause more issue if the wrong thing is removed	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	It is the way to go. Hate speech should not be allowed a space in society	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	the problem is that people are not happy and that has a reason	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	Removing readers comments removes the users freedom of speech which is a basic human right	I think that fully blocking comments being allowed is detrimental to free speech, therefore comments should be allowed. However, there should be monitoring and banning of certain individuals if they are found to be continually hateful towards others.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.

However if the comments were to still be present i think an idea would be to mute comments that incite any type of hate.
__label__noRel	good way to make a point	Hate speech is a form of self publicity. If the community isolates the perpetrators by flagging negative content that would be helpful. Flagged content would then need to be followed by banning perpetrators
__label__noRel	But hate speech hurts. We can't let it just run rife because it's "too hard" to address.	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?

__label__noRel	What if the moderators are biased themselves?	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	It has been shown that comments sections are popular and do drive traffic to websites and make people spend more time on the site (so pleasing advertisers) So from a commercial/publishing point of view it would seem that some kind of moderation is the best way to deal with the problem and not eliminate the section altogether. (See https://webpublisherpro.com/your-website-needs-a-comments-section/)
__label__noRel	If the accurate information is given.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	The comment section needs to be moderated using some kind of filter to automatically filter any words on the banned list and then use a report system to flag up anything which tries to bypass this.

__label__noRel	Makes sense	By using a tool that searches for likely words: hate, etc.
__label__noRel	c onsidering that information, and the hate speech which is still on Facebook - is AI able to work effectively?	"Freedom of Speech'...that's a popular consensus among the masses, regardless of the "casualities" that are left on the wayside. Having reread a lot of the comments posted here, I do consider the possibility of having people comment as they wish, politically correct or not. HOWEVER, let there be consequences involved, such as naming and shaming, and acquring user details if need be, after all, things such as cyber crime, online harrassment, etc do exist, am I right? And so, if such a comment borders on this, let it become a criminal matter and have law enforcement dealing specifically in cyber-related crimes become involved. Problem solved.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	People will always spew hate speech and regulating it may be difficult to do. Freedom of speech should prevail therefore eliminating the comments section would be wrong. The newspaper site may have an automation that identifies hate words and whenever these appear the comment should be hidden from the comments section.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	By simply educating people about what harm hate speech can do to a person
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	Regulation of the newspaper comment section should be done. There should be moderators who have the ability to remove certain comments if they feel it is needed.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	Filter the comments so that any with known hate speech terms cant be posted. Make sure people sign in to make comments etc
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	every comment submitted by readers must be checked internally for hate speech
__label__noRel	I disagree - people should comment where it is appropriate but not on topics where the public is largely misinformed or can spread misinformation such as climate change. Comments on topics like celebrities are ok because they ultimately don't matter when compared to an important science-policy debate.	A moderated comments section can solve this problem. Freedom of speech does not need to include hate speech. An opinion can be given that doesn't include hate speech in it.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	Filter the comments so that any with known hate speech terms cant be posted. Make sure people sign in to make comments etc
__label__noRel	I disagree with this to an extent, in order to have an open debate, both sides would have to be coming at the issue from a similarly open minded position, which realistically is not going to happen.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	I still think a filtering system of removing categorically hateful words could help a little, but there is still the big problem of other comments bypassing that. I think an independant and unbiased moderation team could help to remove the issue of the newspapers removing valid critisism or comments about inaccurate reporting for example.
__label__noRel	Less consumers/readers/	I think all the hate speech my be removed before it is published on public
__label__noRel	It isn't perfect but it is a pretty decent %	Hate speech will forever be a problem in society and its up to the newspapers website to make sure they publish newsworthy news that even if they come across negative comments, they know that on their side their story is true and there a no loopholes
__label__noRel	i dont think is right	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	It must me a government's responsibility to implement policies against hate speech.https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-to-combat-fake-news-and-disinformation/
__label__noRel	This is a fair point -- maybe removing the influence of comment sections altogether will stop the trend of news increasingly becoming 'comment' and being less objective in reporting. If people want to exercise their free speech about the article's content, they can still share the article and express their opinions on it elsewhere, like on their personal social media channels.	If comments that create hate speech are removed/moderated, you can not complain about loss of freedom of speech as you are then being discrimantory, rather than speaking freely, and there is a difference.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	I think that only people who provided identifying information can post their opinions. Also I agree that there should be AL tools to prevent hate speech. Eliminating hate speech from newspaper websites has nothing to do with the infringement of the free speech right.
__label__noRel	I'm not convinced this is a helpful input in its own way.	Limit anonymity in public discussions and employ a system of moderation.
__label__noRel	the writer will not feel disheartened	human rights of the masses should not be violated regardless of their beliefs and views
__label__noRel	Unfortunately, we are way to late for this. The internet has been used for more than 20 years and it's getting worse. Hate speech does a lot of damages and we need to act quickly because it causes a lot of harm for several groups of people, ethnic groups, etc.	Is it necessary to have readers comments? What do they add to the article?
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	The comment section needs to be moderated using some kind of filter to automatically filter any words on the banned list and then use a report system to flag up anything which tries to bypass this. This will allow a human moderator to quickly decide what can be kept and what needs action.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	There absolutely are ways to facilitate healthy conversation and debates without allowing hate speech. Both algorithms and human moderation are ways to ensure debate can continue without resorting to abuse.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	This makes sense, agreed	you can add an AI system in the website that will scan all comments instantly after they have been posted and it can remove any hate speech before it is seen by many people on the comment section, this method is used by some online communication platforms.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Agreeing with others here: a standard of moderation would have to be communicated to the user, with straightforward policies of flagging or reporting potentially hateful comments. A synthesis of live and algorithmic moderators might be best, as certain words can be auto-flagged for review, whereas other things might involve a more delicate touch.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__noRel	I agree	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	True. At the end of the day, the publisher controls what is published	One way I propose to prevent hate speech is to remove anonymity online. Not being able to hide should limit cowardly behavior and thus reduce harmful speech.
__label__noRel	This works in terms of removing literal slurs from the platform, but doesn't account for when hate speech is more well-disguised or nebulous - how could we expect an automatic system to understand a dogwhistle?	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__noRel	In my opinion freedom of speech stops when it is directed hate towards a person or a group of people. Online platforms do not have to tolerate hate speech on their platforms.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Just pay moderators
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3394231.3397902
__label__noRel	To understand how this can be managed in order that peoples opinionsare taken into account and not dismissed.	i do not agree with the method of doxxing people. hate speech has always existed, it is now on a more global scale because the world is more centralised as a result of social media. i believe the solution is censorship and moderation which sites like reddit and youtube already preactise.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	Yes there must be a a strong policy for reviewal before publishing.
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	due to the changing world and the improvement of technology,the internet is like a black canvas and anyone can put anything they want on it,but even though technology is improving most websites dont use basic protection,they could do things like add comment filters,then this ensures that hateful words or phrases cannot be used but positive and informative words and statements can be
__label__noRel	freedom of speech is important but not at the cost of other rights	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	having a team that moderates the comments beforehand is a good idea.do not post comments that have hate speech.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	Community moderation is used on many platforms to allow discussion whilst preventing hate speech from arising, however this is greatly dependent on human participation which can take a lot of work depending on the size of the community. Additionally, the removal of hateful comments can better a comment section, but will not change a commenters views- this has led to the development of more insular online communities fostering these more extreme or hateful views. People will create a space for their commentary if there isn't one provided (or if their comments are removed from somewhere). A lot of this comes down to what a given newspaper wants to be associated with (in the sense of their brand) as opposed to maintaining the sanctity of online discussion.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used...

That coupled with live moderation either by AI or human, and following rules that can quickly adapt to change should greatly rduce hate speech.

A report button is as useful which can allow for moderators to review comments and decide on the level of polarization.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	I think certain people should be not allowed to share their opinions publicly because their only intention is to create hate and to upset people. Separately, society need to be educated on how to communicate via Social Media.
__label__noRel	Newspapers have a duty of care to the reader so they should be vigilant	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.

__label__noRel	Although people might abuse the flagging, however, if there are reviewers to do their work on those flags, these comments that have been flagged intentionally would not be removed.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	Well then what is your proposition	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	This would be a lazy attempt to reduce hate speech as it doesn't allow for people to make genuine, thoughtful expressions of opinion that is useful for others to read.

__label__noRel	Requiring people to give a lot of information about themselves in order to give their opinion online is NOT a direction we should be going in. Moderators are fine; requiring people to dox themselves so they can be educated is not it.	Hate speech does more harm than good

__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.

I agree that free speech should be honoured and upheld. That being said, newspapers are their own entities that should have autonomy over their interactions and comments from readers.

__label__noRel	https://ifaamas.org/Proceedings/aamas2010/pdf/02%20Extended%20Abstracts/Blue/B-39.pdf	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	I don't think this is possible. We should go back to physical printed newspapers.
__label__noRel	moderators	I think removing the comment space is just avoiding the problem. There can be interesting and thoughtful comments and we would miss from them. Newspapers websites should instead try to regulate the comment space by introducing a bot or hiring appropriate moderators or there should be some punishment to discourage the use of hate speech.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	I think there should at least be a 'report' button and any hate speech reported should be removed.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	There should be some level of censoring to eliminate hate speech, but not to the extent where comments are totally disabled
__label__noRel	I think this is an invasion of privacy and the internet allows people to be the person they want to be and want to identify as - something they might not feel comfortable doing in real life.	Develop a software that will not allow posting of any hate speech
__label__noRel	While I agree that hate speech is such, I feel like getting rid of the comment section would really go backwards and do more harm than good.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	True, but not every criticism is valid	Hire moderators and similar positions, and also having filtering systems
__label__noRel	Removing them removes those concerns and creates a more positive website experience for the reader	we should keep comment sections on newspaper websites but we should have moderators to filter out any hate speech
__label__noRel	good point,i see this daily on my local paper,some people make it their hobby to just run down everything and everyone via the comments section.	The use of a system that detect hate speech before publishing
__label__noRel	I do agree that sometimes people can mistake different opinions as hate speech but I do think it is quite easy to understand that hate speech involves language that disrespect the person you are talking to	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	I overall agree. But, newspaper comment sections are very public and mainstream. Allowing hate speech on such places makes it seem less taboo, and more allowed. These aren't the kinds of ideas we want people to think are 'ok'.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	The comment section should not be taken out instead, they should use software that is able to detect hate speech and not allow it to be posted	I have read through some of the cooments and my stance is still the same. It is no doubt that hate speech is a problem, however, not allowing the public the opportunity to comment on issues may not only be a problem against freedom of speech, it may also cause the newspaper to lose some of its loyal readers if they're not able to engage with the content shared by the newspaper.
__label__noRel	Removing the option for opinion wouldn't stop the hate speech - this will just be featured somewhere else but being able to mark items as unkind would help identify things that may upset some people.	I think hate speech is always going to be a problem unfortunately, and although websites can monitor comments and remove any hate speech what ultimately is needed is teaching people there are better ways to get their opinions across and better use of freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Media isn't about sparking debate it's about catching our attention, profiting off our attention and sharing their biased view with us. Some countries have tighter regulations for media than others as well, plus they write salacious headlines for sale knowing people won't always read the full text of the article. They cause the polarization in conversation.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	I guess this works. However, people tend to find other ways to spread hate	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	A lot of the times I hear people railing against the censorship of hatespeech it is because they aren't aware of the damage they are causing or have been caught out saying something they didn't think was bad to begin with. I think that anything that is removed should be explained to the poster as well as the impact that t could have on other people
__label__noRel	Removing comment spaces completely reduces social participation which is super imporrant for educating others.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	I'd happily see all comments sections removed for the good of the public in general. Nobody needs to know that Tony from Bognor thinks All Them Lot Should Go Home, because Tony is a twat who shouldn't be given a platform.
__label__noRel	Stops people with genuine none discriminatory opinions to express themselves	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	This is not a realistic approach at this time. With the definition of "hate speech" becoming more and more loose and up for interpretation, this sets a dangerous precedent of government and law enforcement overreach. The only time where law enforcement may need to get involved is with blatant calls to violence - physical violence - or inciting hatred against a targeted individual or group. I agree somewhat with this point, but not in the direction things are starting to head in today's times.	More Admin and block buttons
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	State that the editor is free to print or not print any comments, and his/hers is the final decision.
__label__noRel	Removing all comments as a blanket measure is appropriate as it moves the conversations to other spaces. Newspapers should be for news, objective, they are no place for opinions	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	I think all the hate speech my be removed before it is published on public
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	Space on comments is a must have because many users get to participate into a good course that could help many others and therefore those spewing hate should be harshly dealt with. Blocked actively so
__label__noRel	As much as I would *like to* agree, I unfortunately cannot. Free speech still IS a part of free speech. I'm afraid you can't have one or the other - they are co-dependent as I believe, humans are inherently seeking conflict.	There needs to be a moderator who is reviewing the comments that are made, I see a lot of inappropriate comments posted to news stories on the comments section of the news articles on facebook that incite arguments and hate speech. This is not acceptable and should not be allowed to happen.
__label__noRel	free speech	i think minimum news coverage should be given to hate speech and it shouuld be very stictley monitered as well
__label__noRel	yes. good moderators are the key	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	I agree, this kind of moderation would be helpful	There could be a segment in the website that gives informed context to a subject to prevent uninformed comments and furthermore the newspaper should monitor the comments and censor any hate speech comments.
__label__noRel	that could also be helpful	they should monitor all comments and block people that post hate comments or censor certain hate words
__label__noRel	I feel this could lead to propagating false information through inclusion of poorly researched urls.	There should be no comment area in order to limit hate speech. Newspapers should be one-sided sources of information.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	I think there must be a system that will detect hateful comments and block them.

__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Where is the evidence for this? There is no guarantee that people will give correct credentials. Also, who defines 'hate speech'? This is not as simple as you may believe.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	According to newsy.com, between January and March 2022, Meta took action on more than 15 million pieces of hate speech content on Facebook. Roughly 95% of that was detected proactively by Facebook with the help of AI - https://www.newsy.com/stories/artificial-intelligence-is-used-to-track-down-hate-speech/#:~:text=Between%20January%20and%20March%202022,themes%20fall%20through%20the%20cracks.
__label__noRel	This could be considered less democratic and biased only showing positive comments. https://www.proquest.com/openview/87a0114d041605296b4dd4dd32634b4d/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750	There can be a filtering system that filters hate speech
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	I don't think removing the comment section reduces hate speech per se, it just pushes it elsewhere. I can't help feeling this sort of censorship is an infringement on free speech.
__label__noRel	Time	Computers should be able to detect hate speech if there is any and report and remove that comment whinin minutes of posting it
__label__noRel	Newspapers often weave opinion in to their presentation of the news, they don't always report just in a purely factual manner. No comment sections at all would stifle discussion.

The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	I think when there are professionals they can be balanced and have training alongside guidelines which can help guide what is and is not allowed	You can reduce hate speech by moderating the comments, banning repeating offenders and requiring a phone number to create a account.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	We need a more thick skin with some of our debate topics if we want to win arguements against "hate"
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I agree completely. People need to be educated	I have no real interest in reading readers comments sections in newspapers, but I don't agree that they should be eliminated. The content can be moderated to remove hate speech. This be done by a moderator, or these days, by AI.
__label__noRel	will not work at all the dynamics of the comments section are very polarised	Could ensure moderation of commonly used words for hate speech, and frequent moderation on these websites
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	by not allowing certain words to be used in the comments space
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Algorithms are a must to cut out hate speech. Allowing only paying subscribers is elitist but necessary as being traceable is important.
__label__noRel	Moderators if educated on what hate speech was would be a good idea	It seems like many users think that having your personally details posted along with your comment would be a deterrent for people to comment hate speech
__label__noRel	It is not possible for some people to ignore hate speech, and the effects can be extremely harmful - for example: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech	I enjoy reading through comments and I don't think that they should be removed, but there should be a lot more monitoring going on to remove any hateful ones as soon as they are posted.
__label__noRel	The comments section can not create fake news. It may attract people with extreme views but not people making up news themselves.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	As this topic is quite new there are some observations and guidelines from newspapers on what they do. I think there is some wisdom to be learnt from comparing the policies of diffierent companies to make a best practice. https://netino.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/WAN-IFRA_Online_Commenting.pdf\	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	This is not just a newspaper comment section problem... it's a social media problem as well, more like an internet problem. We need way to not push people away, but educate them. Because the truth is, nobody starts out as a hater but radicaliz ation can happen to anyone. check https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P55t6eryY3g
__label__noRel	It isn't perfect but it is a pretty decent %	Ask people to be respectful and back-up their opinions factually. The danger, of course, is attaching URLs or info that themselves propagate misinformation by presenting it as fact.
__label__noRel	https://www.salon.com/2018/11/17/why-comments-sections-must-die/ While this article seems to agree with this point of view, I still feel that taking away spaces for discussion isn't the way to control hate speech.	Having the option for complete anonimity and alter egos should be removed. I believe people will be much more careful with what they say if their name and face is attached to it.
__label__noRel	Newspapers ARE these platforms, or should be, in my opinion. Why not allow news to be challenged in the place where it is presented? Why risk leaving it unchallenged?	Allow users to report comments.
__label__noRel	Because some peoples opinions can be hurtful to others	The problem with moderating means that people may have a stance on what counts as a hate comment and may cause differing opinions and deletions of stuff that may just be outside someone's comfort zone https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry.

It encourages people to read about the topic before making comments and peopel can easily reference reference the article in their comments. I think this allows for a more fruitful and productive discussion that on other platforms e.g. social media. However, hate speech is certainly an issue and easily derails conversations. While moderation of hate speech would be ideal, the burden on the newspaper is likely too great to do this manually. Perhaps a mixture of auto-moderation (flagging/removing key words), manual review by the newspaper and some form of community moderation may work well together.

Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	I think that only people who provided identifying information can post their opinions. Also I agree that there should be AL tools to prevent hate speech. Eliminating hate speech from newspaper websites has nothing to do with the infringement of the free speech right.
__label__noRel	The media is based on the idea that they have the freedom to write or speak about any topic they wish. To take that same idea away from other people to respond and contribute freely to what is being said would be the end of a diverse and opinionated society. I don't think that silencing the reader would stop them in engaging and maybe even caring.	freedom of speech is essential but hate speech is not. comments should be left on but perhaps there could be a programme which finds key words and eliminates the comment if it seems to be hateful
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	More emphasis on moderation of specific language would reduce the risk of hate speech. Also, moderators approving comments before they appear on the website would help.
__label__noRel	Taking us to a reputable source.	Is it actually their responsibilty?
__label__noRel	I really think this could work as technology has come so far and it's out there and available to be used.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	If newspapers did not allow interaction and went back to old school 1 way news, they would die out, nobody uses that anynore	By monitoring individual responses and removing those not deemed suitable for publication

__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	The question is? Is hate speech not part of free speech? I think people should be left to express themselves however they feel is appropriate as long as they are not breaking an laws
__label__noRel	Helps prevent mental illnesses via online platforms.	I believe comment sections should be moderated more to prevent the obvious hate speech and statements that do not add anything useful to the discussion
__label__noRel	Yes people are very technological savvy and capable of using fake accounts to continue spreading whatever comments without consideration and that makes it hard to trace them.	I think newspapers websites should have an online system that can detect hate speech and block users that use this kind of language but keeping it open for negative or positive feedback would be fair but not giving readers the freedom to use hate speech.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	Newspaper should avoid subscription from people who use hate speech
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	I think through fair moderation, then the amount of hate speech will be reduced.
__label__noRel	Much as I agree that's probably ideal as far as not requiring constant monitoring of the sort that's only really feasible for a relatively small amount of newer articles, the kind of technology for properly filtering such things isn't quite there yet, beyond simply checking for specific language. ...and it's worth noting, even if it was, whoever writes the algorithm also decides what is worthy of being removed. Being able to cull commentary automatically this way is potentially even more damaging if your concern is freedom of speech.	Algorithms are a must to cut out hate speech. Allowing only paying subscribers is elitist but necessary as being traceable is important.

__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	Hate speech is a form of self publicity. If the community isolates the perpetrators by flagging negative content that would be helpful. Flagged content would then need to be followed by banning perpetrators
__label__noRel	In a fast moving comments section with lots of commentators it would be impossible to moderate in real time.	There should be automatic filters but they are not 100, so there should also be a team of people constanly monitoring and reviewing complaints and reports. I feel like it is the only way to keep the freedom of speech but also protect people who might be victims of it.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Provide a clear definition on what is considered hate speech and eliminate those comments that fit in that definition

__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words.

Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	Newspapers and the media have a big role to play, but so do others	That would take away free speech, however I think they need to add some sort of AI that can immediately pick up any forms of hate speech and immediately delete or even block it
__label__noRel	I agree, this sounds like a sensible solution.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Makes sense	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	this could be done by filtering terms	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__noRel	I agree	This project takes the approach of counterspeech, whereby hateful comments are not removed, but instead responded to with alternative, police and non-aggressive comments. https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/counterspeech-better-way-tackling-online-hate
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	Free speech is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it is necessary for an effective democratic society and on the other hand, people tend to abuse the right. Newspapers and publishing companies are major symbols of free speech, however, and there will always be disadvantages to be endured, hate speech inclusive. The solution is not to disable comment spaces but to continually implore and push for cooperation amongst readers.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	the comment section should not be disabled as is it there for the readers to engage with the content uploaded so it makes no sense to close it, however there should be restrictions.
__label__noRel	Agreed	Could ensure moderation of commonly used words for hate speech, and frequent moderation on these websites

__label__noRel	Absolutely correct. The important thing is to identify what hate speech actually means, because what is offensive to one individual might not be to another.	Commenters should agree to abide by all rules when signing up to the website and he banned for breaking the rules. Also all submitted comments must be thoroughly checked for negative for flagged words or topics. Also I think it would reduce the chances of this happening if users could not reply to each other or comment on others opinions.

__label__noRel	Unmoderated online comment forums are magnets for noxious speech. For years they have carried people’s discontent out into the world, while the writers sit safely behind screens. It’s almost bittersweet to think back on the time we once blamed internet flaming on the online disinhibition of middle school pranksters. It is the many unhappy adults in the electorate who are posting the things they are really thinking in comment boxes. Nearly three-quarters of internet users – 73 percent – have witnessed online harassment. News website comment sections host antagonistic conversations between contributors. Nine out of 10 respondents of a Pew Research study said the online environment was more enabling of criticism. The squabbling can be overwhelming: As many as 34 percent of news commenters and 41 percent of news comment readers identified argumentative comments as the reason they avoid reading or joining the discourse. Multiple studies show online communities develop sophisticated norms that guide participants. Anger begets more anger. Unshackled digital vitriol is now volleyed back and forth online from all sides. Some commenters don’t even care if they are anonymous anymore. Researchers have found real-name comments on social media are actually nastier than unsigned commentary. Historically, American democracy always had some rudeness baked into it. For example, during the presidential election of 1800, incumbent President John Adams’ campaign proclaimed “murder, robbery, rape, adultery and incest will all be openly taught and practiced” if his opponent, Thomas Jefferson, won the presidency. Jefferson, meanwhile, described Adams as “a hideous hermaphroditical character,” with “neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman.” Civility in public discourse is often what people in power expect of their citizens. Demands for civility can be used by those with authority to deny power to those with none. People who feel marginalized or alienated use incivility and civil disobedience to fight the power. By causing offense and indignation, as we saw during Campaign 2016, outsiders gained massive attention for their cause. Yet “democracy only functions when its participants abide by certain conventions, certain codes of conduct and a respect for the process,” wrote cultural journalist Neal Gabler in an eloquent essay about how a hateful electorate threatens democracy. Gabler noted that the 2016 presidential campaign was referred to as the “hate election” because everyone professed to hate both candidates. It turned out to be the hate election, Gabler mused, “because of the hatefulness of the electorate.” He went on:https://theconversation.com/how-news-sites-online-comments-helped-build-our-hateful-electorate-70170	It is true that it would be difficult to remove and control all of the comments however i think it would be a lot more damaging to remove the right to freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Removing the comment section will not solve the problem. It will just create a filling of censorship and will make debate and dialogue vanish. It is important that people discuss news topics and also give feedback on those news to the newspaper. It is important to moderate this comments in a strict no hate speech way and bring accountability in. Eliminating comments will just hide a problem that needs to be fixed by moderating and educating people.
__label__noRel	I think people are so wary of giving personal information out online that this would put people off commenting and while this might deter 'keyboard warriors' who are happy to hide behind a screen I dont think it would be helpful to have the threat of being tracked down.

__label__noRel	This is true, moreover as it is said in this article https://medium.com/@flytedesk/the-pros-and-cons-of-removing-a-website-comment-section-9bea62f8e42b, removing a comment section might be thought by some users as a going against free speech and they will also spend less time on the website, leading to worse performances of the brand/website.

__label__noRel	Yes, it is a very difficult balance and trying to find mechanisms that are fair and balanced to control these are basically impossible to find.	The use of a system that detect hate speech before publishing
__label__noRel	Legisation should be applied based on same principles thoughout countries to preserve freedom of speech and also ensure hate speech and arising violence is eliminated	The power of newspapers is too strong and needs to be restricted , moderation of the comments section is needed linked with non anonymous posting of mcomments
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	freedom speech is good but it assumes that common sense prevails too
__label__noRel	As technology becomes more advanced, there are algorithms that detect hate speech, for example on Twitter. People can also report hateful comments so that only appropiate comments are left.	i agree that removing comments about hate speech is not the way to go
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	Moderating comments is a far better method than eliminating comments entirely. I feel a method for reporting comments, though not perfect, is better, and then reported comments can be examined and removed if necessary.
__label__noRel	removing the comment section will drive traffic away and decrease the amount of time readers engage with the newspaper.	people must change, not internet/website
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	Allow for a voting system on the comments, so as the cream rises to the top and the dredges sink away.

The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	freedom of speech	I think that the introduction of moderators to remove any hate speech would be beneficial. Perhaps the introduction of guidelines as to what constitutes permitted negative comments.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	The words chosen to be used are very essential when in comes to the reader and a writer. The content that is viewed as a hate speech should not be shown to the other readers. It should automatically give a warning to the writer and after 3 warnings they should be blocked as they do not comply with the terms and conditions.
__label__noRel	This is a good argument, instead of trying to stop free speech altogether rather look to filter out specifically hate speech.	I think I would prefer to see that comments sections are removed rather than untruths being pushed at people.
__label__noRel	good point,i see this daily on my local paper,some people make it their hobby to just run down everything and everyone via the comments section.	Just don't write about it
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	True and in my opinion the right to freedom of speech should trump any counter argument.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	I agree	I think certain people should be not allowed to share their opinions publicly because their only intention is to create hate and to upset people. Separately, society need to be educated on how to communicate via Social Media.
__label__noRel	But allowing hate speech to flourish would mean that comment space would be filled with spammers and hate speech and it would become useless.	By having an algorithm that detects and deletes any hate speech comment.
__label__noRel	That's not true, there are millions of platforms to hold conversation about news articles without talking directly under them. Everything they right is open to public scrutiny.	There absolutely are ways to facilitate healthy conversation and debates without allowing hate speech. Both algorithms and human moderation are ways to ensure debate can continue without resorting to abuse.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	By having stricter controls over who can sign up to the comments and blocking them from the sites when they use hate speech. It's unfortunate that it happens, but sometimes they are loud just to get attention. Starve them of it.
__label__noRel	I agree with the sentiment but the use of the word "should" emphasises that some people are not able to practice respect and tolerance as a pre-requisite	By using a tool to search for hate speech
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	I am proposing the use of AI to manage this space
__label__noRel	I agree that we have to be very careful around censorship. Shutting commentary down because it doesn't fit your agenda or internal narrative can be very dangerous as it is a tool used by dictators.	This should be a priority, some hate speech is not necessary
__label__noRel	Training AI to do that would be a great way to prevent this phenomen	I totally agree that hate speech should be limited as some readers do not take it lightly and may harm themselves after reading. I have heard stories about people ending their lives after their stories which often are embarassing are published, and the situation made worse by the comment section.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	We can reduce hate speech by holding the owner of the platform accountable for hate speech being on their platform, this will force the platform owners to put strict systems in place to ensure this does not occur.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	I would not eliminate the hate speech right away but rather alarm the user and ask them to refrain from that kind of speech or ask them to elaborate or explain the reasons for the anger. Maybe as a moderator I would try to understand their viewpoint because by removing the speech there will be just more anger and hatred.
__label__noRel	That will take too long time to do manually, so it's best to ban some words in the start. If the user is using to many of the banned words, then ban the user automatically.	By having stricter controls over who can sign up to the comments and blocking them from the sites when they use hate speech. It's unfortunate that it happens, but sometimes they are loud just to get attention. Starve them of it.
__label__noRel	I do agree that comments shouldn't be closed.	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	Allows less bias when reading or consuming news content	I think removing space for comments is not the solution because how else will people discuss the matter at hand or share their opinion. I think hate speech should be set to be hidden from being viewed instread.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	people feel powerful behind an anonymous account, its easier to say things you would never normally say under the guise of anonymity, if it was easier to link a comment to who it came from and if people actually faced consequences from posting hate then this could help stop it.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__noRel	This article shows the benefits that controlling hate speech has, especially on diverse groups. It would be wrong to not attempt to control this situation.	I disagree. Comments might be useful for users and also the owners of the newspapers. Though, asking people to identify themselves when registering could help reduce hate speech, as people would not be able to do whatever they want anonymously.
__label__noRel	You didn't discuss why they should not include a comments section. A comment sections allows the public to share their opinions on the subject matter and engage with one another pros and cons of the issue and see other points of view.	Agreeing with others here: a standard of moderation would have to be communicated to the user, with straightforward policies of flagging or reporting potentially hateful comments. A synthesis of live and algorithmic moderators might be best, as certain words can be auto-flagged for review, whereas other things might involve a more delicate touch.
__label__noRel	Agree	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted.

__label__noRel	Agreed, this article shares the same views. Its should not be the Newspaper taking accountability	Filter words so if a comment contains this word it will be reviewed as to if it is appropriate or automatically deleted
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	Allowing people who have profiles with the website to comment. Anonymity should not be allowed. Information that is traceable to an individual could be implemented(even though may be intrusive) could be requested when creating a profile.

__label__noRel	Hate speech is not acceptable and this would help to prevent the possibly of appearing online.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	I agree	I believe comment sections should be moderated more to prevent the obvious hate speech and statements that do not add anything useful to the discussion
__label__noRel	Moderators could be biased on subjective in their opinions.	They could force users to login and even if they chose to post annonymously, it can be flagged for hate speech and they can be banned from using the platform again.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	Agreed
__label__noRel	I support the filtering of comments instead of removing the comment section. A filtering systems should be put in place	comment sections should not be removed as that will prevent those with positive comments form sharing their thoughts, they should instead be reviewed regulary so that hate speech is flagged and removed another solution is for comments to be approved by moderators before they go public
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	yes it's true several articles show the effects that harassment on social networks can have on mental health	People will always spew hate speech and regulating it may be difficult to do. Freedom of speech should prevail therefore eliminating the comments section would be wrong. The newspaper site may have an automation that identifies hate words and whenever these appear the comment should be hidden from the comments section.
__label__noRel	AI would be a great tool in conjunction with other moderation measures but is not reliable enough to be used on its own.	I believe that with real time moderation , if the comments can be removed before causing any distress to people then this is a better option than removing the ability to make comments.
__label__noRel	On the other hand if platforms are held accountable, they may prefer to remove all comments sections, so as not to be punished themselves.	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	We could introduce a system online where it automatically filters out bad language or hate speech by using key words.
__label__noRel	Its ok to have some negative comments as long as they are balanced and not offensive or personal	Is it necessary to have readers comments? What do they add to the article?
__label__noRel	freedom of speech	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	I feel that in this case, by getting rid of hate speech, I feel that it is worth sacrificing a part of free speech in order to make everyone feel comfortable.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Comments could be checked for hate speech before going live.
__label__noRel	Agreed, more understanding and education are always good for society. Moderation functions as a good intermediary for discussion.	Like I mentioned previously,the need for artificial intelligence is vital and like what AliceW mentioned in hjer post that people needs to be educated about hate speech which I strongly support.I also think it is everyone's responsibility to educate each other the damage hate speech has to individuals and the society at large
__label__noRel	I totally disagree with this because this sounds like a violation of of the human right to freedom of speech. Also, this means that newspapers will be able to get away with publishing articles that the general public does not agree with without any repercussions.	It's a balance. There should be the ability to pre- and post-moderate comments. Pre- using technology to recognise potentially offensive words as well as closer moderation of articles on potentially controversial topics. Post-moderation to allow readers to report offensive topics which will be hidden from view until moderated.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	It seems this remains a diffcult question, with varying responses on the subject
__label__noRel	people need to be nicer online	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	Good for open mindedness.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	Yes there should be	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	you ca reduce hate speech by adding an ai bot that can distinguishly remove between violent words from a comment. A report button is as useful which can allow for moderators to review comments and decide on the level of polarization.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	Could ensure moderation of commonly used words for hate speech, and frequent moderation on these websites
__label__noRel	anyone writing things against the prevailing narrative will be shut down. George Orwell wrote this would happen and women would be the ones easily taken in and become enforcers.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	Hate speech can be controlled by blacklisting keywords on the search engine of a particular blog post/newspapers which will delete any comments that may contain any of the blacklisted keywords.
__label__noRel	online verification can create a more personal and tangible online persona in whch people feel accounatable and scrutinised	we need to stop coment section
__label__noRel	Someone needs to be employed to regulate the chat	Moderation is key. Plenty of newspapers and online media are able to keep comments open with a bit of moderation.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	the best way is for companies to filter hate speech and remove it as long as the criteria for hate speech comes from an independent organisation. If companies themselves govern what is hate speech then we would become subject to there rules which you would lose the point of freedom of speech. Also there should be more support in the community for people who are being targeted in hate speech attacks.
__label__noRel	It's important not to confuse freedom of speech and hate speech: "freedom" can be a dangerous weapon when you use it to attack others for their identity.	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	But have you considered which one has more serious effects and consequences? I think that should be guiding in the main argument on whether to allow commenting or allow hate speech	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Newspaper websites can eliminate space for readers comments for articles that they think are more likely to receive more hate speech
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	State that the editor is free to print or not print any comments, and his/hers is the final decision.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	I think that the warning system is a good route, as the AI might eliminate valid arguments and miss hate speech accidentally. A warning system would still need an AI, but it warns users that their comment may be hate speech and if it is, the user can rethink their wording or risk posting it. If they post it, maybe a manual review can happen to determine if it was hate speech or not.
__label__noRel	This leaves space for people to bully and be toxic without any consequences	There could be a segment in the website that gives informed context to a subject to prevent uninformed comments and furthermore the newspaper should monitor the comments and censor any hate speech comments.
__label__noRel	Definitely, it can be very polarising in itself with a definition and cause more issue if the wrong thing is removed	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	Much as I agree that's probably ideal as far as not requiring constant monitoring of the sort that's only really feasible for a relatively small amount of newer articles, the kind of technology for properly filtering such things isn't quite there yet, beyond simply checking for specific language. ...and it's worth noting, even if it was, whoever writes the algorithm also decides what is worthy of being removed. Being able to cull commentary automatically this way is potentially even more damaging if your concern is freedom of speech.	Make readers agree to not sharing hate speech and let them know that if they do, they will be blocked from commenting.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	Removing comment sections on newspapers, enables limited misinformation and discrimination to reproduce.	But education and training and awareness are also needed, so people don't repeat what mistakes they have done in the past.
__label__noRel	I think this is true and there is no need for spiteful comments to be made and ruin someone's day.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	banning certain words would absolutely work.	Could ensure moderation of commonly used words for hate speech, and frequent moderation on these websites
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.

__label__noRel	I agree.

__label__noRel	agree with this! Lack of education is often the biggest culprits when it comes to hate speech - many people are scared of things they don't know about.	I think people should be encouraged to give personal comments however they need to be monitored to ensure hate speech cannot be seen which might negatively impact others
__label__noRel	people can no longer criticise	Use a BOT to regulate hateful comments
__label__noRel	There would potentially be reduction of hate speeches, but similarly there would be removal of positive speeches/opinions.	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	we need to understand that freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom of hatred	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	I absolutely agree that people need to have an outlet to share their opinion, whatever that is. And the only reason to really turn comments off is where someone is seeking information, and have their answer/are satisfied with the response; but on a news site, I feel like blocking comments is a cop out for a controversial story, or to protect the sources feelings rather than giving the public a right to have a say.	ADD A HATE SPEECH DETECTOR
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	We need to create a society where we can debate with each other respectfully, we can know which platforms to use and not rile each other up without offending. It is widely suggested that education can address the extent of hate speech: https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/addressing-hate-speech-through-education-global-education-ministers-conference. However, this needs to go hand in hand with moderation of sites to ensure people are kept within reason. It is not a case of any one single solution.

__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	The words chosen to be used are very essential when in comes to the reader and a writer. The content that is viewed as a hate speech should not be shown to the other readers. It should automatically give a warning to the writer and after 3 warnings they should be blocked as they do not comply with the terms and conditions.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	Have moderators who constantly monitor and remove hateful posts or ones that are inciting others/goading others.
__label__noRel	I agree, public debate is good.	The only way to combat hate speech is through open debate. Restricting any form of speech (even hate speech) could lead to hateful views becoming unchallenged and potentially result in violence. There is also the issue that newspapers could define hate speech as certain comments they don't like destroying any potential for open debate. By maintaining open debate hate speech can be called out and as a result, become less frequent.
__label__noRel	that's right, comments actually can give a lot useful information but also give all the wrong idea about particular article.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	How much hate speech is there really on newspaper comments sections? Usually a difference of opinion is enough for some people to lurch for the "hate speech" card in order to get a comment removed because they don't like a different viewpoint.

__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	I think that only people who provided identifying information can post their opinions. Also I agree that there should be AL tools to prevent hate speech. Eliminating hate speech from newspaper websites has nothing to do with the infringement of the free speech right.
__label__noRel	no engage from the readers	I feel that people should be allowed to have freedom of expression online but should be held accountable for vitriolic and unbased hate speech, this could be achieved by proving identity and by using citations and references when posting online
__label__noRel	I agree	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	I agree with this comment	Before an opinion is published it must be moderated and if it contains hate speech then the writer will not be able to post it.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	A possible way to address hate speech on newspaper sites would be to incorporate both human moderators and some sort of AI that monitors for hateful words and comments. The requirement to submit personally identifying information before commenting might also help because without this then anyone can create a fake name that hides the person's true identity so therefore more likely to engage in hate speech. If personal information is required, then hate speech would be less likely.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	Just don't write about it
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry.

__label__noRel	I disagree and believe that other views should be respected and be allowed to be aired. If we only read one particular newspaper then our view will become one sided, with a comments section arguing different points, then it opens us up to many other arguments.	Even though I am generally curious to read other people's comments, I think the best would actually be to eliminate comments altogether, or restrict to the way paper news work, i.e. you can write a letter and they might publish it next time.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	You should be allowed to give your opinion to express your view about a news article. To moderate this or to filter what you can and cannot say would it stop it from being free speech. What really needs to be looked at is to see how you can stop online trolling which I think is the root cause of some of these comment sections become so toxic. But for the media who is so depended on free speech themselves so that they can report on news in an unbiased way to eliminate the comment space is almost hypocritical. Just a weird idea here but perhaps you should do a quick test or verification before you can comment. A lot of people would not go through the effort of completing this if they just want to spread hate.
__label__noRel	I like the idea of auto-moderation to automatically screen out comments with certain words that are considered hate speech	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	not fair on those who don't mean hate	Hate speech is a problem but we do need to have debate. We need to respect different views and allow people to voice their opinion where necessary to further a debate on a news topic. Having the comments vetted before they appear does allow for some censorship but that must not be at the cost of open discussion.
__label__noRel	There should be a right to free speech and peoples views	you cannot eliminate it. dont try. freedom of speech is importante and we must appreciae others have different view
__label__noRel	The newspapers will not get to know how people realy feel about the issue at hand if the comment space is closed.

__label__noRel	Newspapers do not want to face critism by removing comments column, unfair society	I totally agree that hate speech should be limited as some readers do not take it lightly and may harm themselves after reading.

__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way.

Other people can disagree - they should not allow themselves to be angered by opinions with which they disagree.
__label__noRel	Punishments would be good but also a mixture of education and this could help. Hate speech is a very person-by-person thing, what some may think isn't, some may think is.

In a survey of news sites it was found that on average 11% of comments are removed...some of these are because they are spam and some because they are offensive. I think that the fact that it's more than one in two really shows how necessary moderation is, these issues are so common. Source: https://netino.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/WAN-IFRA_Online_Commenting.pdf (pg 7)
__label__noRel	Free speech should only be allowed if it doesn't infringe someone else's right, like hate speech does.	We can remove it fairly by making rules and monitoring the comment section.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	I think that people should sign up and verify their identity before they are able to leave a comment on a news platform so they are not anonymous and anything that is written can be tracked to the individual and they can be held accountable.

__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way.

__label__noRel	Doing nothing because of a fear that doing something will be ineffective, means simply that nothing will definitely be achieved. Freedom of speech is definitely curtailed if people who are likely to be attacked are themselves, afraid to speak. The experience of CreepyPMs in keeping their site open, friendly and inclusive, using 30 moderators for a relatively small site and a tough policy where in essence that comments must be conductive to a supportive environment and if not, can be removed, even if they have not violated a specific rule, seems to potentially curtail freedom of speech and could silence valid criticism but can also "allow marginalised and targeted individuals who are not likely to share their stories or opinions when the door is left open to the rest of the world" to speak. https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation	i agree that moderators have their uses but then unless they are trained properly their biases may creep in

__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it.

__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	Hate speech should not be allowed to dominate the narrative as it defeats the process and hinders effective communication. As a result, flagging and blocking of problematic accounts can prove to be effective in combating the spread of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	I'm finding replying to comments here really awkward. As soon as I start typing the page moves, grrrr! However, I don't agree with vetting comments. I do agree with free speech, but not hate speech. People are entitled to an opinion without having to be nasty or a keyboard warrior. Moderating could be used to take out hateful comments, without taking away a well rounded debate, but where those lines are drawn is anyones guess!

__label__noRel	Robots cannot feel empathy or anything to distinguish between a regular comment and a comment containing hate speech.	This article made me reflect on the definition of hate speech and I aggree with blocking comments that go against a persons protected characteristics - if a comment like that is made, it should instantly be banned from the platform / comment section. https://about.fb.com/news/2017/06/hard-questions-hate-speech/
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way.

While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	Perhaps but a well defined policy by the newspaper should be able to indicate what is and is not allowed	This should be done with a mix of moderation, community flagging and reporting before moving to disabling comments, based ona mix of moderative judgement and amount of flagging
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	I disagree, comment sections allow the public to engage with the news and find people similar to them	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.

__label__noRel	https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/05/reader-comments-on-news-sites-we-want-to-hear-what-your-publication-does/ This article highlights what effect hate speech has on readers in the comments sections	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	i agree with this. although i believe that freedom of speech and hate speech do not have a visible line. thus someone may be hiding behind the guise of freedom of speech but spewing hate rhetoric.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	I agree with you, online privacy is already a massive issue, I don't want to have to submit even more personal data (that could end up sold to advertisers) just to comment on an article. I also don't think 'tracking down' people who post hate speech online is practical or achievable.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	Arguably it could be in the newspaper's self-interest to police hate speech even if we say that it's not necessarily their responsibility, as moderation of comment sections has been shown to reduce perceptions of bias of the article itse lf (see e.g. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369118X.2017.1356861)	i believe commenting should have it's policy, where users have to read the policy before commenting. So if a user uses language that promotes hate speech, the comment should be removed.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	have an admin or moderator remove inappropriate comments.
__label__noRel	Hate speech is some fairly clear definitions, particularly around race and gender [https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech], so it really shouldn't be hard to identify clearly offensive comments directed at a person or group of persons, over valid criticism. The only danger is if the moderator is also biased and does not like an opinion, but in these cases, an independent review will clearly show an abuse of moderator power.	Take a few minutes to breathe, meditate, and physically calm your body down before you start typing your response.
__label__noRel	I agree completely. People need to be educated	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	History and recent events have shown that there should be limits to free speech	i believe commenting should have it's policy, where users have to read the policy before commenting. So if a user uses language that promotes hate speech, the comment should be removed.
__label__noRel	They can be made visible	Removing the comment section all together is a fair point as news is meant to be fair and impartial. People share their opinions based on their biases and that's not what the news is for - that's what social media is for. But in this case allowing the comment section to remain would be great if people would not abuse the power to share freely by sharing hate speech and slander. us as humans need to be regulated by a set of rules in order to keep a functioning society and i think a filtered comment section is the solution.
__label__noRel	I think the fact that Facebook, one of the richest companies in the world, struggle with moderation points to the fact that small local newspapers would struggle. Especially if one of their stores goes viral or something.	I think there should be red flagged or blacklisted words that shouldn't be allowed to be used in reader's comments. If a certain post contain such words, it should not be automatically exposed to other readers but should be reviewed first by the admin to check if it meets the standard before being exposed to everyone.
__label__noRel	accountability by inputting details is a good solution	I believe that with real time moderation , if the comments can be removed before causing any distress to people then this is a better option than removing the ability to make comments.
__label__noRel	This may cost a company, but will also create jobs in our current stressful climate.	I think it'll be hard to do so, because everyone has the right to freedom of speech, but unless the comments brings acts of violence on people then it must be deleted
__label__noRel	I disagree, I think there is no difference on both platforms.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.

__label__noRel	News papers might get very restrictive	Hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by educating people about the consequences of hate speech and what they can do to someone else.
__label__noRel	True. I agree	i agree that moderators have their uses but then unless they are trained properly their biases may creep in
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed.

__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	some people "troll" by writing inflammatory remarks, but it is fundamental to a free society to have free discussion. Any attempts at calling something "hate speech" will be only about stopping anything that goes against the narratives of the rich establishment.

__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	"Freedom of Speech'...that's a popular consensus among the masses, regardless of the "casualities" that are left on the wayside. Having reread a lot of the comments posted here, I do consider the possibility of having people comment as they wish, politically correct or not. HOWEVER, let there be consequences involved, such as naming and shaming, and acquring user details if need be, after all, things such as cyber crime, online harrassment, etc do exist, am I right? And so, if such a comment borders on this, let it become a criminal matter and have law enforcement dealing specifically in cyber-related crimes become involved. Problem solved.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	I think if all comments go under review for hate speech, that should still allow a chance for hate speech comments to be retracted
__label__noRel	I believe you are referencing an AI, but that would require certain technology and datasets for it to understand what to look for. You can also argue that hateful words can be used in a certain context to argue a point, rather than as a directly hateful comment.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	I agree with this comment there is no way to stop hate speaking but it can be done to draw a line and set up some limitations	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	We can reduce hate speech by having it moderated
__label__noRel	Newspapers role is already to sell information, censorship can be done without doing comments with hate speech.	people should have values and respect for others.Just like facebook written words are monitored and people already know these rules.A set of rules should be set
__label__noRel	yes, in this way since it will be able to detect hate speech, and readers will still have a chance to news others options, nor to add their thoughts into the account.	While censoring certain words in the context of a comment would help reduce hate speech, an issue that would need to be considered is the use of images used as hate speech. Some "memes" can contain hate speech to the AI may misinterpret this as a regular image while the image could be posted as hate speech. An example of this is when people on Reddit use images as "memes" containing racism and sometimes the bot does not flag it as racism. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230
__label__noRel	I agree, but trolls want to be trolls if they wanted to be trolls. People should be held accountable as well.	Comments should be regulated, but comment space should not be removed.

__label__noRel	Some comments can be seen as hate speech but they are not hate speech. They will be taken down and that will prevent freedom of speech	Recent political positions in the UK have lead to more fighting for 'free speech' and saying that it is ok to be offended - this is shown in a police news release (https://www.college.police.uk/article/protecting-freedom-expression-updated-guidance). I would disagree - offending people is unacceptable.

__label__noRel	I feel they do have a responsibility to monitor trolling and abusive behaviour as this can be harmful to others. A modern legal test of the legitimacy of proposed restrictions on freedom of speech was stated in the opinion by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. in Schenk v. U.S. (1919): a restriction is legitimate only if the speech in question poses a “clear and present danger”—i.e., a risk or threat to safety or to other public interests that is serious and imminent.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	The problem is some form of censorship would be required for writers if the definition of "hate speech" isn't universally agreed. Perhaps a trigger warning for readers of a sensitive disposition could be given at the start of an article. Different countries have different laws or understandings of hate speech. Will comments from different countries have to be blocked?	According to newsy.com, between January and March 2022, Meta took action on more than 15 million pieces of hate speech content on Facebook. Roughly 95% of that was detected proactively by Facebook with the help of AI - https://www.newsy.com/stories/artificial-intelligence-is-used-to-track-down-hate-speech/#:~:text=Between%20January%20and%20March%202022,themes%20fall%20through%20the%20cracks.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	I think newspapers should not take away the comment section. Firstly this is unfair to all the people who want to have their say and should be able to do so Dominicis wrong
__label__noRel	I believe it is fair for hate speech comments to be censored, because it could lead to violent public behavior. (read this: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech)	freedom speech is good but it assumes that common sense prevails too
__label__noRel	Th Un have argued that we need to address hate crime https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.

__label__noRel	I agree while hate speech can be and should be monitored and removed immediately in order to reduce trauma on affected group and not to embolden other bigots. Platforms should still allow users to express opinions contrary to the creators. Peer review of reporting works well in these instances when someone goes too far - but this is also abused by with review bombing	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	Through active moderation.
__label__noRel	This is like saying if there are less weeds in the garden there is less work. The weeds grow. We have to address the weeds.	there needs to be some form of ceneorship of what newspaper can post i dont mean full censorship i just mean around things realating to hate of certain group
__label__noRel	this article : https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/830/3/032006 indicates that the algorithm that is considered to be the best for removing hate speech is still only just over 71% effective.

The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	As much as I agree with you that everyone should be able to express their own ideas. The internet is full of trolls who are constantly usung hate speech and without any guidelines or moderation. It's quite impossible for there not to be any "aggressiveness."	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	by having it monitored and removing hate speech at source
__label__noRel	This is a great solution	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	yes. good moderators are the key	freedom of speech is essential but hate speech is not. comments should be left on but perhaps there could be a programme which finds key words and eliminates the comment if it seems to be hateful
__label__noRel	Algorithms dont always get it right	Monitoring of comment areas is not realistic
__label__noRel	Everyone is entitled to their opinions	Hate speech must be banned totally from the online publications.
__label__noRel	Privacy issues. I know that my information are already somehow online but no one would be willing to give them freely, with the risk of being persecuted.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	There is a careful balance to be made between protecting others from the effects of hate speech and protecting free speech. Online hate speech unfortunately can have the effect of increasing violence against minorities (https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons) but blocking all free speech because of the actions of a few seems like a poor decision. More must be done to remove hate speech online quickly and this means spending more money tackling it.
__label__noRel	By 'standards', maybe certain words should be blocked? Users who continue to post blocked words eventually being banned.	By using a tool to search for hate speech
__label__noRel	I believe if almost everyone who knows about hate speech will know what to say and what not to say.	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	One user by the name of AndreaP said in order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section Newspapers should be one sided providers. I strongly disagree with this argument. It is very autocratic and happens a lot in countries where media and citizens does not have freedom and oppressed by harsh leadership. Comments in newspapers help many to get raw information from the ground and open minds of many to see issues differently from differing opinions. Indeed comments section are necessary
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	By using a tool that searches for likely words: hate, etc.
__label__noRel	Freedom of speech does exist, and every user has the right to say what they wish. Where is the line drawn in regard to this discriminatory content?	Develop a software that will not allow posting of any hate speech
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	However there is the potential to much greater exposure to it on online than in past times. Therefore I continue to believe that greater controls on those posting comments will decrease mindless hate speech and promote constructive debate.
__label__noRel	Stop unnessacary hate towards people	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	Not allowing hateful comment does not mean we limit people freedom of speech but promote kindness.	I think newspapers should not take away the comment section. Firstly this is unfair to all the people who want to have their say and should be able to do so Dominicis wrong
__label__noRel	However a view point can be expressed appropriately as a constructive criticism by the target audience. Therefore you could argue that anyone who engages in hate speech is the wrong audience.	State that the editor is free to print or not print any comments, and his/hers is the final decision.
__label__noRel	No comments means less moderator headaches and potential to offend	There need to be some kind of moderation, either before or after comments are published
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	I agree that free speech should be honoured and upheld. That being said, newspapers are their own entities that should have autonomy over their interactions and comments from readers. Therefore, I think the use of moderators, filtering out certain offensive language, and strict and visible posting guidelines are good ways to reduce hate speech on these websites.
__label__noRel	I agree	Strict moderation of comments prior to them being published may be the only way to limit hate speech on comments sections.
__label__noRel	Not necessarily. I think opinions are okay but not when it is hate and discrimination. Thinking morally that is wrong and shouldn't be allowed on any type of platform.	have an active moderator to remove any hate speech

If someone wants to just use a racist term or promote their website, then these people's comment should be removed and they should be banned from commenting for a period of time. The idea to remove comments entirely is absurd as the news is not trustworthy enough to be the sole voice people hear. We need to hear other voices.

__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender.

I don't think algorithms are the answer. They need to be very, very sophisticated otherwise they require a human mediator.
__label__noRel	I agree, if we were to allow the public to have 'freedom of speech' We need to ensure someone who is unbiased can remove the comments that will only fuel hatred and not give a well structured opinion a chance.	The difficulty with moderation is that it is subjective - if done so via human moderation if there is no existing framework to follow particular viewpoints or comments may not be seen to be worthy of removing though for others this may not be the case. If moderating is done so by filtering words or with no human intervention, over-moderation is a risk. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2056305119832588
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	As much as it might seem an attempt to constrict expression of thought, I agree comments should no longer be allowed. It always turns into argument and insult. We already know that for every opinion someone else will take the opposite view. A newspaper's view is its own, so let's keep it that way - we already know which way they lean politically. Keep opinions to social media and let people thrash it out there.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	There should be repercussions to extensive hate speech e.g a limited ban to the forum etc. Use moderators and ensure that users understand the consequences of hate speech commente
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	Firstly, newspapers need to enact a proper system of moderation. Blocking all comments infringes on free speech and does not allow readers to provide a counterpoint to the position provided in the article.
__label__noRel	the website could give raise this this awareness and have a open discusion	I think that the warning system is a good route, as the AI might eliminate valid arguments and miss hate speech accidentally. A warning system would still need an AI, but it warns users that their comment may be hate speech and if it is, the user can rethink their wording or risk posting it. If they post it, maybe a manual review can happen to determine if it was hate speech or not.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	we could filter the comments and have a panel to decide
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	hateful opinions are not opinions	It goes further than this. We live in a society that has a lot of cry babies. We need to be impervious to negative comments from strangers on a social platform and that is anonymous. Most people need to grow a pair, develop a spine or stop being cry babies. Once this is achieved you will see that any contribution you make to a discussion will be debated in a civilized manner.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	the best way to address hate speech to make it clear to the viewers regarding the consequence of hate speech. Also, only individuals who have registered on the platform after providing their details can be allowed to comment. furthermore, new accounts must be placed on a probation period and cannot be allowed to comment on the same day that they are created.
__label__noRel	I do not believe that the people writing hate comments on newspaper posts would spend time doing this, therefore, i feel like it would be a bad approach	Reduce hate speech by screening out certain words. If a comment contains such words, it is deleted or hidden from public view
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	The comment section must be cut off
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	While freedom of speech is a human right, it is imperative to be cognizant of the fact that each and every person has the right to have their rights respected. It is for this reason that readers comments cannot be removed. Everyone has the right to make a comment and we do not necessarily always have to agree, we always have to respect. A system can be put in place to remove any vulgar language.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	I think allowing some special space to allow it also would be helpful instead of cutting comments off.
__label__noRel	The law! People break the law through hate speech, so the law needs to be the judge.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	removing comments section is never going to encourage tolerance it is	Nowadays with the amount of social media platforms that are available newspapers don't hold as much power. We get all of our news through the spreading of news in social media as seen in this article : https://kettlemag.co.uk/social-media-versus-print-media/
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	Not allowing them to be anynymous might probably discourage some good-intentioned people to comment as well.	By having an algorithm that detects and deletes any hate speech comment.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	Freedom of speech is important - however hate speech is not important to debate
__label__noRel	comments don't need to involve hate speeck, one can comment without using these types of expressions,	people should have values and respect for others.Just like facebook written words are monitored and people already know these rules.A set of rules should be set
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	I think we have to use some fact checking system that allows us to present thoughts and opinions, the system can block derogatory comments. This allows for a calm debate
__label__noRel	Without the option for comments, the news providers become the sole voice of an opinion.	One solution to reduce hate speech is by disabling the comment section altogether for most important topics/controversial topics. Yu can actually leave the comment section open for generic topics/non-contoversial topics.
__label__noRel	I agree. As per 'The Free Speech Balancing Act of Digital Intermediaries: An explication of the concept of content governance' (Johnson, Brett (2015)' online news outlets face several competing duties: to promote free speech, to prevent harm, to obey the law, and to make money. Their entire business model relies on discourse and to prevent that is to deny readers/users the very service they claim to be providing. Some kind of voting system would allow harmful comments to be surpressed by the users themselves. It should really be left to the platforms themselves to figure out a way to manage potential hate speech (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00550-7#Sec4) through their own platforms as they have a responsibility to both limit harmful speech but keep discussion free and open.	The editor must appoint a diverse panel, meaning from different backgrounds to screen comments
__label__noRel	Yes I'm sure there is software that can do that.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	to disallow readers comments is an unnecessary response as these communities can still be found elsewhere	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Make readers agree to not sharing hate speech and let them know that if they do, they will be blocked from commenting.
__label__noRel	Allowing people to express their opinions ensures that there is free speech	Newspaper websites should implement ways such as word filters, moderators and more strict rules and regulations to prevent post that include hate speech to be minimised. They can also educate people about the dangers of hate speech. "Fight back against harmful messages in public places by publicly standing with victims in solidarity" https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/combat-onlin-hate-speech/
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	Maybe the only solution is to remove the space for comments? We see the same issues on other platforms that allow comments!
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	I think that definition of hatespeech needs to be laid out clearly as I think different people have different ideas on what constitutes hatespeech - perhaps if there was a kind of premediation that informs the user that what they are engaging in qualifies as hatespeech it may make them more likely to reconsider their messages introducing a form of self moderation as well as external moderation
__label__noRel	Yep. Rather implement ways in which one can refrain from hate speech	By making people aware that hate speech is not good by creating awareness campaigns against hate specch.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Hate speech is problematic. But I also think that it is not the newspapers' role to host a forum for comments. I understand that this is just moving the problem to other social media platforms, but I think journalists have better to do than spend their time moderating comments...	flag all the comments that contain vulgar words and warn the sender. the comment must be rephrased, failure to do so must result in the suspension of the sender from commenting
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	Punishments would be good but also a mixture of education and this could help. Hate speech is a very person-by-person thing, what some may think isn't, some may think is.	The comments could be examined for offensive language. For instance, there might be a robot that scans comments for offensive language and deletes them.
__label__noRel	people will find a way to comment horrible things elsewhere in newspapers	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.

__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	up to this point, moderators have done a poor job as evidenced by the amount of hate speech so maybe the answer is simply to remove the ability to comment.

__label__noRel	'Free speech' does not mean the freedom to hurt others. It isn't a licence to offend and should definitely be regulated.	The best way to reduce hate speech would be to make sure that moderators are present to check on comments, it would not be advisable to cancel comments completely due the feedback it gives and people will always have their opinions and sometimes they will involve hate speech, which is unavoidable...

Ultimately the comments are needed to gather feedback in certain situations, removing the comments section wouldn't help us eliminate hate speech because where information needs to be gathered, no blacklist will help.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	Although it might be unfair for others, I think majority can agree that removing the comment section will be helpful because then it means anyone that has an opinion can rather call the newspaper.
__label__noRel	One sided opinions	Allow others users to rate the comments and block those who receive bad ratings
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.

__label__noRel	people will be deterred to rely on information on newspapers if there are no guidelines regulating hate speech	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Totally agree with this. Raise awareness of the problem. Talk to friends about why hate speech is not a problem for the internet only but for our societies as well.	Hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by educating people about the consequences of hate speech and what they can do to someone else.
__label__noRel	I totaly agree, it will help to screen the comments in a way to avoid such incidences where people say things that can be hateful to another person. With the help of the technology i do belive this can be achieved in future to avoid being violated.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	The key way to do it would be with very in-depth moderation which is non-biased and respects criticisms but its aware when a comment is taken too far and viewed as hate speech. the comment section should not be eliminated but mainly moderated and supervised
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	Discussion can be encouraged, but so often it leads to hate speech / one sided arguments. There needs to be a moderator in place to delete / hide certain comments, so free speech is allowed, but hate speech is not.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	people feel powerful behind an anonymous account, its easier to say things you would never normally say under the guise of anonymity, if it was easier to link a comment to who it came from and if people actually faced consequences from posting hate then this could help stop it.
__label__noRel	true	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	I leave below a link to the study I mentioned above but was not able to attach and I am curious to hear what is others opinion. https://mediaengagement.org/research/journalists-and-online-comments/	People who take part in hate speech should be dealt with lawfully so as its a form of cyber-bullying, that way less people will resort to hate speech
__label__noRel	It could be tried	The is no need to moderate comments they must be dished out raw as they are writen by the readers
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	i agree, this would be useful as it can keep other comments	Research has shown that hate speech can be effectively controled since freedom of speech is not absolute
__label__noRel	Agree.

__label__noRel	would authors be held to account still?	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	eliminating the comment section is more like taking peoples freedoms away as people have the right to freedom of expression	By having an algorithm that detects and deletes any hate speech comment.
__label__noRel	I agree with you	I think that readers who use hate speech should be reported and temporarily banned from the site, as I believe that we need comments section in online newspaper articles. It is important to share your views as we have freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I feel this could lead to propagating false information through inclusion of poorly researched urls.	One cost-effective way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites while promoting reader comments is to outsource reader comments to social media. Comment sections can show comments for the article from social media platforms, while encouraging users to post comments onto these platforms. This way, hate speech can be reduced by social media platforms, which are more experienced with content moderation, have extensive rules in place, and have economies of scale with regard to content moderation compared to newspapers.
__label__noRel	Most readers don't know that comments are turned off https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/	Having read through the opinions of others, my stance has not completely changed. It is important to censor comments, freedom of speech does not always equate to disrespecting the views and opinions of others. While I agree that comments should be censored, I do not agree that every comment should be removed. As mentioned before, a system can be implemented that removes comments with certain words, thus making the comment section a safe space for all who use it.

__label__noRel	need to have a full time moderator	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	yes, I agree, need moderators,	I do not think it is possible, in a fair and just way. When speech is restricted that's called censorship. Who would justify the restrictive opinion?
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	We need to be very clear about what constitutes hate speech and create severe punishments for those that spread it.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	comments should be allowed on newspaper articles so that people can have a discussion and express their opinions, regulation would ultimately ensure that everything is kept in order.
__label__noRel	Sometimes being truthful can mean being harsh, but for the greater good.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	Moderators have biases as well which could result in a censorship of differing opinions that do not qualify as hate speech.	Maybe filter through comments
__label__noRel	I agree with both of these ideas. Having a moderation means consistency, but having other readers flag comments allows other commenters to hold peers to account and ensure that the comment section is an inclusive and fair section.	While freedom of speech is a human right, it is imperative to be cognizant of the fact that each and every person has the right to have their rights respected.

__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	I enjoy reading through comments and I don't think that they should be removed, but there should be a lot more monitoring going on to remove any hateful ones as soon as they are posted.
__label__noRel	I think that having these echo chambers just perpetuates what may be a cognitive dissonance, you may not necessarily feel a certain way but a comment you put out may have be interpreted one way and subsequent comments would reinforce that viewpoint in a polarised echo chamber. This website explains it nicely and uses racisms as an example of how cognitive dissonance perpetuates racist behaviour. https://www.reallifepsych.com/single-post/2017/08/16/the-psychology-of-cognitive-dissonance-and-racism	the best way is for companies to filter hate speech and remove it as long as the criteria for hate speech comes from an independent organisation. If companies themselves govern what is hate speech then we would become subject to there rules which you would lose the point of freedom of speech. Also there should be more support in the community for people who are being targeted in hate speech attacks.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	Newspaper comment spaces allow people the opportunity to share their opinions and feel that they can contribute their thoughts and ideas - it can also help readers engage with the content in a different way.
__label__noRel	On the other hand if platforms are held accountable, they may prefer to remove all comments sections, so as not to be punished themselves.	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	newspapers write viewpoint without reproach	Overall I think I agree with some of the mentions that removing the comments section does reduce freedom of speech. We should be allowed to comment and share opinions on any topic as long as it isn't hate speech.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	If we are to ban everyone who post a hateful comment we would be infringing on their basic right of freedom of speech. But the question still remains, when is it just a hateful comment and not hatred or propaganda. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression in press and other media.

__label__noRel	its nice to live in a kind society	I think that definition of hatespeech needs to be laid out clearly as I think different people have different ideas on what constitutes hatespeech - perhaps if there was a kind of premediation that informs the user that what they are engaging in qualifies as hatespeech it may make them more likely to reconsider their messages introducing a form of self moderation as well as external moderation

__label__noRel	It would be helpful because it would discourage people from leaving unpleasant messages as they could be identified personally.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words.

__label__noRel	but AI is still weak right now to filter hate speech comments efficiently	freedom of speech is essential but hate speech is not. comments should be left on but perhaps there could be a programme which finds key words and eliminates the comment if it seems to be hateful
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I agree	I agree that free speech should be honoured and upheld. That being said, newspapers are their own entities that should have autonomy over their interactions and comments from readers. Therefore, I think the use of moderators, filtering out certain offensive language, and strict and visible posting guidelines are good ways to reduce hate speech on these websites.
__label__noRel	i think they should have a filtering software to remove hate speech words and from being posted on the newspaper websites.	I think that things should be reviewed by a moderator, but it is a tough decision what is considered hate speech and what is someone's opinion.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea.

__label__noRel	Bringing Social Media into the discussion is irrelevant in my opinion. We're specifically talking about removing hate speech from newspaper websites. The whole point of social media is to present opinions, share your life etc A newspapers website should be a place for news to be disseminated	We need to block the users that use hate speech and filter the comments that have any form of hate speech.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Regulation of the newspaper comment section should be done.

__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	You would need to detect which accounts are using hate speech and ban them from writing posts
__label__noRel	I completely agree, the internet already needed policies to stop hate speech or insults.	Most people tend to respond aggressively when they know that they are anonymous because they think that they cannot be held accountable for their actions (https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-24373-001)

I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	I think that the website should develop a hate speech filtering software, to remove all offensive words that might be of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree that the hate speech perhaps should not be entirely removed. Sometimes a society has to confront its own ugliness/hatred head on, and removing it might do more harm than good (ie making commenters feel persecuted, perhaps making them even more hateful or violent). I also agree that still being able to access the newspaper might help change their minds.	While censoring certain words in the context of a comment would help reduce hate speech, an issue that would need to be considered is the use of images used as hate speech. Some "memes" can contain hate speech to the AI may misinterpret this as a regular image while the image could be posted as hate speech. An example of this is when people on Reddit use images as "memes" containing racism and sometimes the bot does not flag it as racism. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	Only People from certain age should be allowed to comment
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	lts true hate speech should be taken as positive criticism
__label__noRel	That seems very authoritative and draconic.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__noRel	Galliah, Shelly A would seem to agree	Proper moderation by the website owner should be required, whether using human moderators or using technology to flag potential hate speech for human review and action.

__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3394231.3397902
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	The difficulty with reducing hate speech, is that it is everywhere. It cannot feasibly be reduced with human power, but rather requires a computer system. The difficulty with an electronic system, is that it inherently requires money and financing, and therefore is incentivised to make money. When money is in the equation; thoughts, politics and ideas can be easily manipulated by those funding the system
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	using key words and having moderators might help
__label__noRel	It could help but would not solve the problem	hate speech is inevitable
__label__noRel	Whoever creates the algorithm then ultimately decides what is hate speech.

__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	ADD A HATE SPEECH DETECTOR
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	Alternatively I'd offer the opinion that goes against the question and states that we shouldn't offer a space for readers comments (and thus hate speech) at all on news since it's primarily a site and source for news. Systems like https://ground.news/ have been providing news and removing bias without a social aspect already and since third party social/sharing/commentary sites handle discussion and the problem of hate speech far better than newspaper websites presumably can hope to, the solution seems intuitive: remove it and let that happen organically on other websites and platforms.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	That would take away free speech, however I think they need to add some sort of AI that can immediately pick up any forms of hate speech and immediately delete or even block it
__label__noRel	But it also means that the newspaper will have full control over what is being posted and can filter certain opinions as well as hate speech to create a biased community look if they want to. Since they would never go on air, there would be no history of the page you can compare to.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	An article proving AI can be helpful, but can struggle to interpret or detect certain things, suggesting manual reviewing is still very important. https://www.latrobe.edu.au/nest/can-combat-rise-online-hate-speech/ On another note, I also think anonymity plays a huge role in what people allow themselves to post online and think that certain platforms should consider only allowing people to comment under their own identity rather than online handles and such.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	It is a tricky one to get the balance correct. There will always be some people in society who are happy to spout nonsense/hatred online as they sit behind a keyboard. At the same time, there will also be people who wish to share their more sensible and respectful views on topics.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	covering both sides is great but we should be able to be respectful towards eachother	You have to log on to write a comment, having character/post limits, comments must be verified by someone who checks for hate speech before approving the comment for publication

__label__noRel	I agree	I dont think it is a fair choice. For how long should people be silenced. Hate speech is always going to be around. Shutting people up is not going to stop hate speech.
__label__noRel	I Disagree, modern software technology is capable of knowing when to filter out post being made by the public. A system can be integrated as too where if a post achieves a certain threshold of flagged/reported tickets; there post would and can be immediately shut down.	I think that any 'contributors' should have a profile and should not be allowed to use an alias. I also think that there should be moderators looking at every post before it is published online.
__label__noRel	hate sppech exists wheather in a comments section or not	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	While I agree that hate speech is such, I feel like getting rid of the comment section would really go backwards and do more harm than good.	I think we need to develop a way to recognize hate speech in comments so that it is easy to monitor comment sections for derogatory and offensive language. There are studies on how to go about this for example if you follow this link it talks about "A Feature-Based Approach to Assess Hate Speech in User Comments" https://www.cairn.info/revue-questions-de-communication-2020-2-page-529.htm
__label__noRel	Robots cannot feel empathy or anything to distinguish between a regular comment and a comment containing hate speech.

__label__noRel	People may take advantage of this.	I don't think newspapers, who have already seen their takings plummet in recent years due to everything moving online, will want to pay to employ moderators for their articles. They would need to have a pretty high number of mods in order to keep up as each newspaper carries so many articles. This topic is a massive minefield and I don't think there is a simple solution to it.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	I think that readers who use hate speech should be reported and temporarily banned from the site, as I believe that we need comments section in online newspaper articles. It is important to share your views as we have freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	The creation of specific platforms to discuss this information often leads to groups with similar beliefs setting up their own platforms, which become a haven for hate speech and fake news	This is something that I think is impossible to do.

__label__noRel	Agree. it also highlights the need for work to be done on hate speech/racism. Just because the comments section isn't there, doesn't mean hate speech doesn't exist.	I think it'll be hard to do so, because everyone has the right to freedom of speech, but unless the comments brings acts of violence on people then it must be deleted

__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way.

So if a user uses language that promotes hate speech, the comment should be removed.

We do have to allow people to express their opinions - we can't pretend opinions don't exist. Having them out in the open lets us know what we're dealing with.

There is a role for AI (which I have said before I know) to try and weed out and remove anything that is just pure hate and not any sort of coherent argument or opinion.
__label__noRel	Newspaper articles are for delivering news not for people's opinion.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	This is a good idea, there are a lot of sites that use AI bots that block out hate speech, bad words, and they are more appropriate for all ages. Keeps the tone of the comments at a decent level	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	I completely agree, it will help avoid people posting offensive comments and allow the comment section space to be a space of productiveness where we learn what our fellow communities think about articles posted	Despite my defence of human moderators, it seems they too are flawed -- check out this article https://www.technologynetworks.com/informatics/news/ai-trusted-as-much-as-humans-to-flag-hate-speech-365777 -- human moderators are not only prone to bias but also impractical. With the huge wealth of content posted every second online, it is unrealistic to expect humans to be able to view, criticise, and moderate every single comment.
__label__noRel	yes i argree with this. it would not show that the newspaper is biased by leaving the positive comments only	In my opinion the comment section should not be removed. I personally get very annoyed if I watch or read something and want to express my opinion, then go down to the comment section to sadly find out the comments are turned off. This limits the freedom of speech and blocks the ability for the people to vent out somehow. I think this builds aggression and causes problems afterwards. The better thing to do is to limit bad speech, foul words and cursing but removing the comments completely is not a good idea.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	Hate speech is not at all the same as valid criticism.

__label__noRel	that might be too much work	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way.

__label__noRel	While I agree that hate speech is such, I feel like getting rid of the comment section would really go backwards and do more harm than good.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	Unmoderated online comment forums are magnets for noxious speech. For years they have carried people’s discontent out into the world, while the writers sit safely behind screens. It’s almost bittersweet to think back on the time we once blamed internet flaming on the online disinhibition of middle school pranksters. It is the many unhappy adults in the electorate who are posting the things they are really thinking in comment boxes. Nearly three-quarters of internet users – 73 percent – have witnessed online harassment. News website comment sections host antagonistic conversations between contributors. Nine out of 10 respondents of a Pew Research study said the online environment was more enabling of criticism. The squabbling can be overwhelming: As many as 34 percent of news commenters and 41 percent of news comment readers identified argumentative comments as the reason they avoid reading or joining the discourse. Multiple studies show online communities develop sophisticated norms that guide participants. Anger begets more anger. Unshackled digital vitriol is now volleyed back and forth online from all sides. Some commenters don’t even care if they are anonymous anymore. Researchers have found real-name comments on social media are actually nastier than unsigned commentary. Historically, American democracy always had some rudeness baked into it. For example, during the presidential election of 1800, incumbent President John Adams’ campaign proclaimed “murder, robbery, rape, adultery and incest will all be openly taught and practiced” if his opponent, Thomas Jefferson, won the presidency. Jefferson, meanwhile, described Adams as “a hideous hermaphroditical character,” with “neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman.” Civility in public discourse is often what people in power expect of their citizens. Demands for civility can be used by those with authority to deny power to those with none. People who feel marginalized or alienated use incivility and civil disobedience to fight the power. By causing offense and indignation, as we saw during Campaign 2016, outsiders gained massive attention for their cause. Yet “democracy only functions when its participants abide by certain conventions, certain codes of conduct and a respect for the process,” wrote cultural journalist Neal Gabler in an eloquent essay about how a hateful electorate threatens democracy. Gabler noted that the 2016 presidential campaign was referred to as the “hate election” because everyone professed to hate both candidates. It turned out to be the hate election, Gabler mused, “because of the hatefulness of the electorate.” He went on:	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed.

__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others.

__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	we should keep comment sections on newspaper websites but we should have moderators to filter out any hate speech
__label__noRel	I think this intrudes on free speech and is a danger to moderating certain things the newspaper might not want to be affiliated with.	have an active moderator to remove any hate speech
__label__noRel	lowers the risk of hate speech being needed	AI could be used to flag hate speech, meaning comments that are hate speech can be flagged at the time. The tech needs more work though based on this article: https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/04/1025742/ai-hate-speech-moderation/
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	We need to let people have their opinions spoken. Removing the comment space is not a good option. Instead, we need to better educate people on what's good and what's bad.
__label__noRel	Newspapers are nationally available.As are there websites.Whilst newspapers cant be held responsible for the comments of its readers ,i do think they should have a moderater to delete harmfull posts that could offend.	Hate speech blocking will violate human rights to freedom of speech and cause people to feel opressed, as that would mean that they can not voice out their opinions.

Also, only individuals who have registered on the platform after providing their details can be allowed to comment. furthermore, new accounts must be placed on a probation period and cannot be allowed to comment on the same day that they are created.
__label__noRel	Would benefit society more in long term.	The comment section needs to be moderated using some kind of filter to automatically filter any words on the banned list and then use a report system to flag up anything which tries to bypass this. This will allow a human moderator to quickly decide what can be kept and what needs action.
__label__noRel	It will eliminate hate speech	There needs to be a moderator who is reviewing the comments that are made, I see a lot of inappropriate comments posted to news stories on the comments section of the news articles on facebook that incite arguments and hate speech. This is not acceptable and should not be allowed to happen.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.

__label__noRel	yes. good moderators are the key	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words.

Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	Although free speech is important, there is a lot of scientific evidence showing that hate speech, bullying and dehumanising language can do harm to individuals it is aimed at.	I think we firstly have to call out hate speech in order for people to learn that it is not okay and unacceptable. The reason being online 'haters' tend to abuse their right to free speech such that it infringes upon the next person because they have the comfort of knowing that nobody will find put who they really are and confront them. By calling out users on the newspaper website and responding to their comment as the moderator of the comments, and actually suspending their accounts because of it can go a long way.
__label__noRel	Its not fair, I believe its best to leave comment bar available to everyone because freedom of speech is still and thing and some who practice hate speech might be educated by another. Instead of leting one person practice hate speech elsewhere its best discussed and dealt with there and then. Something hate speech happenes dure to lack of knowledge.	I have no real interest in reading readers comments sections in newspapers, but I don't agree that they should be eliminated. The content can be moderated to remove hate speech. This be done by a moderator, or these days, by AI.
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	readers comments be moderated and anything that is harmful, hateful or hurtful should be removed. this allows people to exercise their right of freedom of speech but limiting the harm that someones opinion may have
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	Hate speech can be controlled by blacklisting keywords on the search engine of a particular blog post/newspapers which will delete any comments that may contain any of the blacklisted keywords.
__label__noRel	What is considered free speech (and should therefor be allowed) depends heavily on the location of the platform and the user. In the US free speech is protected by law to a much greater extend than in Europe. In the US there are only a few categories of speech not protected by the First Amendment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_free_speech_exceptions), like incitement to lawless action. In Europe however free speech stops there where it infringes on someone else their rights, for example the right to not be discriminated against. Racism and targeted hate for that reason is not protected by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights) or the national laws of many of the European countries.	comment sections are necessary so we can see different opinions on one topic
__label__noRel	most comment sections usually generate comments that turn into arguements if unmoderated	I feel that people should be allowed to have freedom of expression online but should be held accountable for vitriolic and unbased hate speech, this could be achieved by proving identity and by using citations and references when posting online
__label__noRel	Perhaps we could create a team whose job is to moderate comments, and they can be paid for what they do? In terms of flagging, we might create a questionnaire asking them what exactly is hateful about the comment.	A system should be developed to detect certain words that are considered as hate speech. This will help prevent or eliminate hate speech comments
__label__noRel	may help to maintain a self space	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	Hate speech is not free speech when it can lead to attacks on people and how they choose to live their lives.	Newspapers should be a pleasure to read and not make you angry after reading comments not having comments will make them more pleasurable to read again.
__label__noRel	I think it demonstrates clearly how often AI struggles to detect hate speech or misclassifies innocent content as hateful - it would just further restrict freedom of speech.	I think one way to reduce hate speech online would be monitoring the message. If someone writes a message, it should be checked before allowing it to be posted, it could be done by a simple program where the computer looks for offensive words.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	you cannot eliminate it. dont try. freedom of speech is importante and we must appreciae others have different view
__label__noRel	but the newspaper cannot be liable for how people respond,considering that most website are visited by adults with responsibilities.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	reduces freedom of speech	We can have a system where every comment has to be checked and vetted for hate speech and if it infringes on any of the platform's rules and regulations then the comment is automatically removed.

__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	we could filter the comments and have a panel to decide
__label__noRel	Yes this is a sensible solution to this problem	The pros of removing comment sections would be to eradicate the spreadof hate speech. Certain individuals thrive on adding fuel to fire. In this case having the comment section deleted would be a positive thing. On the other hand only by having differing opinions can discussions and debates happen. So if someone spews hate speech only then can we see the extent to which someone disagrees with a certain group/viewpoint etc. https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	i think people need to be educated better about what Hate Speech is.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	There is a careful balance to be made between protecting others from the effects of hate speech and protecting free speech. Online hate speech unfortunately can have the effect of increasing violence against minorities (https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons) but blocking all free speech because of the actions of a few seems like a poor decision. More must be done to remove hate speech online quickly and this means spending more money tackling it.
__label__noRel	We cannot rely to other people to recognize hate	I have already said that people who have already displayed hate speech on a website should be banned from giving their opinion.
__label__noRel	Stops people with genuine none discriminatory opinions to express themselves	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	To ensure freedom of speech is still maintained, moderation needs to be carried out fairly. To achieve this, we need to understand what is hate speech and what are the lines that seperate that with constructive criticism. Attached is an article by the Standford encyclopedia of physiosphy regarding hate speech. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hate-speech/
__label__noRel	Guidelines and some automation (i.e. flagging the use of key words associated with hate speech, including swear words and racist nomenclature) could work.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	I completely agree. It's not the job of online sites to become speech police. I frequent many different online comment sections, and oddly enough, hateful comments are swiftly dealt with by other contributors. Sometimes the best way to eliminate hate speech, is to allow it to be seen, then vastly condemned by those seeing it. Algorithms should be used to deal with trolling. Honest, sometimes brutal comments should not censored just because they make others uncomfortable.	You should be allowed to give your opinion to express your view about a news article. To moderate this or to filter what you can and cannot say would it stop it from being free speech. What really needs to be looked at is to see how you can stop online trolling which I think is the root cause of some of these comment sections become so toxic. But for the media who is so depended on free speech themselves so that they can report on news in an unbiased way to eliminate the comment space is almost hypocritical. Just a weird idea here but perhaps you should do a quick test or verification before you can comment. A lot of people would not go through the effort of completing this if they just want to spread hate.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	The vast majority of digital news consumers - that is 76% in America, read comments sections. This means by removing them were missing a big chance at limiting the harmful effects of echo chambers and encouraging consumers to think critically and question things
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	I agree that moderating the comment section with flagged phrases that automatically send comments for quick moeration would be a good solution.

__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way.

__label__noRel	If the information was moderated & hidden if deemed to be hate speech then it would still exist for the purposes of feedback but not be visible within the comments section	I agree that free speech should be honoured and upheld. That being said, newspapers are their own entities that should have autonomy over their interactions and comments from readers. Therefore, I think the use of moderators, filtering out certain offensive language, and strict and visible posting guidelines are good ways to reduce hate speech on these websites.
__label__noRel	I feel like this would be the mos t ideal solution.	have word filters
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	It is true that it would be difficult to remove and control all of the comments however i think it would be a lot more damaging to remove the right to freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	Hate speech blocking should not be implemented, people must learn to take some criticism in a positive way, it can be helpful.

__label__noRel	I think this is a good idea, I would start with education, if that is not helping then restricting the person from commenting.	The difficulty with moderation is that it is subjective - if done so via human moderation if there is no existing framework to follow particular viewpoints or comments may not be seen to be worthy of removing though for others this may not be the case. If moderating is done so by filtering words or with no human intervention, over-moderation is a risk. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2056305119832588

__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Hate speech should be taken as a form of free speech. If it degrades or inflicts harm on another individual if should not be regarded as hate speech	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	I think the main things to ensure are: - Taking away the option for anonymous accounts - Having a screening process - Giving users the ability to flag comments they think are innapropriate	Discussion can be encouraged, but so often it leads to hate speech / one sided arguments. There needs to be a moderator in place to delete / hide certain comments, so free speech is allowed, but hate speech is not.
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	https://eachother.org.uk/would-removing-social-media-anonymity-protect-or-threaten-our-rights/ Perhaps hate comments could be reduced by removing the ability to post comments anonymously?
__label__noRel	Sadly not everyone can be polite enough to express themselves without the use of hate speech, hence such people should be blocked as we cannot tolerate it.	I believe if we can be on the same page and let the media tell the story the truth with out lashing out on it.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	If the aim is merely to reduce hate speech then I think eradicating the comment section goes too far. Why should people not be allowed to comment and have their say. The newspaper is punishing the public for the crimes of a few. It seems rather unfair. I think the best method is to have monitors.
__label__noRel	I totaly agree, it will help to screen the comments in a way to avoid such incidences where people say things that can be hateful to another person. With the help of the technology i do belive this can be achieved in future to avoid being violated.	There should be automatic filters but they are not 100, so there should also be a team of people constanly monitoring and reviewing complaints and reports. I feel like it is the only way to keep the freedom of speech but also protect people who might be victims of it.
__label__noRel	Makes sense	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	Comment spaces should be moderated, perhaps even approved before posting.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	there must be a way to build in logarithms to find certain words or phrases
__label__noRel	It would reduce hate comments to the max.	As I saw some commentary on this platform, my opinion is that we need 2 things. A submission of personal data before one can have access to post anything related and real time moderation of the comments. Big platforms like YouTube, Instagram and others are held accountable for their users' actions and they have had a lot of success so far. Source: https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/combat-online-hate-speech/
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	Better real-time monitoring of posts, either by AI or human monitoring (or combination of both). Another way is to reuire ID to sign up so as each comment is linked to someone who can be identified. This would surely reduce the instances of hate speech, and help catch those who take part in such hate speech.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	There needs to be rules and regulations stating the type of comments that can be made about other people. There should also be verification of a persons identity everytime they make a comment so that is visible who the statement was made by. Newspaper articles should constantly ready and delete hate speech comment.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Having moderators remove hateful speech and providing better education.
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	People who take part in hate speech should be dealt with lawfully so as its a form of cyber-bullying, that way less people will resort to hate speech
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	I think that education is the way to go about it, Humans must respect opposing views of others and tolerant society should be encouraged at all times instead of censorship
__label__noRel	It could help but would not solve the problem	Just pay moderators
__label__noRel	It is difficult to moderate in a completely unbiased way and it would not be right for moderation to influence opinion.	I think we have to use some fact checking system that allows us to present thoughts and opinions, the system can block derogatory comments. This allows for a calm debate
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	To ensure freedom of speech is still maintained, moderation needs to be carried out fairly. To achieve this, we need to understand what is hate speech and what are the lines that seperate that with constructive criticism. Attached is an article by the Standford encyclopedia of physiosphy regarding hate speech. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hate-speech/
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	I disagree with the stance of doing away with the comment section in its entirety, it goes against the premise of media which is to spark a debate or discussion.
__label__noRel	I agree, the comment section should likely remain but be heavily moderated and regulated to disallow hate speech as the article above says	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	No-one should have to spend their time filtering out the disgusting things human beings are capable of saying about each other. Nobody has a right to comment on anything.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	I agree to some extent. I think there are some obvious exceptions but otherwise anytime someone disagrees they can say they find it offensive or hateful and want it removed. You can't exist in a happy thoughts only bubble	Provide guidance on what is and isnt hate speech would work i think
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	It is not fair if newspapers take away the comment space. I do not consider this to be fair choice in a supposed democratic society/
__label__noRel	I agree	Moderation is necessary. Closing comments is not the answer, as communication can help people to understand each other's viewpoints. If you take comments away because you're afraid of hate speech, you're going to be creating a barrier between you and your audience.
__label__noRel	I agree it would be a good solution better than moderators because moderators are humans and they can make mistakes.	The most surprising position was to completely eliminate the comments section. various studies have been conducted in this regard and they all agree on one thing and that deleting comments is not a good idea and can damage the general perception of the outlet. https://mediaengagement.org/research/how-the-public-views-deletion-of-offensive-comments/
__label__noRel	I think that removing the comment section on specific topics is important	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	create an algorithm that identifies hate speech and removes it
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	By outright banning IP addresses which contribute hate speech to platforms, and investing in moderation through human resources and through text analysis tools.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	Making the rules up front is definitely a good idea and I agree that the comments need to be moderated in order to enforce those rules.	Registering with ID is the single step that would improve incidences of hate speech in comments section. That coupled with live moderation either by AI or human, and following rules that can quickly adapt to change should greatly rduce hate speech.
__label__noRel	It's important not to confuse freedom of speech and hate speech: "freedom" can be a dangerous weapon when you use it to attack others for their identity.	In as much as we can not let the spread of hate speech continue, closing the comment section is not the solution. The newspaper website should have the option for readers to be able to report comments that include hate speech and moderators should be appointed to check "users" that are violating the rules. There can be filters in place that remove posts that have some of the common hateful and derogatory phrases. outlining the rules and regulations for the website users can help
__label__noRel	Agreed! Probably can never get rid of it completely but taking steps to reducing it is 100% needed!	moderating the comments would surely help
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	While censoring certain words in the context of a comment would help reduce hate speech, an issue that would need to be considered is the use of images used as hate speech. Some "memes" can contain hate speech to the AI may misinterpret this as a regular image while the image could be posted as hate speech. An example of this is when people on Reddit use images as "memes" containing racism and sometimes the bot does not flag it as racism. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Censor out words
__label__noRel	I think so too. But would that not further allow for subjectivity to cloud ones judgement(the moderator)? I propose there be a guideline set as to what qualifies for hate speech, both by law and by the standards of the newspaper. That guideline should be posted in the newspaper or on the social media platforms and that will ensure that there is no grey area on the matter.	In addition to reducing hate speech by site moderation community moderation could also take place having the ability to flag a post for the attention of moderators which violates terms of service.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	An algortithm can provide a cheap and effective solution that is available 24/7 to moderate	The comments section may be removed on especially conflicting topics/conversations.
__label__noRel	This may negatively impact the public. As newspapers may publish news in a manner deceiving the truth and those who are not aware would believe lies.	I believe the comment section should be open to all to express their opinions.We need freedom of speech. Hate speech can be ignored. But it is important to show the view of all.
__label__noRel	Commenting on online platforms with hate speech is a lazy, cowardly way of spreading negativity. If those who partake in this sort of online behaviour lacked the platform to do this, I don't think they would act out in other ways. I think they spread hate online as it's a very easy way to do so and takes no energy and is anonymous.	I think you can put a price to the website- a subscription to readers.
__label__noRel	Sometimes, in the context of a debate, aggressive language is necessarily to demonstrate the emotion of the people and their dissatisfaction	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button	Moderating comments sections is a lot of work to do manually, the individuals tasked with it would burn out in short time trying to manage that effectively while also having to read hateful garbage all day. If there was a system to remove hate speech it needs to be automated with an algorithm that catches certain words, then reviewed manually when someone disagrees with the content removed and it not being against guidelines. We use guidelines for everything including media regulations for accurate reporting or having to retract when information is not accurate. It's no different in the comments section, it doesn't remove free speech it regulates it to create a healthy environment to have a conversation in. Over moderation can have as severe of an effect as under, it has to be a system that takes in common complaints from both sides. Not the hate speech side per say but the sides of people who are pro free flowing conversation and those who want more shielding to avoid extremist echo chambers.
__label__noRel	I think the fact that Facebook, one of the richest companies in the world, struggle with moderation points to the fact that small local newspapers would struggle. Especially if one of their stores goes viral or something.	Having moderators remove hateful speech and providing better education.
__label__noRel	Less hate speech	human rights of the masses should not be violated regardless of their beliefs and views
__label__noRel	Should reduce hate speech and other inappropriate comments	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	I agree with this. They are quite good nowdays and can be used accurately to spot mature language	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	Only People from certain age should be allowed to comment
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	I'm of the supporting view that the use of AI to filter out Hate speech could prove to be very useful
__label__noRel	"Comments are often regarded as a right but they can do more harm than good. In the absence of strict moderation, we’d be much better off without them"	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	we could use bots the get triggered when certain words are used. The bot will therefore remove the comment andhold it until it has mannually reviewed by a human. Another option can be to allow the users to report comments from other users and if the reports reach a certain threshold then hold that comment for review.
__label__noRel	However, some people may unfortunately not want to be educated and may still believe this stuff, but in that case no amount of removing comments, hate speech or education would help them, so they're already a lost cause.	lts true hate speech should be taken as positive criticism
__label__noRel	The only time I think it is good to eliminate comments, is if the target is harmed psychologically by it. But I do think it could be policed in some way to offset this.	AI could be used to flag hate speech, meaning comments that are hate speech can be flagged at the time. The tech needs more work though based on this article: https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/04/1025742/ai-hate-speech-moderation/
__label__noRel	This was a great way to show what will happen to free speech	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	Comment sections have become so ingrained in the news website experience that their removal will at first seem almost an affront to free speech.	A moderated comments section can solve this problem. Freedom of speech does not need to include hate speech. An opinion can be given that doesn't include hate speech in it.
__label__noRel	Totally agree	"Freedom of Speech'...that's a popular consensus among the masses, regardless of the "casualities" that are left on the wayside. Having reread a lot of the comments posted here, I do consider the possibility of having people comment as they wish, politically correct or not. HOWEVER, let there be consequences involved, such as naming and shaming, and acquring user details if need be, after all, things such as cyber crime, online harrassment, etc do exist, am I right? And so, if such a comment borders on this, let it become a criminal matter and have law enforcement dealing specifically in cyber-related crimes become involved. Problem solved.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	Should be reviewed first before it gets published
__label__noRel	I agree	Yes there must be a a strong policy for reviewal before publishing.
__label__noRel	Simultaneously limits freedom of opinion. A censored comment section can hinder thought-provoking discussions	Hate-speech is part of free-speech, it's hard to focus on one without affecting the other so what should be done is to write articles differently, a neutral way where both sides can see themselves because we become less aggressive when we feel part of a group
__label__noRel	Hate speech is some fairly clear definitions, particularly around race and gender [https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech], so it really shouldn't be hard to identify clearly offensive comments directed at a person or group of persons, over valid criticism. The only danger is if the moderator is also biased and does not like an opinion, but in these cases, an independent review will clearly show an abuse of moderator power.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	In order to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. Active communinty management and moderation is required. This helps keep people in line with the community guildelines.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	My final argument is that it is possible to monitor and reduce hate speech on website comments by using both AI and human intelligence
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	they need to as often it is minorities which are affected
__label__noRel	I agree	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Only People from certain age should be allowed to comment
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	I think that education with penalties such as exclusion from the community for repeated offences is the best policy. Like many I agree that some people are unaware they unaware they have caused offence to others.
__label__noRel	Who gets to decide what constitutes a 'controversial topic'? This is still a form of censorship and should not be allowed.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	Could ensure moderation of commonly used words for hate speech, and frequent moderation on these websites
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	Strict moderation of comments prior to them being published may be the only way to limit hate speech on comments sections.
__label__noRel	I agree with this, or some coding introduced in the background somehow to not even allow bad comments/words to be posted at all.	Could ensure moderation of commonly used words for hate speech, and frequent moderation on these websites
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	I think that only people who provided identifying information can post their opinions. Also I agree that there should be AL tools to prevent hate speech. Eliminating hate speech from newspaper websites has nothing to do with the infringement of the free speech right.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	Newspapers by their nature are polarised entities. Banning comments to diminish polarised opinions makes little sense if the newspapers themselves are pumping out polarised opinions.	Removing the comment space from online newspapers is definitely not fair but I believe that it should be regulated by A-I. This way readers could share different opinions and thoughts abut the topic at hand without offending one another.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	We can have a system where every comment has to be checked and vetted for hate speech and if it infringes on any of the platform's rules and regulations then the comment is automatically removed.
__label__noRel	I think this already happens on some sites (flagging offensive comments) and is a good way of ensuring any comments which may offend someone, can be moderated and removed if necessary.	Having read all of the previous discussion surrounding this debate, I still stand by my original opinion. Moderating comments by an official representative of the newspaper doesn't allow for free speech. We do however, need to eliminate hate speech. I think the best way to do this is to put this in the hands of the community and other readers.
__label__noRel	There is always going to be fake news, thats what sells. Hate speech is not the same as voicing an opinion.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	This project takes the approach of counterspeech, whereby hateful comments are not removed, but instead responded to with alternative, police and non-aggressive comments. https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/counterspeech-better-way-tackling-online-hate
__label__noRel	I agree with this	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	I agree!	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	yes. good moderators are the key	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	Good Argument but at the same time we must look at how it affect people live most people commit suised because of hate speech	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Allow for a voting system on the comments, so as the cream rises to the top and the dredges sink away.
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	Reduce hate speech by screening out certain words. If a comment contains such words, it is deleted or hidden from public view

__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship.

__label__noRel	I agree with you but there would have to be a lot of work put into the filters as people do get around them and still are able to make their hateful points using text speak or misspelling ever so slightly. This is just something that would have to be considered.	I believe that people are allowed to express their opinions , that is why we have freedom of speech. However with that right, we are not subjected to hate speech, there are so many ways of expressing yourself without using offensive or hateful words. Considering a newspaper is a public platform, I believe everyone should try to be respective at all times. The comment space must not be removed, it helps to get insights of readers and is very helpful. I think the website should be enhanced in a way that it detects offensive language and doesn't allow the reader to continue if they use such. Also, comments should be monitored before being posted to the public.
__label__noRel	The public are not experts and their views should not be publicised as such.	Is it actually their responsibilty?
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	I enjoy reading through comments and I don't think that they should be removed, but there should be a lot more monitoring going on to remove any hateful ones as soon as they are posted.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	I agree that moderating the comment section with flagged phrases that automatically send comments for quick moeration would be a good solution.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	It is a tricky one to get the balance correct. There will always be some people in society who are happy to spout nonsense/hatred online as they sit behind a keyboard. At the same time, there will also be people who wish to share their more sensible and respectful views on topics.
__label__noRel	I agree. This could prevent uninformed comments which usually lead to hate speech.	I think the best option would be to put some moderators that are educated about hateful speeches and let them see comments before they are online so that they can decide to approved them or not. They are doing it in Germany (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793)
__label__noRel	If the platform is held accountable for allowing hateful speech, then this would set an example to others, both platforms and people, and eventually there would be more control over this happening freely.	It seems like many users think that having your personally details posted along with your comment would be a deterrent for people to comment hate speech
__label__noRel	yes. good moderators are the key	I think that education is the way to go about it, Humans must respect opposing views of others and tolerant society should be encouraged at all times instead of censorship
__label__noRel	I actually really like this idea - it deals well with the issue of removing hate speech as nothing just gets automatically published and checked later. Yes it will cut down on the amount of comments overall but even that isn't a bad thing, if only the most coherent, high-quality comments are published.	There should be no comment area in order to limit hate speech. Newspapers should be one-sided sources of information.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	The moderation can be subject to the Moderator's own thoughts/opinions.	people must change, not internet/website
__label__noRel	Yes, I think that readers can also downvote a comment or flag it so that it can be brought to the moderator's attention and they should take action within a specified time frame.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	I agree, however the issue then becomes 'How do we go about finding the root cause '	ADD A HATE SPEECH DETECTOR
__label__noRel	The whole point of comment sections is so that people can provide their opinion on what they've seen/read, stopping this only minimizes debate and being able to view differing opinions. This then leads to break off groups choosing to use other platforms and thus having platforms with polar opinions which can be dangerous as people could be exposed to only one viewpoint	agree with not deleting comments, we should live it open and just regulated
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	Reduce hate speech by screening out certain words. If a comment contains such words, it is deleted or hidden from public view
__label__noRel	Yes, public should also be able to express an opinion on a subject.	Moderating comments is a far better method than eliminating comments entirely. I feel a method for reporting comments, though not perfect, is better, and then reported comments can be examined and removed if necessary.
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	I found this really interesting, "Khan said the freedom of opinion and expression, including the right to seek, receive and disseminate diverse sources of information, must be upheld by States in times of crises and armed conflict as a precious ‘survival right’ on which people’s lives, health, safety, security and dignity depend." This is similar to what lots of people have been saying regarding worrying that this sort of censorhip could overextend. (https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/10/protect-freedom-expression-vital-survival-right-civilians-armed-conflict-un)
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	rules for discussion could be posted before giving the access, mention that chat moderators are following all discussions and hate speech will be removed if occures.
__label__noRel	Regardless of training, unconscious and conscious biases will be introduced regardless as the moderators are human.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	The requirement of a phone number is a reasonable one, but might restrict participation (i.e. there will be people who are unable or unwilling to give their phone number just to comment on a newspaper website). An alternative approach could be to enforce a 'waiting time' from account creation to the ability to post comments? This would prevent repeat offenders from simply creating new accounts after they were banned	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	should be open to all
__label__noRel	agree	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	I think newspapers websites should introduce a bot that would delete automatically all posts that have too many hate words in it.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	Have a moderator than overlooks all readers comments and makes sure they're all suitable.
__label__noRel	I agree	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	some ideas are extreme and inconsiderate	Removing the comment section will only create a bigger revolt and uprise from people that write hate speech, and it will move to another media outlets. So the problem should be treated not silenced it. It is the responsibility of newspapers websites to police hate speech in order to create a safe environment for an healthy discussion about a news article. Otherwise you are cutting short an experience that users might want to have. So by censoring all the comment section your make erverybody pay a price for something that they haven't done. Moderation is the key and should be done my the newspapers websites according to the values they have.
__label__noRel	Media isn't about sparking debate it's about catching our attention, profiting off our attention and sharing their biased view with us. Some countries have tighter regulations for media than others as well, plus they write salacious headlines for sale knowing people won't always read the full text of the article. They cause the polarization in conversation.	the best way is for companies to filter hate speech and remove it as long as the criteria for hate speech comes from an independent organisation. If companies themselves govern what is hate speech then we would become subject to there rules which you would lose the point of freedom of speech. Also there should be more support in the community for people who are being targeted in hate speech attacks.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Use technology to monitor and block users
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	A combination of a warning system, detailing what might be considered hate speech and a manual review if potential hate speech is detected as well as on manual reports (allowing brief descriptions for reasons for reporting) seems like a good way to go about it. People who have a history of posting more than one hate comment on the platform should be moderated each time before their comment gets publicised whether it's detected as hate speech by the algorithm or not. They would lose the privilege of being able to comment instantly without review.
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	People who take part in hate speech should be dealt with lawfully so as its a form of cyber-bullying, that way less people will resort to hate speech
__label__noRel	Hoping that they may publish is wishful thinking as well unless they have a system for it.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	Moderators are useful but they will have their own bias and we cannot guarntee that they will be impartial, thus we remain in the same position	You have to log on to write a comment, having character/post limits, comments must be verified by someone who checks for hate speech before approving the comment for publication
__label__noRel	not giving much attention to certain issues can lessen hate speech	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	Less hate speech	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	I agree	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	The most surprising position was to completely eliminate the comments section. various studies have been conducted in this regard and they all agree on one thing and that deleting comments is not a good idea and can damage the general perception of the outlet. https://mediaengagement.org/research/how-the-public-views-deletion-of-offensive-comments/
__label__noRel	When people are given choice to comment, trolls will come out naturally and therefore so will hate speech. You can only educate those willing to be educated.	Newspaper websites should implement ways such as word filters, moderators and more strict rules and regulations to prevent post that include hate speech to be minimised. They can also educate people about the dangers of hate speech. "Fight back against harmful messages in public places by publicly standing with victims in solidarity" https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/combat-onlin-hate-speech/
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	More control by moderators plus a code of conduct for users
__label__noRel	True	I don't think it's helpful to cancel the comment space completely, we should have the ability to post our thoughts.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	Sometimes newspapers are very skewed and/or publish incorrect information. This approach would make it harder for people to question facts and stats/the content provided.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	Stops the bullying and people feeling bad	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.

__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Having a screaning for all comments before they go up on the platform to make sure that they are not posted on the site.
__label__noRel	Differing opinions mare easily recognized for what they are. Whereas as hate speech can spark a lot of dangerous events. The comment's section helps people share knowledge easily and if it's not serving that purpose then it should not be allowed. https://researchoutreach.org/articles/hate-speech-regulation-social-media-intractable-contemporary-challenge/	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	I agree, having it flagged and hidden until review is fair. If the comments section has clear rules then its easy to moderate if a comment broke them or not instead of it being subjective or based on opinion	It must me a government's responsibility to implement policies against hate speech.https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-to-combat-fake-news-and-disinformation/
__label__noRel	Agree. Certain words can be filtered and if triggered comment can be removed	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Filter words so if a comment contains this word it will be reviewed as to if it is appropriate or automatically deleted
__label__noRel	True, but not every criticism is valid	i think a law should be made that if you do not delete hate speech from your website or article than that newspaper will have to pay a fine.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	In my opinion the comment section should not be removed. I personally get very annoyed if I watch or read something and want to express my opinion, then go down to the comment section to sadly find out the comments are turned off. This limits the freedom of speech and blocks the ability for the people to vent out somehow. I think this builds aggression and causes problems afterwards. The better thing to do is to limit bad speech, foul words and cursing but removing the comments completely is not a good idea.
__label__noRel	we can never be sure when it comes to people. It will be dangerous should people be allowed to express themselves	This article describes how censoring might lead users to leave platforms and join other platforms with lighter censoring rules https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/global-extremes/does-censoring-radical-right-social-media-work/
__label__noRel	Education is k ey!	The comment section needs to be moderated using some kind of filter to automatically filter any words on the banned list and then use a report system to flag up anything which tries to bypass this. This will allow a human moderator to quickly decide what can be kept and what needs action.
__label__noRel	Moderator cannot always be reliable	I see that most people have the same idea as I have of having moderated. I did not think about what the guidelines could be and how censoring could be a contributing factor to my stand on having comments moderated, but it still seems like the best solution.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	I believe that punishment would cause more polarization because people may have more negative feelings towards newspaper websites with comments sections. Like what AllisonK said, education is a better preventative measure. If punishment is necessary, it should involve education that the commentator actively engages in.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.

__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	Have them reviewed after they are posted and do not allow them to be viewed before they are revied, as well as keeping tabs on the user posting the comments.
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	Just pay moderators
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	The comment section must be cut off
__label__noRel	some checks but again what filter are we going to use to ensure we have limits as people will censor easily too	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	Crowdsource moderation is a great idea, similar to reddit where people can vote, but there are still moderators who can remove posts completely if they break sub rules	have an admin or moderator remove inappropriate comments.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	I know this has been discussed a few times potentially in reply to comments but I'd like to repeat it again: language is complex and you can't simply ban or flag certain terms or phrases and think you catch all the hate speech comments etc. While a report button and the use of a software that can support a human moderator is in essence a good idea, it might also delete comments that do not actually contain HS or completely miss others overall. I think this decision by the newspaper turned into an entire discussion of manageability of monitoring discussion sections and away from the ethical considerations.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	the comment section is for sharing information and opinions without the need of hate speech. those who promote and share hate speech should get banned from the comment section
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	By implimenting a system that can filter out all comments before the comments are added to the website or newspaper for the readers to read
__label__noRel	Potentially reduces correction or dissenting information on the article	I think rather than removing the option to comment/debate below an article, there could be moderators and hate speech buttons and bots to keep hate speech at bay.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	the removal of comment spaces is not good for the well being of humans because other people share ideas using the comment space and other comments can make certain people happy.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	i do not agree with the method of doxxing people. hate speech has always existed, it is now on a more global scale because the world is more centralised as a result of social media. i believe the solution is censorship and moderation which sites like reddit and youtube already preactise.
__label__noRel	This would be really hard to put into practice. I believe people should have the freedom to remain anonymous as long as they are respecful of others.	Our freedom to do anything as part of a society is limited. Thus freedom of speech should be no different. Poeple need to be held accountable for their mistakes, so everybody else's rights will be protected. So having a set of keywords which are not allowed to be used is a way of reminding the writter that using the offensive word he/she is trying to use is considered a crime. An additional way to handle that is having the flag option by users and a team of moderators who follow a standard and will verify if flagged comments should be maintained or not. Lastly, anonymity might bring a feeling of impunity and even its possibility, so a way to avoid that is allowing one profile per person/email, where a fake username can be set, but, in the backstage, the website will know who it is that wrote each comment.
__label__noRel	anyone writing things against the prevailing narrative will be shut down. George Orwell wrote this would happen and women would be the ones easily taken in and become enforcers.	I don't want to see the comments space removed as it amounts to censorship. I'd much rather that people saw what other people thought and were able to consider it. Hopefully, readers will recognise when some people are irrational and will not add fuel to the fire. Good moderators would help but they mustn't be trigger happy. They must allow dissent and only remove what it clearly offensive.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?

__label__noRel	By 'standards', maybe certain words should be blocked? Users who continue to post blocked words eventually being banned.	Comments could be checked for hate speech before going live.

__label__noRel	Free speech should trump hate speech because hate speech can also be interpreted as political speech where by dissent of the prevailing political and cultural agendas are not accepted or an attempt is made to use "hate speech" to create a stigma around political agendas that are unpopular.	Limiting the algorithms push to only show negative or controversial viewpoints would go a long way to decreasing the hate comments.
__label__noRel	Newspapers and the media have a big role to play, but so do others	Limit anonymity in public discussions and employ a system of moderation.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?

__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender.

__label__noRel	well said.	Having moderators remove hateful speech and providing better education.
__label__noRel	Reduces free speech	Newspaper websites can eliminate space for readers comments for articles that they think are more likely to receive more hate speech
__label__noRel	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Negative thought. I disagree. any effort will definitely make a difference. If hate speech is not monitored at all, racists and narcissistic people tend to grow and get away with so much	we could use bots the get triggered when certain words are used. The bot will therefore remove the comment andhold it until it has mannually reviewed by a human. Another option can be to allow the users to report comments from other users and if the reports reach a certain threshold then hold that comment for review.
__label__noRel	yes, the lack of consequences is the problem. We can see from somewhere like facebook where peoples info is so easy to find that people have had negative consequences over their hateful posts so clearly being able to link back the comment to the person can help	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	There is a difference between freedom of speech and hate speech. One is neccesary, intellectual and somewhat constructive without being rude. The other is a global problem causing suicide attempts and mental health issues.	All the posts should be checked before being posted and verified by some sort of AI. Hate speech could affect a person's livelihood and mental state
__label__noRel	You may argue that it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police their comment sections. Having said that, perhaps the relevant question you should be asking is whether it is in their best interests to do so. That is, even if it's not their moral obligation, it may STILL be in their financial and functional best interest to do so. The prevalence and salience of hate speech may signal to audiences that the newspaper tolerates (at best) and endorses (at worst) the hateful commentary appearing in their comment section. How do you think this would impact the bottom-line of the bottom line of said newspaper company? I would argue: Not well. And how do you think this would impact the ability of said newspaper to reach future audiences? I would argue: Not well. Individuals disgusted by the appearance of hate speech may be at an increased probability of avoiding said newspaper website in the future on moral grounds. Consider, for example, individuals who boycott Nestle for ethical reasons.	Even though I am generally curious to read other people's comments, I think the best would actually be to eliminate comments altogether, or restrict to the way paper news work, i.e. you can write a letter and they might publish it next time.
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	This is not a black or white topic. The question is how exactly we define hate speech. Criticism in itself is not hate speech, but it is easy to take things to extremes, especially when someone expresses their opinion anonymously. Education about the reasons is important to better understand our own feelings and behaviour. Educate people do not restrict them!
__label__noRel	I can agree with this as Newspapers are not government or public services, they are companies trying to sell newspapers and subscriptions to their services for profit, the comments sections are there to bring more revenue into the company and keep more people logged in and using their websites	https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3394231.3397902
__label__noRel	It isn't perfect but it is a pretty decent %	Freedom of speech can be used as catch-all term to justify the use and propagation of bigoted and hateful language. If we accept that some language is not acceptable due to it's clearly hateful nature then we have to acknowledge that some form of censorship of those particular instances has to occur. I would suggest that eliminating all such spaces from newspaper websites would have a massive detrimental effect on valid, non-bigoted, freedom of speech a cornerstone of western life. We don't ban all cars because some people speed dangerously, we monitor the roads and ban the bad drivers. I suggest that as long as readers comments are monitored continually they should remain.
__label__noRel	I totally agree with this idea, this would still allow for comments on newspaper websites while at the same time addressing the issue of online hate speech.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	But won't people find other ways of creating fake news and hate speech? I mean they can still copy that link and post it on social media giving their opinions	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	i believe commenting should have it's policy, where users have to read the policy before commenting. So if a user uses language that promotes hate speech, the comment should be removed.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	I am reminded while discussing this of the way Daily Mail in UK handles the comments section. It just mentions on top of the comments page that theses comments are not moderated.So it allows everybody to express their opionion. This is how it should be done in my opinion
__label__noRel	It's important not to confuse freedom of speech and hate speech: "freedom" can be a dangerous weapon when you use it to attack others for their identity.	I am unsure if there is a way to reduce hate speech. One persons 'hate speech' is anothers 'freedom of speech'. As a supposedly democratic nation, we need to be able to permit people from all walks of lives and experiences to air their own personal views, whether these are educated views or not.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Perhaps newspapers could use similar tools to respondology (https://respondology.com/ ) or hive moderation (https://hivemoderation.com ) that can identify and block hateful speech. This might well work and I think both of these use AI.
__label__noRel	I agree, because not all comments will be hate speech, some are positive.	hate speech must be clearly defined, it should not be left to the media to decide what is and is not considered hate speech
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	Newspaper comment spaces allow people the opportunity to share their opinions and feel that they can contribute their thoughts and ideas - it can also help readers engage with the content in a different way.
__label__noRel	Removes possibility to have conversations which help move us forward	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	i agree with this comment,	There should be moderation reviewers to delete harmful comments
__label__noRel	okay I hear you but I think that there are situation that do not need people to be rude but they just choose to.	AI could be used to flag hate speech, meaning comments that are hate speech can be flagged at the time. The tech needs more work though based on this article: https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/04/1025742/ai-hate-speech-moderation/
__label__noRel	I disagree with this. I think taking away discussion completely also takes away healthy debate and positive conversation. There are ways to reduce hate comments, such as the ones outlined in this Forbes article: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnrampton/2015/04/09/10-tips-to-dealing-with-trolls/?sh=58ddf0f754f4.	Newspaper websites should use human or artificial intelligence-based moderators who can impartially identify hate speech and remove it from their platforms without removing or censoring genuine, constructive comments and perspectives. If AI is used, certain terms and phrases can be added to a database and comments containing them flagged for moderation to remove hate speech fairly.
__label__noRel	Well then what is your proposition	Research has shown that hate speech can be effectively controled since freedom of speech is not absolute
__label__noRel	By eliminating readers comments, the readers will not be allowed to give their opinion on the topic, which infringes free-speech.	Use technology to monitor and block users
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	Some people will always use hate speech and hide behind their computer, There needs to be some sort of filter added to flag such comments and people and a ban put on the user
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	encourages social participation and reflection	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Education is a great tool but essentially your website gives the solution without the steps. First people need to learn how to disarm the person they're debating with to educate them, which most people don't have the finesse to do. How do you change someones views when they're defensive from start to finish of your conversation?	The best thing would be to have some sort of app that monitors and regulate the language used. in a case where hate speech is found in a comment, the sentence should be blurred out.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	It hink a moderation is required for hate speech. Removing the entire comment section is not an ideal option. However, hate speech is alsoa crime. It is clear that there should be some monitoring in social media in terms of tracking down the user when necessary so similar terms with the real world would be valid. If you make a crime in real word you get you will stand trial so similar option should be valid for social media.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	I think there should be red flagged or blacklisted words that shouldn't be allowed to be used in reader's comments. If a certain post contain such words, it should not be automatically exposed to other readers but should be reviewed first by the admin to check if it meets the standard before being exposed to everyone.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	One mainstream way of mitigating hate speech on online comment sections is to pre-moderate comments. This however may lead to a 'biased' viewpoint. A lighter example of this could be how some youtubers delete constructive criticism.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	By having technology that can detect hate speech so that it can be blocked before it is posted.
__label__noRel	yes indeed we have to check the root cause analysis	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	It may not be elimination, but reduction is better than nothing!	Hate speech should be flagged, hidden and the user should be given a strike. People should be able to still view those comments with a "trigger warning" disclaimer. After 3 strikes the user should be banned from commenting. But they should still be able to view the newspaper so that they don't miss an article that probably would have helped that particular person to change their behavior . More safe and reliable ways of verifying accounts should also be implemented.
__label__noRel	Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but opinions that are built around criticism of ones work do not benefit an ybody	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.

__label__noRel	I agree	I dont think it is a fair choice. For how long should people be silenced. Hate speech is always going to be around. Shutting people up is not going to stop hate speech.
__label__noRel	hate speech can not be given opportunity to thrive and or be heard. it should be removed the moment it is made	We can fairly reduce hate speech from newspapers websites without eliminating space for readers comments by encouraging people to give a reward who will comment without hate speech.
__label__noRel	I also think these should be monitored to a certain degree because hurtful comments can't be out there like they are currently	There will always be a few bad apples in a batch just as there will always be bad people among humanity. Honestly the easiest method of combatting this issue is through the utilization of manual review teams perhaps hired by the newspaper or even paid through revenue made by the articles failing that approach bots can be instantiated with the programmed capability of removing comments that have flagged contents inside them.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used...

__label__noRel	i agree with this as it will be moderated then	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others.

__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	they need to as often it is minorities which are affected
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	I'm a firm believer of freedom of speech therefore eliminating it in any form especially because of something that can be regulated like hate speech, to me is ridiculous.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	by blocking users who violate 'hate speech rules', i feel it should be clearly stated what hate speech is.

I have no real interest in reading readers comments sections in newspapers, but I don't agree that they should be eliminated. The content can be moderated to remove hate speech.

__label__noRel	collapsing the comment section is not the solution because people have freedom of speech however those who make hateful comments can be flagged or banned from using the site	What about allowing the comment section, but having a built-in screener running in the background, that automatically prevents posts with certain hateful words it is built to detect?
__label__noRel	The content is then controlled by the moderators. How do we ensure that a comment they simply disagree with but still adds to the discussion is let through?	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	There are some good points however in having news sites require users to submit data they risk each users' privacy and right to anonymity. This could be increadibly dangerous and would encourage people to stop using the site	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.

__label__noRel	I support the filtering of comments instead of removing the comment section. A filtering systems should be put in place	One user by the name of AndreaP said in order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section Newspapers should be one sided providers. I strongly disagree with this argument. It is very autocratic and happens a lot in countries where media and citizens does not have freedom and oppressed by harsh leadership. Comments in newspapers help many to get raw information from the ground and open minds of many to see issues differently from differing opinions. Indeed comments section are necessary
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Having moderators remove hateful speech and providing better education.

__label__noRel	The establishment elites will never stop the truth, they don't want to be criticised in any way. If truth is banned in online media, people will find another way of discussing truth, like samizdat in Soviet Union	I think that the idea of users submitting personal data before making a comment can have positive and negative effects - positive in the sense that the user may think twice before posting hate speech and that they can be tracked down and educated; negative in the sense that the user could be on a website that wants to use user's personal data for the wrong reasons. I am still of the view that comments with hate speech need to be filtered out because each individual needs to be responsible in their speech.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used...

__label__noRel	People would be more careful with what they say	According to newsy.com, between January and March 2022, Meta took action on more than 15 million pieces of hate speech content on Facebook.

__label__noRel	I think it would be a good idea to ban commenters for some time, they should be issued with the reasons why their post is offensive at the same time	I think that things should be reviewed by a moderator, but it is a tough decision what is considered hate speech and what is someone's opinion.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Discussion can be encouraged, but so often it leads to hate speech / one sided arguments.

__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	While censoring certain words in the context of a comment would help reduce hate speech, an issue that would need to be considered is the use of images used as hate speech. Some "memes" can contain hate speech to the AI may misinterpret this as a regular image while the image could be posted as hate speech. An example of this is when people on Reddit use images as "memes" containing racism and sometimes the bot does not flag it as racism. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	The best way to reduce hate speech would be to make sure that moderators are present to check on comments, it would not be advisable to cancel comments completely due the feedback it gives and people will always have their opinions and sometimes they will involve hate speech, which is unavoidable...
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	I think that keeping a comment section is overall good as it keeps engagement but needs to be heavily moderated and regulated so it doesn't just dissolve into a lot of hate speech and grounds for radicalisation
__label__noRel	ensures a safe and protected readers environment	I believe removing the comment section is not a solution and that it actually encourages hate speech
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	Readers should be able to comment but be informed of certain comments that would be considered hate speech. If they are aware and still choose to comment hateful words, the newspaper website should feel comfortable enough to remove those comments since the reader was informed that comments like those would not be acceptable.
__label__noRel	This would work well with non-bias moderators	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	i agree that we still need readers comments but they should be filtered.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	In my opinion the comment section should not be removed. I personally get very annoyed if I watch or read something and want to express my opinion, then go down to the comment section to sadly find out the comments are turned off. This limits the freedom of speech and blocks the ability for the people to vent out somehow. I think this builds aggression and causes problems afterwards. The better thing to do is to limit bad speech, foul words and cursing but removing the comments completely is not a good idea.
__label__noRel	Moderators need to act quickly to remove any hate speech	we should keep comment sections on newspaper websites but we should have moderators to filter out any hate speech
__label__noRel	hate speech is a real problem and enabling it to freely exist on the internet can lead to a variety of issues including mental health problems for the person its directed at.	If eliminating readers comments is out of the question, then it must be that hate speech is recognized and removed before a comment is even published. People use the free speech argument but free speech isn't 100% guaranteed in cases of speech causing harm (e.g. Yelling fire in a crowded theatre). Hate speech causes harm.

This article below focuses on the negative views of the comment section. I like the quote from Dr Philips, as she explains that more discussion is required, not less, and thus an onsite intervention is required to deal with hate speech as opposed to the removal of the comment section. https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation

__label__noRel	I agree	as long as good moderators are in place, hate speech and disrespectful comments will be weeded out.
__label__noRel	I disagree, people that use hate speech are fully aware, especially if it is related to a newspaper article.	people must change, not internet/website
__label__noRel	I think that is a very good idea	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	If a newspaper does not do anything, it might facilitate hate speech and help it reach to millions of people by simply hosting it on their website. Therefore there is a responsibility.	As already demonstrated by other bigger social media companies, algorithms often contain and reinforce the negative biases of its creators, so I'm not sure how effective they would be in detecting and filtering out hate speech.
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	The vast majority of digital news consumers - that is 76% in America, read comments sections. This means by removing them were missing a big chance at limiting the harmful effects of echo chambers and encouraging consumers to think critically and question things
__label__noRel	some ideas are extreme and inconsiderate	In order to reduce hate speech in the comments section, newspapers need to employ moderators on their platforms so that there can be someone watching and removing all types of hate speech in the comments section.
__label__noRel	This is correct, as blocking free speech altogether leads us into a very different type of society. It is a tricky dilemma, how to allow free speech but prevent hate speech, but one that does need attention and ideas	there must be a way to build in logarithms to find certain words or phrases
__label__noRel	Modern life has moved on from my world view in this regard; I probably shouldn't be taken as any kind of sensible benchmark.	By currating comments individualy in person upon reporting. Auto block certain words e.g N word
__label__noRel	no you cant control peoples behaviours but what you also cant control is peoples abilities to have an opinion. we all need to have a say, hence what twitter is full off .	Regulations of comment sections has been proven with various other platforms to be the best solution. When there are clear rules put in place regarding what should be considered as hate speech and the consequences of the part taking in such could lead to eg. A ban from the being able to comment for a certain period of time.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	I think hate speech is always going to be a problem unfortunately, and although websites can monitor comments and remove any hate speech what ultimately is needed is teaching people there are better ways to get their opinions across and better use of freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Celebrities are a massive victim of hate speech allowing people the freedom of commenting what they want is harmful.

__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	The newspapers should encourage the victims of hate speech to report hate speech published, establish monitoring and evaluation units in newsrooms. Some units should be tasked with monitoring hate speech trends, compiling reports and bringing these to the attention of key institutions
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__noRel	Name and shame those that want to spout hate, I agree.	I believe the comment section should be open to all to express their opinions.We need freedom of speech. Hate speech can be ignored. But it is important to show the view of all.
__label__noRel	Having a timed ban is a good way to discourage hate speech, teaching people to reconsider their language and helping to moderate the tone of the comment section without permanently banning people from the discussion.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Not to be rude, but I doubt people who post hateful comments would care. Imagine someone telling a bully that they're rude - I don't think this would change anything in their behaviour.	Totally agree . Users all human beings after all
__label__noRel	freedom of speech	I think that the idea of users submitting personal data before making a comment can have positive and negative effects - positive in the sense that the user may think twice before posting hate speech and that they can be tracked down and educated; negative in the sense that the user could be on a website that wants to use user's personal data for the wrong reasons. I am still of the view that comments with hate speech need to be filtered out because each individual needs to be responsible in their speech.
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.

We need to block the users that use hate speech and filter the comments that have any form of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I feel that people should be protected	Rarely some very sensitive articles should be allowed to switch off comments sector.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	human rights of the masses should not be violated regardless of their beliefs and views
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	I think we should just collect personal information. It works in South Korea. People will behave if their are not anonymous. Modertors are important too, but not enough,
__label__noRel	Free speech	By the whole nature of the newspapers removing this ability, who is to say the newspaper itself could be potentially spreading hate news?
__label__noRel	covering both sides is great but we should be able to be respectful towards eachother	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated.

__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	I disagree. Comments might be useful for users and also the owners of the newspapers. Though, asking people to identify themselves when registering could help reduce hate speech, as people would not be able to do whatever they want anonymously.
__label__noRel	Surely these platforms could just end up filled with people who don't care about formulating a justified argument and post fake news instead. How do you monitor who is allowed to comment?	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	I agree. Users should be able to to flag harmful comments and report them to a moderator. Users can also counteract damaging comments by refuting the content of the comment, for example, by refering to reliable sources	In the digital world we live in - unfortunately hate speech is part and parcel of the benefits of having such an open forum and allowing everyone to have a voice. Hate speech is made by a minuscule minority of people. Perhaps have a 'report hate speech' button that members of the community can use.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	Have moderators who constantly monitor and remove hateful posts or ones that are inciting others/goading others.
__label__noRel	I agree with your opinion. I think trying to find ways to moderate the comments (either automatically or by a team of humans) would be a good step. Then it's also up to the responsability of the users themselves to have a good attitude.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	Newspaper websites should use human or artificial intelligence-based moderators who can impartially identify hate speech and remove it from their platforms without removing or censoring genuine, constructive comments and perspectives. If AI is used, certain terms and phrases can be added to a database and comments containing them flagged for moderation to remove hate speech fairly.
__label__noRel	I agree. Especially people who work in that area of expertise and can give valuable inputs	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	Yes, they can deeply hurt anyone's internal peace	Allow for a voting system on the comments, so as the cream rises to the top and the dredges sink away.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	I'm of the supporting view that the use of AI to filter out Hate speech could prove to be very useful
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	I agree to a certain extent - like Wikipedia, if anyone can contribute then there is no way to validate what's been said, and it can create "Fake News".	By having an algorithm that detects and deletes any hate speech comment.
__label__noRel	I agree	We need to create a society where we can debate with each other respectfully, we can know which platforms to use and not rile each other up without offending. It is widely suggested that education can address the extent of hate speech: https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/addressing-hate-speech-through-education-global-education-ministers-conference. However, this needs to go hand in hand with moderation of sites to ensure people are kept within reason. It is not a case of any one single solution.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	I agree with both of these ideas. Having a moderation means consistency, but having other readers flag comments allows other commenters to hold peers to account and ensure that the comment section is an inclusive and fair section.	Just don't write about it
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	Limit anonymity in public discussions and employ a system of moderation.
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	I think we need to develop a way to recognize hate speech in comments so that it is easy to monitor comment sections for derogatory and offensive language. There are studies on how to go about this for example if you follow this link it talks about "A Feature-Based Approach to Assess Hate Speech in User Comments" https://www.cairn.info/revue-questions-de-communication-2020-2-page-529.htm
__label__noRel	Hate speech undermines people	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.

Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	Completely removing the comment section is out of the question. How else is the audience supposed to interact with the material and each other? the feedback could be useful to the writer too for future articles pertaining to similar topics.
__label__noRel	https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/combat-online-hate-speech/#	This should be done with a mix of moderation, community flagging and reporting before moving to disabling comments, based ona mix of moderative judgement and amount of flagging
__label__noRel	I think this solution can be very intrusive. Especially in a times where our personal data is being collected as a commodity.	Someone should monitor the comments in the website such as administrator or moderator. Or comments need to review first by administrator before it can be posted on the website
__label__noRel	That's a good speech! Unfortunately, in the real world, that doesn't work. For the most part, people that comments on newspapers websites are adults (or late teens) and already got an education. And yes, for the most part, it'll be enough, they have good values and know how to share ideas without hate. But for some, it's not the case...	It's a balance. There should be the ability to pre- and post-moderate comments. Pre- using technology to recognise potentially offensive words as well as closer moderation of articles on potentially controversial topics. Post-moderation to allow readers to report offensive topics which will be hidden from view until moderated.
__label__noRel	i agree with the comment about fake news, a lot of people reading online articles are vulnerable to taking information at face value without checking whether or not there is actual evidence for this	There are other ways to reduce or block hateful comments without having to eliminate comment section.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	i think one can filter the comment so that only the comment that show love are seen by people
__label__noRel	It's a good idea, but too many get giddy at trying to break rules and in doing so, ruin things.	I agree that the only way to ensure balanced discussion without allowing hate or eliminating genuine responses is through moderation of comments before posting
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	Reduce hate speech by screening out certain words. If a comment contains such words, it is deleted or hidden from public view
__label__noRel	I agree that some regulation and introduction of the standards of communication is necessary to allow for maintaining comment space open for everybody.	More emphasis on moderation of specific language would reduce the risk of hate speech. Also, moderators approving comments before they appear on the website would help.
__label__noRel	Thats a reasonable idea however, there needs to updates that automatically flag out inappropriate comments	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also

__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	I think that fully blocking comments being allowed is detrimental to free speech, therefore comments should be allowed. However, there should be monitoring and banning of certain individuals if they are found to be continually hateful towards others.
__label__noRel	Allowing the readers to push a post out of air by flagging it could be just as easily abused by people to mass flag posts they dont like for political or personal reasons and create more problems than it solves	More emphasis on moderation of specific language would reduce the risk of hate speech. Also, moderators approving comments before they appear on the website would help.

__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	I agree with most of the commenters here, there needs to be moderation. Even if you don't agree with the arguments there are ways of saying it that do not fall into 'hate speech'.
__label__noRel	the writer will not feel disheartened	the comment section is for sharing information and opinions without the need of hate speech. those who promote and share hate speech should get banned from the comment section
__label__noRel	I agree, public debate is good.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	I think using a platform which blocks out certain words, kind of like a filter would help. So if someone made a post with a certain word in, that post would not be made public, instead the comment would be flagged and go to a admin, who can read the comment and then decide if the 'bot' which flagged it was correct or not, and then deciding if to allow the post to be made or not
__label__noRel	This would reduce hate speech and overall help to ensure a promote positive environment	This article describes how censoring might lead users to leave platforms and join other platforms with lighter censoring rules https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/global-extremes/does-censoring-radical-right-social-media-work/

Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	In my opinion the comment section should not be removed. I personally get very annoyed if I watch or read something and want to express my opinion, then go down to the comment section to sadly find out the comments are turned off. This limits the freedom of speech and blocks the ability for the people to vent out somehow. I think this builds aggression and causes problems afterwards. The better thing to do is to limit bad speech, foul words and cursing but removing the comments completely is not a good idea.

__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	Newspapers and free speech functioned well for a couple of hundred years without instant comments. People used to write letters to the newspaper, including their name. The newspaper would then publish some letters anonymously. This meant that people were protected but offered well considered opinions, rather than abusive or nasty comments. Perhaps a slower postal system encourages better behaviour rather than an amplified Twitter-esque school-yard of bullying and abuse.
__label__noRel	Would that be enough?	I think there should be moderators on articles that make the comments. less visible so offensive comments can have a warning before viewing
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	Hate speech should be flagged, hidden and the user should be given a strike. People should be able to still view those comments with a "trigger warning" disclaimer. After 3 strikes the user should be banned from commenting. But they should still be able to view the newspaper so that they don't miss an article that probably would have helped that particular person to change their behavior . More safe and reliable ways of verifying accounts should also be implemented.

__label__noRel	I like the idea of allowing readers to flag comments deemed as inappropriate, perhaps with a limit of how many they can do, otherwise I can see some taking advantage of this feature and flagging every comment they disagree with.	I think that a comment section is necessary for engagement and exchange of ideas but having said that, there should be a code for AI embedded within that platform which will be able to detect hate speech or words classified as hate speech then the AI can delete them automatically. Also people can report the comment and the AI should delete the comment within minutes of it being reported.

If we use AI, we can simply add new filters, like words or phrases, AI will filter all comments in the way we "teach" it.	Have monitoring software be used. The comment section should not be removed, because it then deprives the general public of their opinion and freedom of speech as well as addressing any inaccuracies that were mentioned in articles.

It is easy to be hateful online when you are anonymous.

__label__noRel	Completely agree with this! Both by human moderator and maybe AI to help identifying and flagging posts that could contain hate speech based on keywords.	pro
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it.

__label__noRel	I totally agree with this idea, this would still allow for comments on newspaper websites while at the same time addressing the issue of online hate speech.	Freedpn of speech doesnt mean you must promote hate speech on newspapers, it basically means you free to voice out your concerns in around society in a more respectfull manner.

__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	Yes I'm sure there is software that can do that.	we can do that by having strict rules on language and hate speech where one can be blocked from commenting or their comments gets removed if there is any negativity
__label__noRel	I think it is the responsibility of the websites to moderate any hatefull comments. You can agree and disagree with somthing without hate.	by blocking users who violate 'hate speech rules', i feel it should be clearly stated what hate speech is.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	Hate speech is something people intentionally and so if people continue to participate in it, they should be punished.
__label__noRel	I would agree, but this article (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0163443712472089?casa_token=FJm_UB0wIqEAAAAA%3ALr9dI-lrHJemMa9XgBVkx8tCkSQUSUAg14owxExDkpThv0tpIu6LJySR_p7EJ_lPqQbiATTxEfULs7k) states that filtering racism doesn't really stop racism, it just encourages it to go elsewhere. Maybe it will protect sites that use it, but otherwise, people will still find racism online. And maybe that's not the responsibility of the news site, but I find it disheartening still.	Maybe filter through comments
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	Maybe AI could filter hate speech

This way readers could share different opinions and thoughts abut the topic at hand without offending one another.
__label__noRel	This would reduce hate speech and overall help to ensure a promote positive environment	i believe commenting should have it's policy, where users have to read the policy before commenting. So if a user uses language that promotes hate speech, the comment should be removed.

__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	I know this has been discussed a few times potentially in reply to comments but I'd like to repeat it again: language is complex and you can't simply ban or flag certain terms or phrases and think you catch all the hate speech comments etc. While a report button and the use of a software that can support a human moderator is in essence a good idea, it might also delete comments that do not actually contain HS or completely miss others overall. I think this decision by the newspaper turned into an entire discussion of manageability of monitoring discussion sections and away from the ethical considerations.
__label__noRel	Everyone has an opinion, and I agree that no one should be silenced. However I do not believe that the comment section of a newspaper article is where people should have the freedom to write hate	Education in media ethics: The first step in combating tribalized hate speech is realizing that, while the right to free expression is a fundamental human right, the rise of social media has produced a number of different channels for its creation, packaging, and transmission. The rights and liberties of journalists and their role in fostering and developing peaceful societies should be emphasized in media ethics education. The political, social, and cultural rights of individuals and groups, including the freedom of expression, must be made more widely known, as well as the obligations and societal repercussions that come with press freedom. Journalists need to have the knowledge and abilities to spot hate speech and disseminate anti-hate messaging.
__label__noRel	I agree that most if not all online news articles do not need a comments section.

__label__noRel	I agree in maybe censoring certain words but having moderators doesn't site well with me at all - it's getting to the point where only woke views are allowed to be expressed.	I am reminded while discussing this of the way Daily Mail in UK handles the comments section.

__label__noRel	I agree most with this post, there's no reason to allow hate speech to exist on social platforms when it's so easy to moderate and control	There could be a segment in the website that gives informed context to a subject to prevent uninformed comments and furthermore the newspaper should monitor the comments and censor any hate speech comments.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	I agree	I don't think it's fair to eliminate comments from newspaper articles because the public is entitled to have their opinions heard. The best way to deal with hate speech is to moderate each comment before it is posted. Also the newspaper could ban accounts who engage in hate speech in the comments section. This moderation could be done through both human moderators and software to find trigger words signifying hate speech. It's important to democracy that citizens can have their say on the issues that affect their lives.
__label__noRel	I disagree with this because newspapers can lose readers due to poor interaction	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	true, but maybe they can remove anonymity so that everyone can be accountable for what they say.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree with this. The trick is how to select unbiased moderators. They have to go by a guideline	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	If required, details can be handed to the authorities if there is a legal breach.	I think it is ok to remove the comments. There are other places people can go to express opinions.
__label__noRel	i definately agree newspaper require multiple moderator who check every story before it gets published to the public	There should be some level of censoring to eliminate hate speech, but not to the extent where comments are totally disabled
__label__noRel	Absolutely, hate speech forms thoughts, which forms character which leads to violent actions with enough time. It's a very serious issue that causes real world harm to marginalized communities when left unchecked.	Debate should be available upon all topics. To reduce this availability reduces the opportunities for people to express their opinions and undermines democratic processes. Hate speech should be managed and eliminated before publication.

__label__noRel	How can the classing system be done, through examples?	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	This is unlikely to be feasible. United states courts have repeatedly upheld a right to anonymity in this context: https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/why-ending-anonymity-would-not-make-social-media-better.php	Stop calling it hate speech maybe it is just another opinion

One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	True, but not every criticism is valid	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	other points of view should always be welcomed	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	The newspapers aren't reading consumer input though. The only people reading the comments section are other consumers. The only purpose they serve is announcing your views to everyone else reading the same article. It's unnecessary and people's opinions are rarely changed by what they read in the comments section from some random reader/commenter.	Discussion can be encouraged, but so often it leads to hate speech / one sided arguments. There needs to be a moderator in place to delete / hide certain comments, so free speech is allowed, but hate speech is not.
__label__noRel	less ideas generated	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	i think minimum news coverage should be given to hate speech and it shouuld be very stictley monitered as well
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	I agree	by not allowing certain words to be used in the comments space
__label__noRel	Punishments would be good but also a mixture of education and this could help. Hate speech is a very person-by-person thing, what some may think isn't, some may think is.	We can reduce hate speech by holding the owner of the platform accountable for hate speech being on their platform, this will force the platform owners to put strict systems in place to ensure this does not occur.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	By educating people that not everything written in newspapers is true, they should egnore some information

__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	I think it is important for people to be able to comment on newspapers websites, but I think there needs to be a way of moderating the comments section to prevent/remove hate speech.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way.

__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	There is a careful balance to be made between protecting others from the effects of hate speech and protecting free speech. Online hate speech unfortunately can have the effect of increasing violence against minorities (https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons) but blocking all free speech because of the actions of a few seems like a poor decision. More must be done to remove hate speech online quickly and this means spending more money tackling it.
__label__noRel	It is nice to think we could reduce hate speech.	Limit anonymity in public discussions and employ a system of moderation.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	Using moderators, educating users, calling out trolls and haters!
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	moderating the comments
__label__noRel	True, but not every criticism is valid	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	I believe the comment section should be open to all to express their opinions.We need freedom of speech. Hate speech can be ignored. But it is important to show the view of all.
__label__noRel	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comments_section	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?

I was completely taken aback by some strong stances to remove the comment space, and the belief in that because Newspapers should be one-sided providers. I would disagree because newspaper share societal information and society should be allowed to engage and be part of the conversation instead of just consuming whatever information is being released for consumption. It has been seen as a result of other newspaper websites removing the comment section that it reduces the trust of the reader because they are aware of the bias of the information they are consuming, and also it reduces the amount of time readers spend on these sites because there is no community engagements. Source: https://www.techdirt.com/2021/11/08/killing-website-comment-sections-wasnt-brilliant-move-many-newsroom-leaders-assumed/
__label__noRel	Yes, I agree 100% with this as the impacts of hate speech and cyberbullying can be detrimental to the person. https://www.youthranch.org/blog/social-media-dangers-and-the-effects-of-cyberbullying	The best solution would be one that elegantly ties the reduction of hate speech in the comment section with no detrimental effect to the publics freedom of speech. This could be done by setting guidelines for hate speech, and also ensuring that the public provides identifying information such as their email address and especially their phone number. Both can be tracked to the person. To take it even further would be to be able to collect data such as ip addresses( with the commenters permission of course) when the person sends their comment so as to be able hold them accountable for any hate speech they send in. This will prevent people from using such language and hoping to hide under anonymity.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	This is very true and I think that by focusing on educating others before they decide to give an opinion as most hate speech is just a form of ignorance from others.	Commenters should agree to abide by all rules when signing up to the website and he banned for breaking the rules. Also all submitted comments must be thoroughly checked for negative for flagged words or topics. Also I think it would reduce the chances of this happening if users could not reply to each other or comment on others opinions. It's about each users initial opinion on a certain subject and less about judging others opinions on what they think!!!!
__label__noRel	I agree that hate speech should not be tolerated, but I don't think that it requires the total removal of space for comments, as the comments add value. I believe that moderation is the way forward.	I also believe that a filter or having a group of moderators constantly filtering out the negative - hate speech would be beneficial. Similar to other social media platforms, users of the platform perhaps should be allowed to flag or report comments that aren't appropriate,and then a moderator should check the report and take the steps necessary to make the platform a safe space.
__label__noRel	I think appointing moderators for this task is quite costly and it will be based on the subjective opinion of the moderator. Interference will prevent freedom of speech and will be a bit biased.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	I also agree with this position. letting people fully express themselves will fully enable sourcing The root of the problem	The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is often used as a reason not to have readers comments. It seems that this is not a fair argument for eliminating readers comments because of the psychological phenomenon of "cognitive dissonance" - we automatically search for echo chambers in any context.
__label__noRel	I agree - but how do we do it whilst giving readers some protection?	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	definately comments section should be monitored before it gets out to the public	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	Slow process. Subject to flaws if misinterpreted by moderators/other commenters.	I think that moderation is the most effective way of preventing hate speech. Filtering comments would not work as it is difficult to find a algorithm for the context of a comment. Free speech is so important it should not be removed.
__label__noRel	However, it might also discourage people from leaving comments generally as it is quite difficult to leave a response and not many people would go through that much effort to say something, which there is a risk of being personally identified as well.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	If everyone is honest about what they saw.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Removing any form of comments or place for discussion may reduce hate speech, but also prevents discussion, leading to one sided arguments	the fairly way of reducing hate speech from newspapers website is not allowing anyone to comment that is to bloc the comment section.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.

__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	Although it might be unfair for others, I think majority can agree that removing the comment section will be helpful because then it means anyone that has an opinion can rather call the newspaper.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	Nowadays with the amount of social media platforms that are available newspapers don't hold as much power.

While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	Allow others users to rate the comments and block those who receive bad ratings
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	I see that most people have the same idea as I have of having moderated. I did not think about what the guidelines could be and how censoring could be a contributing factor to my stand on having comments moderated, but it still seems like the best solution.
__label__noRel	Hate speech is already defined in law in many countries. As its already a criminal offence , the existing legislation provides the definition of hate speech, and blueprint to follow.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship.

There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	Companies aswell as the users should be liable and held accountable for allowing a platform to be used to share hate speech
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.

__label__noRel	Reduces hate speech	The comment section needs to be moderated using some kind of filter to automatically filter any words on the banned list and then use a report system to flag up anything which tries to bypass this. This will allow a human moderator to quickly decide what can be kept and what needs action.
__label__noRel	I disagree. In an Institute for Government webinar yesterday (24/10 https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/events/what-works-government-evidence-policy) the point was made that the public are not educated to challenge what they read in the media. It is therefore naive to assume that people would start to search around things they read in the news because 1) we are not taught how to do this and 2) there is no motive for people to begin to do this. Based on the amount of conspiracy documentaries on Netflix and YouTube it is possible that people would indeed search around what they read but for negative/conspiracy motives rather than as ground truthing.	I agree with your ideas. I think it still gives people a voice but without going too far
__label__noRel	This is correct, as blocking free speech altogether leads us into a very different type of society. It is a tricky dilemma, how to allow free speech but prevent hate speech, but one that does need attention and ideas	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I totally agree with you	I am unsure if there is a way to reduce hate speech. One persons 'hate speech' is anothers 'freedom of speech'. As a supposedly democratic nation, we need to be able to permit people from all walks of lives and experiences to air their own personal views, whether these are educated views or not.
__label__noRel	That said, I'd agree that everyone should be able to express their opinions.....as long as they are public and the accounts are transparent, without the users hiding behind anonymous accounts. If they do that, then consequences can occur.	Maybe if the comments were better moderated then this would reduce the amount of hate speech.
__label__noRel	Allowing those to post it anonymously gives them the okay to do it over and over again without being called out over it.	I think that someone should be assigned as a moderator who assesses comments before they are posted to ensure they don't contain any offensive information
__label__noRel	Awareness campaigns would not suffice. Real methods could be implemented to reduce (white supremacist) hate speech: "White supremacist speech is readily detectable, Hemphill says, detailing the ways it is distinguishable from commonplace speech in social media, including: Frequently referencing racial and ethnic groups using plural noun forms (whites, etc.) Appending “white” to otherwise unmarked terms (e.g., power) Using less profanity than is common in social media to elude detection based on “offensive” language Being congruent on both extremist and mainstream platforms Keeping complaints and messaging consistent from year to year" https://news.umich.edu/hate-speech-in-social-media-how-platforms-can-do-better/	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I totally agree with you. Adding that the comment section must remain closed until the education of the people takes effect. Remembering that the learning process takes time to complete.	The comment section needs to be moderated using some kind of filter to automatically filter any words on the banned list and then use a report system to flag up anything which tries to bypass this. This will allow a human moderator to quickly decide what can be kept and what needs action.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	It may be a good idea to involve some form of moderators to check if there are any hate speeches. Aggressive comments may be censored accordingly. However, we need to be careful in doing this as some may have negative effect as silencing voices.
__label__noRel	Tracking details could become intrusive.	Hate-speech is part of free-speech, it's hard to focus on one without affecting the other so what should be done is to write articles differently, a neutral way where both sides can see themselves because we become less aggressive when we feel part of a group
__label__noRel	Not necessarily. I think opinions are okay but not when it is hate and discrimination. Thinking morally that is wrong and shouldn't be allowed on any type of platform.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	Educate people about it
__label__noRel	Arguably it could be in the newspaper's self-interest to police hate speech even if we say that it's not necessarily their responsibility, as moderation of comment sections has been shown to reduce perceptions of bias of the article itse lf (see e.g. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369118X.2017.1356861)	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__noRel	I think it is important for newspapers to provide a platform for people to express and discuss their opinions. Being able to hear other peoples' opinions is an important part of educating oneself, so completely eliminating a comment section seems unprogressive.	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I agree	I believe the fairest way is the hardest way and that's to have a small group of people moderating REAL hate speech and spam. If someone wants to just use a racist term or promote their website, then these people's comment should be removed and they should be banned from commenting for a period of time. The idea to remove comments entirely is absurd as the news is not trustworthy enough to be the sole voice people hear. We need to hear other voices.
__label__noRel	Using moderators and flagging can be abused to prevent valid comments. If the moderator doesn't like what you have written, or if there are several users who doesn't like you on the platform, they can abuse the flagging. Just look at YouTube and how many abuse the flagging to get rid of a channel or person who they don't agree with and who have strong opinions you don't agree with.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	I agree with removing comments but not for this reason	I don't believe removing the comment section will help remove hate speech, but having a system that can track the device and the people that use that device can go a long way in removing trolls from a community platform and prevent them from becoming repeat offenders.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	I think by holding the people that use hateful speech accountable i.e., blocking them from accessing newspaper websites
__label__noRel	People will always find other alternative ways to express express themselves. Removing the comments section is not the solution but it would help reduce cyber bullying and make the internet a safer space for people.	i am against the removal of the comment section and i believe that regulations and clear rules are the way to go, have systems put into place and enforce the rules. let there be punishable offences for rule breakers.

__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Despite my defence of human moderators, it seems they too are flawed -- check out this article https://www.technologynetworks.com/informatics/news/ai-trusted-as-much-as-humans-to-flag-hate-speech-365777 -- human moderators are not only prone to bias but also impractical. With the huge wealth of content posted every second online, it is unrealistic to expect humans to be able to view, criticise, and moderate every single comment.
__label__noRel	But there is a major difference between " white people should die" and "I have a dislike towards the white race are statistically more	Moderating comments could be a viable solution. The use of AI could make it easier given that there could be thousands and thousands of comments, too much for human moderator/s to keep track of.
__label__noRel	Agreed - it's technically simple to ensure that any website that allows public comments, can be linked to verified accounts. The government were thinking about doing this with adult sites - why not with sites that revel in hate speech.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	I agree with this, this tools can be helpful in reducing hate speech	It goes further than this. We live in a society that has a lot of cry babies. We need to be impervious to negative comments from strangers on a social platform and that is anonymous. Most people need to grow a pair, develop a spine or stop being cry babies. Once this is achieved you will see that any contribution you make to a discussion will be debated in a civilized manner.
__label__noRel	I do agree that comments shouldn't be closed.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	have word filters
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	I'm a firm believer of freedom of speech therefore eliminating it in any form especially because of something that can be regulated like hate speech, to me is ridiculous.
__label__noRel	I agree, cancelling opinions is reducing free speech, but there needs to be a bar to which all comments are moderated and allowed/prohibited.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Exactly, regulation is necessary, either by a software or an actual person	I think removing space for comments is not the solution because how else will people discuss the matter at hand or share their opinion. I think hate speech should be set to be hidden from being viewed instread.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	If people aren’t made aware of issues relating to hate speech, there may not be enough awareness to create a change	report comment buttons could be useful but there should be monitors that check comments before they are allowed to be posted
__label__noRel	Human moderators can make good measured contributions and decisions about whether content is ok or not. Ultimately its the newspaper that decides what content it hosts on its website.	I don't believe removing the comment section will help remove hate speech, but having a system that can track the device and the people that use that device can go a long way in removing trolls from a community platform and prevent them from becoming repeat offenders.
__label__noRel	I agree but what is to be done about those who use hate speech? Do we just let them be? And what about the newspaper's reputation? Should they be known as a newspaper that allows people to comment on whatever they like with no repercussions?	have an AI to scan and analyse trigger words, then the alert is passed to a human reviewer then can say whether or not it's hate speech
__label__noRel	yes this is the best way to reduce hate speech while still allowing readers to comment their opinion	the best way is for companies to filter hate speech and remove it as long as the criteria for hate speech comes from an independent organisation. If companies themselves govern what is hate speech then we would become subject to there rules which you would lose the point of freedom of speech. Also there should be more support in the community for people who are being targeted in hate speech attacks.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	Completely removing the comment section is out of the question. How else is the audience supposed to interact with the material and each other? the feedback could be useful to the writer too for future articles pertaining to similar topics.
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	to reduce hate speech it is important to raise the stakes of what happens if you are caught. scientific evidence and criminological theory shows that if someone perceives greater risk in their actions, they are more likely to desist.
__label__noRel	People with genuine hateful intentions will not change because of this.	Thank you for this!, this is a great idea
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	ALthough the idea of free speech is important, it cannot be used as an excuse to upset others and use racist/sexist/ violent language.
__label__noRel	Yes, another way to only limit hate speech is to remove anonymity. Therefore, certain sites can require those to sign-up with their bio and this is verified by moderators. Someone may think twice about being 'hateful' if there are repercussions.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	This is right.

I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	History and recent events have shown that there should be limits to free speech	I think that readers who use hate speech should be reported and temporarily banned from the site, as I believe that we need comments section in online newspaper articles. It is important to share your views as we have freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	A similar tool is being used for music, to identify if it's DMCA free or not, if the music is commercial they ban your account online. Same thing should happen with hate speech. Scan the online media for bad words, specifics and then remove the comments all together.	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I agree with that. We shouldn't incentive hate speech.	everyone should be entitled to comment and have opinions but the comment section should be checked and hate comments deleted and that user blocked on the website
__label__noRel	I agree there must be standards. Good point made there.	the website should have terms and conditions on the words that can be used and warnings if failure to follow the recommended words .
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	I don't think we can police websites 100% but if comments are moderated I think we can reach quite a high degree of compliance
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	As much people have freedom of speech we are also obliged to respect other people whilst doing so.	to reduce hate speech it is important to raise the stakes of what happens if you are caught. scientific evidence and criminological theory shows that if someone perceives greater risk in their actions, they are more likely to desist.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Having read all of the previous discussion surrounding this debate, I still stand by my original opinion. Moderating comments by an official representative of the newspaper doesn't allow for free speech. We do however, need to eliminate hate speech. I think the best way to do this is to put this in the hands of the community and other readers.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	Like I mentioned previously,the need for artificial intelligence is vital and like what AliceW mentioned in hjer post that people needs to be educated about hate speech which I strongly support.I also think it is everyone's responsibility to educate each other the damage hate speech has to individuals and the society at large
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.

__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	we can do that by having strict rules on language and hate speech where one can be blocked from commenting or their comments gets removed if there is any negativity
__label__noRel	Removing the comments section won't make much difference as people just migrate to different platforms to continue posting hate speech, the EU setup a code of conduct for countering illegal hate speech, https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/combatting-discrimination/racism-and-xenophobia/eu-code-conduct-countering-illegal-hate-speech-online_en, this has had an effect on hate speech online and is something that newspapers can be part of if they want to help stop hate speech being posted by users responding to online articles.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	I agree	I think that keeping an open space for discussion is vital and needed. Strick and easy to understand rules should be there and a group of moderators implementing them as well. We should do more about educating on media ethics, keeping freedom of expression should be combined with counteracting hate speech messages.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	as long as good moderators are in place, hate speech and disrespectful comments will be weeded out.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	agreed	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	I don't think the intention is to be aggressive but sometimes expressing yourself may lead to saying things that hurt other people.	A system should be developed to detect certain words that are considered as hate speech. This will help prevent or eliminate hate speech comments
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	people feel powerful behind an anonymous account, its easier to say things you would never normally say under the guise of anonymity, if it was easier to link a comment to who it came from and if people actually faced consequences from posting hate then this could help stop it.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	Be more strict when allowing people to create profiles, that require identification before allowing anybody to comment. Stopping people being anonymous enough to feel confident while posting hate speech I think will be more beneficial than restricting peoples comments.

__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons	I also think the concept of Counterspeech to reduce the impact of hate speech could be beneficial.https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/counterspeech-better-way-tackling-online-hate
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	The difficulty with moderation is that it is subjective - if done so via human moderation if there is no existing framework to follow particular viewpoints or comments may not be seen to be worthy of removing though for others this may not be the case. If moderating is done so by filtering words or with no human intervention, over-moderation is a risk. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2056305119832588
__label__noRel	https://time.com/5739688/facebook-hate-speech-languages/	A combination of a warning system, detailing what might be considered hate speech and a manual review if potential hate speech is detected as well as on manual reports (allowing brief descriptions for reasons for reporting) seems like a good way to go about it. People who have a history of posting more than one hate comment on the platform should be moderated each time before their comment gets publicised whether it's detected as hate speech by the algorithm or not. They would lose the privilege of being able to comment instantly without review.
__label__noRel	With every right comes responsibly so your right cannot impose on others	There is no cure for hate speech, but there is a way to stand up against it. Speak out against hate speech - fight racism and bigotry with love, empathy, compassion, and strength. We may not be able to eliminate hatred entirely, but the more steps we can take to educate and support human beings, and speak out against injustice, the better this world will become. Resources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech
__label__noRel	Whilst this isn't a terrible idea for this issue if everyone in comments sections is discoverable this could be very dangerous and turn what is a purely online hate problem into a real hate problem. Many people online have talked about issues with stalkers and being doxxed and this could make the problem a lot worse.	State that the editor is free to print or not print any comments, and his/hers is the final decision.
__label__noRel	but the amount of comments is what puts too much of a strain on moderators	Just don't write about it
__label__noRel	This can hinder the increase of hate speech by filtering out the hate words	I believe some sort of regulation in media will always be necessary to decrease the damage hate speech might cause -- comments space included. We still need to get to the bottom of the issue, though.
__label__noRel	I agree, any news that is shaared on a website will have the possibility to be shared on twittter and the hate speech could continue there	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Newspaper websites should invest more in technology that can be used to detect hate speech and not allow it to be posted. They should only allow comments posted in the language that the software will understand so that it is able to eliminate hate speech without difficulties. they should also be willing to punish people who post hate speech by reporting them to the authorities.
__label__noRel	Gathering data in a specific area of online discussion like newspaper comment sections would probably reveal a lot about how online discourse turns to hate speech and how to tackle it as a problem. Maybe this task could be given to an independent or charitable institution, with the newspapers' cooperation?	First, it would be important to define what hate speech is so that readers that want to post comments have a chance to self-modify their posts. Secondly, having a filter that will automatically block posts that contain proscribed words could also help to reduce the amount of hate speech featured in comments sections.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	there must be a way to build in logarithms to find certain words or phrases

__label__noRel	newspapers should remain impartial and hate speech leans on an opinion.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	This is totally untrue.Freedom of speech will exist one way or another and newspapers shoul dbe promotign public views by regulated platforms, so they can be in touch with peoples real thinking and also allow othr people form their own opinions about current issues	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	Disinformation is rampant: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/magazine/free-speech.html	I think that education is the way to go about it, Humans must respect opposing views of others and tolerant society should be encouraged at all times instead of censorship
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	I feel that people should be allowed to have freedom of expression online but should be held accountable for vitriolic and unbased hate speech, this could be achieved by proving identity and by using citations and references when posting online
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	You have to log on to write a comment, having character/post limits, comments must be verified by someone who checks for hate speech before approving the comment for publication
__label__noRel	Eliminating space for readers in its entirety removes any possibility of stimulating discussion. While hate speech is a serious consideration, I would hope that it forms a small minority of the comments posted on newspaper websites (but I guess this also depends on the topic since some are more charged than others). Surely some form of regulation would suffice to address the severity of hate speech.	Hate speech is not a criticsm and should be avoided
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Should be reviewed first before it gets published

__label__noRel	good point,i see this daily on my local paper,some people make it their hobby to just run down everything and everyone via the comments section.	some people "troll" by writing inflammatory remarks, but it is fundamental to a free society to have free discussion. Any attempts at calling something "hate speech" will be only about stopping anything that goes against the narratives of the rich establishment.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	Having moderators or AI to automatically remove content that includes keywords with cursing or inflammatory language, having a report/flag button so people can report and remove very offensive things

__label__noRel	If a newspaper does not do anything, it might facilitate hate speech and help it reach to millions of people by simply hosting it on their website. Therefore there is a responsibility.	Hate speech is so prevalent nowadays that proper measures should be taken in order to limit these harmful comments. However to stop people from expressing their opinions is creating another problem altogether. Those who aren't able to make help contributions should be blocked and stripped of their right to do so.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	By having an algorithm that detects and deletes any hate speech comment.
__label__noRel	This makes great sense!	Comments could be checked for hate speech before going live.
__label__noRel	I believe everyone has a different threshold to how much hate speech they can handle. Some might take offence to things that others may not.	Recent political positions in the UK have lead to more fighting for 'free speech' and saying that it is ok to be offended - this is shown in a police news release (https://www.college.police.uk/article/protecting-freedom-expression-updated-guidance).

__label__noRel	how do you regulate what hate speech is and who by?	We need a more thick skin with some of our debate topics if we want to win arguements against "hate"
__label__noRel	I think when there are professionals they can be balanced and have training alongside guidelines which can help guide what is and is not allowed	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	I agree. People should not stay silent through fear of someone taking offence at what they say. How can people figure out what their viewpoints are on things if they aren't allowed to ask questions are think aloud?	up to this point, moderators have done a poor job as evidenced by the amount of hate speech so maybe the answer is simply to remove the ability to comment.

Removing comment sections entirely leaves us with a lack of space for healthy discussion and debate, new ideas and opportunities for learning
__label__noRel	https://www.salon.com/2018/11/17/why-comments-sections-must-die/ While this article seems to agree with this point of view, I still feel that taking away spaces for discussion isn't the way to control hate speech.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	I was completely taken aback by some strong stances to remove the comment space, and the belief in that because Newspapers should be one-sided providers. I would disagree because newspaper share societal information and society should be allowed to engage and be part of the conversation instead of just consuming whatever information is being released for consumption. It has been seen as a result of other newspaper websites removing the comment section that it reduces the trust of the reader because they are aware of the bias of the information they are consuming, and also it reduces the amount of time readers spend on these sites because there is no community engagements.

__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	Hate speech is a form of self publicity. If the community isolates the perpetrators by flagging negative content that would be helpful. Flagged content would then need to be followed by banning perpetrators
__label__noRel	I agree	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	I agree	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	I agree	the comment section should not be disabled as is it there for the readers to engage with the content uploaded so it makes no sense to close it, however there should be restrictions.
__label__noRel	I also agree with this. This solution is a middle ground between two extremes.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	moderating the comments
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	I think we firstly have to call out hate speech in order for people to learn that it is not okay and unacceptable. The reason being online 'haters' tend to abuse their right to free speech such that it infringes upon the next person because they have the comfort of knowing that nobody will find put who they really are and confront them. By calling out users on the newspaper website and responding to their comment as the moderator of the comments, and actually suspending their accounts because of it can go a long way.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	Removing the comment section will only create a bigger revolt and uprise from people that write hate speech, and it will move to another media outlets. So the problem should be treated not silenced it. It is the responsibility of newspapers websites to police hate speech in order to create a safe environment for an healthy discussion about a news article. Otherwise you are cutting short an experience that users might want to have. So by censoring all the comment section your make erverybody pay a price for something that they haven't done. Moderation is the key and should be done my the newspapers websites according to the values they have.
__label__noRel	This is frequently used in social media platforms now, but it can be quite time consuming. Also the tone of a statement can be misinterpreting in text format.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree that providing ID could be a way to help with this.	There should be repercussions to extensive hate speech e.g a limited ban to the forum etc. Use moderators and ensure that users understand the consequences of hate speech commente
__label__noRel	Agree and we should not give a platform for this.	Blocking words does not stop hate, what we need to do is have a filter that alerts a human so that a post. Posts/users should be identifiable to the platform they post on (not identifiable to the post but to the platform should any hate crime be identified)
__label__noRel	newspapers write viewpoint without reproach	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	this outs a limit on free speech	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	By removing the comment section will entice further hate speech on another platform. Rather allow people to give their opinion and block comments that relate to hate speech.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	freedom of speech is important but not at the cost of other rights	we could filter the comments and have a panel to decide
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Everyone shoould be able to express their own ideas but we could have some kind of protection in words the should not be allowed and also have a way to keep moderators on the website, people could be warned that they are doing something wrong and be explained that there IS NO HATE SPEECH and be offered maybe some way to express herself without hurting or damaging others.
__label__noRel	I agree that having at least one moderator present would reduce/eliminate hate speech. It could be done after comments are automatically submitted (delete the hateful comments after public viewing within a certain time frame) or, even better, they can only be posted after careful consideration by the moderator(s), permitting only positive comments.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	100% agree, Comment section is for everyone to present their opinion at all times	The only possible way to reduce hate speech is to have some kind of algorithm that may recognise certain words and phrases. Other than that it would mean moderating the comment section.
__label__noRel	I agree	If comments that create hate speech are removed/moderated, you can not complain about loss of freedom of speech as you are then being discrimantory, rather than speaking freely, and there is a difference.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	appreciate people have different views
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	Im not sure moderation would be the difinitive solution	There needs to be a level of moderation before comments are posted. Comments that are harmful, false or misleading shouldn't be allowed to be put up, but there should still be room for healthy debate.
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree - but how do we do it whilst giving readers some protection?	I strongly feel that comments are an essential part of the readers experience. It assists readers by giving them a broader sense and understanding of the topic being discussed. Removing them would be taking a way an integral part of that experience.
__label__noRel	Report comment buttons would make that comment flagged up to moderators and therfore removed quickly	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	A different perspective	Having moderators or AI to automatically remove content that includes keywords with cursing or inflammatory language, having a report/flag button so people can report and remove very offensive things
__label__noRel	I disagree, the person commenting can do so in a manner that isn't hateful. Only people who choose hate as their platform in getting their opinion across will be blocked. Hopefully these people rethink their approach and try again in a different manner	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	Is space for readers comment really that necessary? Nowadays, with all other social medias available, the conversation can happen on platform made for dialogue. But as practice shows, those "conversations" are often very polarized and everyone is kind of screaming in a void.
__label__noRel	I do not think this is fair on the people who genuinely want to have a fair conversation on the subject.	I found this really interesting, "Khan said the freedom of opinion and expression, including the right to seek, receive and disseminate diverse sources of information, must be upheld by States in times of crises and armed conflict as a precious ‘survival right’ on which people’s lives, health, safety, security and dignity depend." This is similar to what lots of people have been saying regarding worrying that this sort of censorhip could overextend. (https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/10/protect-freedom-expression-vital-survival-right-civilians-armed-conflict-un)
__label__noRel	If required, details can be handed to the authorities if there is a legal breach.	1st position: comments on newspaper articles should not be allowed
__label__noRel	I disagree, comments are how valid opinions are spread and change is made in the world. If there are no comments, there's no feedback.	My position as a reader and my argument is that bases on the rules of speech people have freedom of speech and expression. That should be done in a proper way without insulting others or hating or being racist in your speech. Websites and newspapers should not remove the comments of the people responding to hate speech. This is done according to the rules found in the following article: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230
__label__noRel	This would then stop freedom of speech	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	This would be very helpful	I agree that it all should be reviewed before it is published
__label__noRel	If you eliminate comments completely you both take away the right to free speech and inhibit the ability to have an open discussion about what constitutes hateful and offensive comments	Having read through the opinions of others, my stance has not completely changed. It is important to censor comments, freedom of speech does not always equate to disrespecting the views and opinions of others. While I agree that comments should be censored, I do not agree that every comment should be removed. As mentioned before, a system can be implemented that removes comments with certain words, thus making the comment section a safe space for all who use it.
__label__noRel	we can never be sure when it comes to people. It will be dangerous should people be allowed to express themselves	Regulation of the newspaper comment section should be done. There should be moderators who have the ability to remove certain comments if they feel it is needed.
__label__noRel	I agree completely. People need to be educated	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	If the platform is held accountable for allowing hateful speech, then this would set an example to others, both platforms and people, and eventually there would be more control over this happening freely.	i agree that moderators have their uses but then unless they are trained properly their biases may creep in
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	Reduces clear violations	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I agree with this point of view - a lot of the times I hear people railing against the censorship of hatespeech it is because they aren't aware of the damage they are causing or have been caught out saying something they didn't think was bad to begin with	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	With globalization terms that are derogatory in one country may mean something different in another country most recent example being Lizzo.	This is a win or loose situation. People will still continue with their comments even if it is not on the newspapers website. A person can take a screenshot of the topic and then twit it on twitter and then people will give their different opinions. The newspaper can still allow for readers comment however, the hate speech comments can be filtered. This is a democratic world and people have a right to have an opinion in what becomes available to them
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-63291527
__label__noRel	This can hinder the increase of hate speech by filtering out the hate words	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	There should be a right to free speech and peoples views	Agreed
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	It seems like many users think that having your personally details posted along with your comment would be a deterrent for people to comment hate speech
__label__noRel	Regulation of the comment section will definitely help reduce the hate speech	The words chosen to be used are very essential when in comes to the reader and a writer. The content that is viewed as a hate speech should not be shown to the other readers. It should automatically give a warning to the writer and after 3 warnings they should be blocked as they do not comply with the terms and conditions.
__label__noRel	I agree. People should not stay silent through fear of someone taking offence at what they say. How can people figure out what their viewpoints are on things if they aren't allowed to ask questions are think aloud?	By not providing comment section not unless the article need their opinion. There'll be a note notifying readers to be well mannered.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	Maybe online newspapers can invest in text mining, where if hate speech is detected, the comment will not go through. Or, in the comments section, there could be a greyed message in the background that states a non-tolerance to hate speech.
__label__noRel	yes. good moderators are the key	Just allow people to report bad comments and when it gets to a certain number it should delete the message and send an automatic email to the person who wrote it with a warning.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	Sadly I must agree. Ongoing monitoring of comments would take too much effort and time. It is simpler to just remove the comments and let the newspaper articles stand for themselves. Pople can always link the article to their own twitter post and comment there if they feel the need to add their own thoughts.	The question is? Is hate speech not part of free speech? I think people should be left to express themselves however they feel is appropriate as long as they are not breaking an laws
__label__noRel	Allowing hate speech, only perpetuates prejudice and discrimination.	Despite my defence of human moderators, it seems they too are flawed -- check out this article https://www.technologynetworks.com/informatics/news/ai-trusted-as-much-as-humans-to-flag-hate-speech-365777 -- human moderators are not only prone to bias but also impractical. With the huge wealth of content posted every second online, it is unrealistic to expect humans to be able to view, criticise, and moderate every single comment.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	The pros of removing comment sections would be to eradicate the spreadof hate speech. Certain individuals thrive on adding fuel to fire. In this case having the comment section deleted would be a positive thing. On the other hand only by having differing opinions can discussions and debates happen. So if someone spews hate speech only then can we see the extent to which someone disagrees with a certain group/viewpoint etc. https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea
__label__noRel	Hate speech is complex and jubjective. AI is still developing and not good enough to understand basic debate let alone interpret language, Too easy for AI to take words out of context.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I would say the same	Despite my defence of human moderators, it seems they too are flawed -- check out this article https://www.technologynetworks.com/informatics/news/ai-trusted-as-much-as-humans-to-flag-hate-speech-365777 -- human moderators are not only prone to bias but also impractical. With the huge wealth of content posted every second online, it is unrealistic to expect humans to be able to view, criticise, and moderate every single comment.
__label__noRel	I agree but what is to be done about those who use hate speech? Do we just let them be? And what about the newspaper's reputation? Should they be known as a newspaper that allows people to comment on whatever they like with no repercussions?	I don't think removing the comment section reduces hate speech per se, it just pushes it elsewhere. I can't help feeling this sort of censorship is an infringement on free speech.
__label__noRel	A rounded view of a topic. Ensure that their is a balanced opinion around newspapers. And also offers a check and balance--the public opinion is heard and known around issue raised.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	A possible way to address hate speech on newspaper sites would be to incorporate both human moderators and some sort of AI that monitors for hateful words and comments. The requirement to submit personally identifying information before commenting might also help because without this then anyone can create a fake name that hides the person's true identity so therefore more likely to engage in hate speech. If personal information is required, then hate speech would be less likely.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I think when there are professionals they can be balanced and have training alongside guidelines which can help guide what is and is not allowed	One mainstream way of mitigating hate speech on online comment sections is to pre-moderate comments. This however may lead to a 'biased' viewpoint. A lighter example of this could be how some youtubers delete constructive criticism.
__label__noRel	I agree, there should be a policy on what is considered hate speech therefore making easy to censor hate speech	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	I see that most people have the same idea as I have of having moderated. I did not think about what the guidelines could be and how censoring could be a contributing factor to my stand on having comments moderated, but it still seems like the best solution.
__label__noRel	The law! People break the law through hate speech, so the law needs to be the judge.	We need a more thick skin with some of our debate topics if we want to win arguements against "hate"
__label__noRel	Moderator cannot always be reliable	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	This could be done through public opinion, such as what the general public would consider less restricted and what is acceptable in current society.	Hate speech is a form of self publicity. If the community isolates the perpetrators by flagging negative content that would be helpful. Flagged content would then need to be followed by banning perpetrators
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	most people seem to be of the opinion that cutting comments altogether is not constructive. A good point was made by an individual that viewing opinions from people you like only doesn't help you to grow (echo chamber).
__label__noRel	I agree	More emphasis on moderation of specific language would reduce the risk of hate speech. Also, moderators approving comments before they appear on the website would help.
__label__noRel	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button	By moderating the comment section. Instead of having an individual who may be biased in their moderation, the use of an artificial intelligence software can be introduced to moderate the comment section.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	I'm of the supporting view that the use of AI to filter out Hate speech could prove to be very useful
__label__noRel	I disagree, comment sections allow the public to engage with the news and find people similar to them	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used...

__label__noRel	a team of moderators won't be a viable option because, because people can't posts comments in real time	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	I agree	the newspapers should have an algorithm that can detect comments which go against the community guidelines and ban these accounts. Spam accounts should also be detected and banned if they do no contribute constructively to the newspapers.
__label__noRel	True but sometimes the media can provide false information	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	This will allow online users to think twice before spewing hate speech	One cost-effective way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites while promoting reader comments is to outsource reader comments to social media. Comment sections can show comments for the article from social media platforms, while encouraging users to post comments onto these platforms. This way, hate speech can be reduced by social media platforms, which are more experienced with content moderation, have extensive rules in place, and have economies of scale with regard to content moderation compared to newspapers.
__label__noRel	I agree	Newspaper websites should use human or artificial intelligence-based moderators who can impartially identify hate speech and remove it from their platforms without removing or censoring genuine, constructive comments and perspectives. If AI is used, certain terms and phrases can be added to a database and comments containing them flagged for moderation to remove hate speech fairly.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	While hate speech can be harmful , it can also be helpful. If we can read through the speeches we can be able to determine what the problem is from the comments and improve.We can also create work limit on comments.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	I am reminded while discussing this of the way Daily Mail in UK handles the comments section. It just mentions on top of the comments page that theses comments are not moderated.So it allows everybody to express their opionion. This is how it should be done in my opinion
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	I don't think the best education policy will combat trolls, bad faith actors or targeted/well orchestrated hate campaigns.	A possible way to address hate speech on newspaper sites would be to incorporate both human moderators and some sort of AI that monitors for hateful words and comments. The requirement to submit personally identifying information before commenting might also help because without this then anyone can create a fake name that hides the person's true identity so therefore more likely to engage in hate speech. If personal information is required, then hate speech would be less likely.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	Hate speech can be positive criticism and essential in some posts, altgough it can be offensive and totally uncalled for in other posts. A way in which social media apps regulate and monitor the comments, otherwise people have rights to freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Moderators also have bias	there must be a way to build in logarithms to find certain words or phrases
__label__noRel	Bringing Social Media into the discussion is irrelevant in my opinion. We're specifically talking about removing hate speech from newspaper websites. The whole point of social media is to present opinions, share your life etc A newspapers website should be a place for news to be disseminated	freedom of speech is essential but hate speech is not. comments should be left on but perhaps there could be a programme which finds key words and eliminates the comment if it seems to be hateful
__label__noRel	but what if users arent using their real information, how can the goverment implement it then?	You can let people create an account with a full name so they will have to think more about what they write and can't so easily spew hate
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Asking for their constructive criticism and how it will benefit the individual and community.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	I think this is a task that is hard to do because it has to be done in a way that would not hinder freedom of speech but at the same time not attack people. Thus, I think comments should be flagged depending on the words used but not be deleted until it has been checked.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	We should all have the option to voice our opinion. If doing so can result in hate speech, then we have to find a way to fight it instead of trying to eliminate comments altogether. Flagging certain words or using algorithms could potentially could help hide comments that don't add any value and are just trying to cause harm
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	There will always be a few bad apples in a batch just as there will always be bad people among humanity. Honestly the easiest method of combatting this issue is through the utilization of manual review teams perhaps hired by the newspaper or even paid through revenue made by the articles failing that approach bots can be instantiated with the programmed capability of removing comments that have flagged contents inside them.

__label__noRel	I think this is very important. Hate speech will drive away advertisers as they will not want to be associated with hateful comments. Newspapers will have to stop those comments to retain revenue. Facebook has started to process and it is about time other media outlets follow. https://www.facebook.com/community/whats-new/new-tools-features-nurture-community/	Not allowing anonymous posts as well would force individuals to process comments internally before publishing on a public platform.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	An article proving AI can be helpful, but can struggle to interpret or detect certain things, suggesting manual reviewing is still very important. https://www.latrobe.edu.au/nest/can-combat-rise-online-hate-speech/ On another note, I also think anonymity plays a huge role in what people allow themselves to post online and think that certain platforms should consider only allowing people to comment under their own identity rather than online handles and such.
__label__noRel	This is a good solution which would reduce burden on moderators, whilst also automating some of the process.	We need a more thick skin with some of our debate topics if we want to win arguements against "hate"
__label__noRel	I agree that education is important.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	One sided opinions	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__noRel	i dont think is right	A lot of the times I hear people railing against the censorship of hatespeech it is because they aren't aware of the damage they are causing or have been caught out saying something they didn't think was bad to begin with.

__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Using tool, that automaticully remove discussions where is wrong kind words

It is a tricky one to get the balance correct. There will always be some people in society who are happy to spout nonsense/hatred online as they sit behind a keyboard. At the same time, there will also be people who wish to share their more sensible and respectful views on topics.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	Freedom of speech still has its limits!!
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Large companies need to invest more money in having paiI td moderators to monitor hate speech on their articles. I think all speech excpet for speech inciting people to commit violence or murder should be allowed even if i so not agree with it. I think that to prevent hate sppech it will start with educating young people
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	In the book "Noise" it talks about taking the median for everyones view and making that the regulation. The conversation then becomes which views qualify as each end of this opinion spectrum? Surely not the hateful ones but a modicum of their views so they feel included instead of fuelling their distrust of systems not built for them.	Companies aswell as the users should be liable and held accountable for allowing a platform to be used to share hate speech

__label__noRel	I think this is an invasion of privacy and the internet allows people to be the person they want to be and want to identify as - something they might not feel comfortable doing in real life.	I believe removing the comment section is not a solution and that it actually encourages hate speech
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	I totally agree that hate speech should be limited as some readers do not take it lightly and may harm themselves after reading. I have heard stories about people ending their lives after their stories which often are embarassing are published, and the situation made worse by the comment section.
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	Yes there should be	I think we could have a hold on comments until it is checked and fact checked by a panel of people! Not just one person making the decision. Also I think if there were stricter punishments for hate speech the newspaper would make the person and newspaper think twice.
__label__noRel	You are right. it is the people who do not know, what they are taking about, they make problems	Perhaps newspapers could use similar tools to respondology (https://respondology.com/ ) or hive moderation (https://hivemoderation.com ) that can identify and block hateful speech. This might well work and I think both of these use AI.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	We should have a clear definition for hate speech in order to regulate the comment section. For example, comments suggesting certain groups be harmed or should not exist, and language that suggests these groups are inferior without providing educational evidence. We need to keep the comment section a place of discussion and education.
__label__noRel	This is an interesting point of view and I certainly believe that reducing the level of anonymity may help to moderate opinions.	I feel that people should be allowed to have freedom of expression online but should be held accountable for vitriolic and unbased hate speech, this could be achieved by proving identity and by using citations and references when posting online
__label__noRel	the link provides usefull ways for people to deal with hate speech	People should be told about hate speech and how it affects other people and I think people who participate in hate speech should have some sort of panishment.
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	The use of admins and moderators can be helpful in removing hate speech. They would need strict rules for the public in order to not let their own personal biases judge what is and isn't considered hate speech.
__label__noRel	That could help, although that would take a long of time. Also at the end of the day, whoever writes hateful speech do not see the dangers of what they are doing. According to an article in The Guardian, some people think this is just the internet and it does not reflect true life.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way.

__label__noRel	https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/2377-social-media-hiring.html	I feel like there are certain topics for which disabling comments is the best option. For example extremely sensitive stories about severe crimes or ones that involve children.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	Computers should be able to detect hate speech if there is any and report and remove that comment whinin minutes of posting it
__label__noRel	Banning hate speech cannot be a form of censorship if the views your express incite hate or violoence against other groups.	I think that only people who provided identifying information can post their opinions. Also I agree that there should be AL tools to prevent hate speech. Eliminating hate speech from newspaper websites has nothing to do with the infringement of the free speech right.

__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it.

An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	This comes back to the idea of people thinking they know what is best for the majority, even if they hold a very polarised view.

__label__noRel	IT is absoluety the websites job to police polirising comments if nesccearry to keep peace wihthin the outiside community viewing their newspapers.	There should be some level of censoring to eliminate hate speech, but not to the extent where comments are totally disabled
__label__noRel	People are using hate speech in non sensitive articles too.	By implimenting a system that can filter out all comments before the comments are added to the website or newspaper for the readers to read
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	I am reminded while discussing this of the way Daily Mail in UK handles the comments section.

But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	people should have values and respect for others.Just like facebook written words are monitored and people already know these rules.A set of rules should be set
__label__noRel	This will allow online users to think twice before spewing hate speech	readers comments be moderated and anything that is harmful, hateful or hurtful should be removed. this allows people to exercise their right of freedom of speech but limiting the harm that someones opinion may have
__label__noRel	https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/study-social-media-use-linked-to-decline-mental-health	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	Yes, another way to only limit hate speech is to remove anonymity. Therefore, certain sites can require those to sign-up with their bio and this is verified by moderators. Someone may think twice about being 'hateful' if there are repercussions.	I agree with the point of view that there should be a broad spectrum of moderators to stop any particular biased opinion or agenda from controlling the comments.
__label__noRel	i suppose that for those who do listen and pay attention that this is a good idea as it allows for the idea of freedom of speech aslong as everyone knows what they are saying and how it can effect people	I think you can put a price to the website- a subscription to readers.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	I think that any 'contributors' should have a profile and should not be allowed to use an alias. I also think that there should be moderators looking at every post before it is published online.
__label__noRel	Agreed. And many of these potential solutions are also not successful at limiting harmful content (https://slate.com/technology/2018/05/the-facebook-upvote-and-downvote-experiment-is-a-bust.html). As long as the platform is comforming to the laws of the country then it should not have to introduce further measures to limit hate speech at the expense of preventing free and open discussion.	One mainstream way of mitigating hate speech on online comment sections is to pre-moderate comments. This however may lead to a 'biased' viewpoint. A lighter example of this could be how some youtubers delete constructive criticism.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	I think that the introduction of moderators to remove any hate speech would be beneficial. Perhaps the introduction of guidelines as to what constitutes permitted negative comments.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	Negative thought. I disagree. any effort will definitely make a difference. If hate speech is not monitored at all, racists and narcissistic people tend to grow and get away with so much	I think that a comment section is necessary for engagement and exchange of ideas but having said that, there should be a code for AI embedded within that platform which will be able to detect hate speech or words classified as hate speech then the AI can delete them automatically. Also people can report the comment and the AI should delete the comment within minutes of it being reported.
__label__noRel	An algorithm in itself can be bias and discrimatory as proven by studies, it also may not take into consideration different languages	My position as a reader and my argument is that bases on the rules of speech people have freedom of speech and expression. That should be done in a proper way without insulting others or hating or being racist in your speech. Websites and newspapers should not remove the comments of the people responding to hate speech. This is done according to the rules found in the following article: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	we could use bots the get triggered when certain words are used. The bot will therefore remove the comment andhold it until it has mannually reviewed by a human. Another option can be to allow the users to report comments from other users and if the reports reach a certain threshold then hold that comment for review.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	We need to be very clear about what constitutes hate speech and create severe punishments for those that spread it.

__label__noRel	maybe fake news will be reduced in this way	we can do that by having strict rules on language and hate speech where one can be blocked from commenting or their comments gets removed if there is any negativity

We need to create a society where we can debate with each other respectfully, we can know which platforms to use and not rile each other up without offending.

I know this has been discussed a few times potentially in reply to comments but I'd like to repeat it again: language is complex and you can't simply ban or flag certain terms or phrases and think you catch all the hate speech comments etc. While a report button and the use of a software that can support a human moderator is in essence a good idea, it might also delete comments that do not actually contain HS or completely miss others overall. I think this decision by the newspaper turned into an entire discussion of manageability of monitoring discussion sections and away from the ethical considerations.
__label__noRel	prevents people being upset,	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information.

__label__noRel	It will also prevent a lot of spam and hijacking of the threads.

__label__noRel	I don't think most people would take the time to educate each other about hate speech, and I assume there will be stubborn people that are stuck in their ways and will continue to comment their hateful opinions.	Hate speech is so prevalent nowadays that proper measures should be taken in order to limit these harmful comments. However to stop people from expressing their opinions is creating another problem altogether. Those who aren't able to make help contributions should be blocked and stripped of their right to do so.
__label__noRel	agree	I'd happily see all comments sections removed for the good of the public in general. Nobody needs to know that Tony from Bognor thinks All Them Lot Should Go Home, because Tony is a twat who shouldn't be given a platform.

__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Removing the comment facility in no way infringes free speech. The content providers, newspapers, are at liberty to provide discussion space or not as they see fit. The use of a moderator might be useful but this seems a great investment of time to little effect. There are obviously those who enjoy using comment spaces to express extreme and unthought out opinions as well as to insert hate speech. Perhaps only those who have subscribed to a news source should be allowed to comment.
__label__noRel	Could be a good start. I ofen will reaserch/lokup infomation. AS	We do have to allow people to express their opinions - we can't pretend opinions don't exist. Having them out in the open lets us know what we're dealing with. But at the same time hate speech can't be allowed to flourish and absolutely needs to be challenged. There is a role for AI (which I have said before I know) to try and weed out and remove anything that is just pure hate and not any sort of coherent argument or opinion.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	Yes there must be a a strong policy for reviewal before publishing.

__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	although I do think that, however, we should consider how many people do in fact post hateful comments without the protection of anonymity. look at Facebook, for instance - it's absolutely full of hate speech from people posting under their names using accounts that people can view and learn more about them. perhaps if people are truly hateful then being known for this isn't a problem for them after all.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	Does not allow for positive feedback	I'm a firm supporter of freedom of speech but the internet as we all know can be a cruel place.

So with that being said I stand for the elimination of the space bar for readers.
__label__noRel	it has to be completely restricted	Maybe online newspapers can invest in text mining, where if hate speech is detected, the comment will not go through. Or, in the comments section, there could be a greyed message in the background that states a non-tolerance to hate speech.

People will put hate speech in. The only way to stop it, I think is to not allow comments to be made. Technically, that's what happens with print versions of newspapers. We just read the article. Anyone who wants to express an opinion can write a letter to the editor. (Who would screen out hate stuff!). But, we live in an online world. So people expect to be able to have their say. And people probably wouldn't subscribe if they can't interact on an online service. Anyway, I do think people having verified accounts might help.

__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	I believe that people are allowed to express their opinions , that is why we have freedom of speech. However with that right, we are not subjected to hate speech, there are so many ways of expressing yourself without using offensive or hateful words. Considering a newspaper is a public platform, I believe everyone should try to be respective at all times. The comment space must not be removed, it helps to get insights of readers and is very helpful. I think the website should be enhanced in a way that it detects offensive language and doesn't allow the reader to continue if they use such. Also, comments should be monitored before being posted to the public.
__label__noRel	hate speech can be aggressive	Freedpn of speech doesnt mean you must promote hate speech on newspapers, it basically means you free to voice out your concerns in around society in a more respectfull manner.
__label__noRel	One person's hate speech is another person's free speech. Who decides? It's tricky. See the attached article.	the best way is for companies to filter hate speech and remove it as long as the criteria for hate speech comes from an independent organisation. If companies themselves govern what is hate speech then we would become subject to there rules which you would lose the point of freedom of speech. Also there should be more support in the community for people who are being targeted in hate speech attacks.
__label__noRel	I agree with your opinion. I think trying to find ways to moderate the comments (either automatically or by a team of humans) would be a good step.

__label__noRel	I think that removing the comment section on specific topics is important	I agree that the only way to ensure balanced discussion without allowing hate or eliminating genuine responses is through moderation of comments before posting
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.

__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	by not allowing certain words to be used in the comments space
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	Hate speech will forever be a problem in society and its up to the newspapers website to make sure they publish newsworthy news that even if they come across negative comments, they know that on their side their story is true and there a no loopholes
__label__noRel	I don't think banning people from commenting would lead them to do something more powerful or extreme.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it.

__label__noRel	I agree with Ian.	Although it would be fair to allow for both critical and positive input, I believe that newspaper websites should have a mechanism in place that can identify hate speech and restrict individuals who use it. This would prevent readers from freely using hate speech.

__label__noRel	Absolutely, the issue of sharing inflammatory or misleading news is important to address and change. News outlets are responsible for how they present their stories and how the narrative changes in the comment section below. They're also responsible for the real world violence as a result of willingly hosting hate speech on their platform whether they're active or inactive on their handling of the comments sections.	There is no need to reduce hate speech, we just need to accept it. Banning or reducing hate speech is just censorship which is not acceptable.
__label__noRel	it would give focus to the journalism.	I think in order to eliminate hate speech, the comment section itself must be completely eradicated to take a way all potential risk. Newspapers have the sole purpose of giving accurate depictions of current events, there is no responsibility for them to offer social commentary space. One only has to look at the hatred filled comments of the Daily Mail web pages to see the concerning language being used on a regular basis.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	I think that hate speech should be reduced through widescale education about the origins, hurts and trauma behind words which are used. By educating people learn how to respect or debate in effective ways without insulting or offending. UNESCO are suggesting that addressing hate speech through education can bring respect for each other.
__label__noRel	I disagree, people know the damage but do not care. They hide behind relative anonymity and so do not worry about what people think of their posts. Like many things, you can educate as much as you want but if people choose not to listen it will make no difference	This article made me reflect on the definition of hate speech and I aggree with blocking comments that go against a persons protected characteristics - if a comment like that is made, it should instantly be banned from the platform / comment section. https://about.fb.com/news/2017/06/hard-questions-hate-speech/
__label__noRel	Hate speech must be controlled in some how.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

A reporting site that is accessible across all platforms would be a good start like https://www.report-it.org.uk/reporting_internet_hate_crime.
__label__noRel	All in all, the newspaper comment section should not be cancelled.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	Do you believe that a newspaper comment section is an appropriate system for dialogue with someone spreading hateful messages?	Space on comments is a must have because many users get to participate into a good course that could help many others and therefore those spewing hate should be harshly dealt with. Blocked actively so
__label__noRel	It may prevent multiples accounts from one user	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	" Blocking users or deleting comments because they express critical opinions offends the Constitution and principles of transparency" - https://www.aclu-nj.org/en/know-your-rights/when-public-officials-censor-you-social-media	It goes further than this. We live in a society that has a lot of cry babies. We need to be impervious to negative comments from strangers on a social platform and that is anonymous. Most people need to grow a pair, develop a spine or stop being cry babies. Once this is achieved you will see that any contribution you make to a discussion will be debated in a civilized manner.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	you cannot eliminate it. dont try. freedom of speech is importante and we must appreciae others have different view
__label__noRel	If comments are really harmful towards certain groups of people I would rather that the provider cuts them off.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	If we are to ban everyone who post a hateful comment we would be infringing on their basic right of freedom of speech. But the question still remains, when is it just a hateful comment and not hatred or propaganda. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression in press and other media. To some extent we dont have a right to block them from expressing their thoughts
__label__noRel	It can be difficult to automate this monitoring	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	Newspapers are nationally available.As are there websites.Whilst newspapers cant be held responsible for the comments of its readers ,i do think they should have a moderater to delete harmfull posts that could offend.	There should be people assigned to go over the comments provided in order to ensure that the final approved posts do not contain hate speech. Basically a team set up to censor comments accordingly
__label__noRel	Hate speech is bad and must not be tolarated	I agree that free speech should be honoured and upheld. That being said, newspapers are their own entities that should have autonomy over their interactions and comments from readers. Therefore, I think the use of moderators, filtering out certain offensive language, and strict and visible posting guidelines are good ways to reduce hate speech on these websites.
__label__noRel	i think so,people should be able to express their views but comments must be moderated	appreciate people have different views
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	By a combination of monitoring and blocking people who leave such comments, and also having suitable laws in place to back this up
__label__noRel	While I see the logic to this argument, the publics interaction with paper newspapers and slower press looks to have declined according to this article, therefore I'm not sure this solution would work: https://clubs.waketech.edu/wake-review/magazine/creative-writing/non-fiction/the-decline-in-newspapers-a-closer-look-joseph-ahrens/	There need to be some kind of moderation, either before or after comments are published
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	Even though I am generally curious to read other people's comments, I think the best would actually be to eliminate comments altogether, or restrict to the way paper news work, i.e. you can write a letter and they might publish it next time.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	People tend to comment just to rile others up, which means it will be a lot of work to moderate. Perhaps an all or nothing approach is best.
__label__noRel	I agree, feelings should be left out when giving your views.	The only way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites is letting the readers know that if they comment with negative words on the comment section they will be blocked
__label__noRel	yes true i find no one really reads those comments anyways	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	I like the idea of allowing readers to flag comments deemed as inappropriate, perhaps with a limit of how many they can do, otherwise I can see some taking advantage of this feature and flagging every comment they disagree with.	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__noRel	You make a good point - why do we need to give a platform for people to just say mean things hiding behind their computers when they wouldn't say that in real life.	Hate speech is something people intentionally and so if people continue to participate in it, they should be punished.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	In as much as we can not let the spread of hate speech continue, closing the comment section is not the solution. The newspaper website should have the option for readers to be able to report comments that include hate speech and moderators should be appointed to check "users" that are violating the rules. There can be filters in place that remove posts that have some of the common hateful and derogatory phrases. outlining the rules and regulations for the website users can help
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	The best solution would be one that elegantly ties the reduction of hate speech in the comment section with no detrimental effect to the publics freedom of speech. This could be done by setting guidelines for hate speech, and also ensuring that the public provides identifying information such as their email address and especially their phone number. Both can be tracked to the person. To take it even further would be to be able to collect data such as ip addresses( with the commenters permission of course) when the person sends their comment so as to be able hold them accountable for any hate speech they send in. This will prevent people from using such language and hoping to hide under anonymity.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	Again I think that removing comment sections entirely would overall be a negative thing. Yes, there are people who abuse the comments section and it they can use it to promote hate speech, but with the right tools this could be moderated. Removing comment sections entirely leaves us with a lack of space for healthy discussion and debate, new ideas and opportunities for learning
__label__noRel	I agree with this point. Hate speech just spreads more hate among people.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__noRel	Moderator biases	Only People from certain age should be allowed to comment
__label__noRel	people will find a way to comment horrible things elsewhere in newspapers	I am unsure if there is a way to reduce hate speech. One persons 'hate speech' is anothers 'freedom of speech'. As a supposedly democratic nation, we need to be able to permit people from all walks of lives and experiences to air their own personal views, whether these are educated views or not.
__label__noRel	it would be nice if the comment could be made visible after it has been removed. others can know what to avoid and if it is NOT actually hate speech the conversation could be continued don't you think?	Stop calling it hate speech maybe it is just another opinion

__label__noRel	I think this is very important. Hate speech will drive away advertisers as they will not want to be associated with hateful comments. Newspapers will have to stop those comments to retain revenue. Facebook has started to process and it is about time other media outlets follow. https://www.facebook.com/community/whats-new/new-tools-features-nurture-community/	I think newspapers websites should introduce a bot that would delete automatically all posts that have too many hate words in it.
__label__noRel	One sided opinions	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	Newspaper websites should implement ways such as word filters, moderators and more strict rules and regulations to prevent post that include hate speech to be minimised. They can also educate people about the dangers of hate speech. "Fight back against harmful messages in public places by publicly standing with victims in solidarity" https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/combat-onlin-hate-speech/
__label__noRel	In my opinion freedom of speech stops when it is directed hate towards a person or a group of people. Online platforms do not have to tolerate hate speech on their platforms.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	There needs to be some form of restriction on the content of speech, can you imagine if everyone was given free reigh?	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	I think through fair moderation, then the amount of hate speech will be reduced.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	By using a tool that searches for likely words: hate, etc.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Comments should be regulated, but comment space should not be removed.
__label__noRel	This will allow online users to think twice before spewing hate speech	https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons
__label__noRel	I dissagree, it should be a safe space for everyone.. people have a right to disagree but not use inflammatory hate speech.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	They can be made visible	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	Removing the comments limits speech, it goes against our freedom	I think by holding the people that use hateful speech accountable i.e., blocking them from accessing newspaper websites
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	Filter words so if a comment contains this word it will be reviewed as to if it is appropriate or automatically deleted
__label__noRel	Unfortunately there will always be some who will abuse this freedom	should be open to all
__label__noRel	Fixing the root cause would be most beneficial.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	we should keep comment sections on newspaper websites but we should have moderators to filter out any hate speech
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	Control what is printed or posted to make sure that it is diverse and does not contain any hate speech but the message they are trying to get across they are able to. That way newspaper can leave the comment section and different opinions are heard and expressed and no one gets hurt.
__label__noRel	I agree that comments should filtered	There could be a segment in the website that gives informed context to a subject to prevent uninformed comments and furthermore the newspaper should monitor the comments and censor any hate speech comments.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	we could filter the comments and have a panel to decide
__label__noRel	needs to be installed	The comment section needs to be moderated using some kind of filter to automatically filter any words on the banned list and then use a report system to flag up anything which tries to bypass this. This will allow a human moderator to quickly decide what can be kept and what needs action.
__label__noRel	all criticism cannot be considered hate crime, sometimes it can be the harsh truth. How can we make sure these comments don't get deleted too.	Awareness campaigns need to be implemented to teach people about the significance of avoiding hate speech.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	Having read through the opinions of others, my stance has not completely changed. It is important to censor comments, freedom of speech does not always equate to disrespecting the views and opinions of others. While I agree that comments should be censored, I do not agree that every comment should be removed. As mentioned before, a system can be implemented that removes comments with certain words, thus making the comment section a safe space for all who use it.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Just pay moderators
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	Someone should monitor the chat, and those who use hate speech should be given 1 warning before being removed from the website.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	Much as I agree that's probably ideal as far as not requiring constant monitoring of the sort that's only really feasible for a relatively small amount of newer articles, the kind of technology for properly filtering such things isn't quite there yet, beyond simply checking for specific language. ...and it's worth noting, even if it was, whoever writes the algorithm also decides what is worthy of being removed. Being able to cull commentary automatically this way is potentially even more damaging if your concern is freedom of speech.	Hate speech poses grave dangers for the cohesion of a democratic society. It can lead to acts of violence and conflict on a wider scale.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	i think minimum news coverage should be given to hate speech and it shouuld be very stictley monitered as well
__label__noRel	blocking certain words could automatically delete comments that are not necessarily hateful to another person	It hink a moderation is required for hate speech. Removing the entire comment section is not an ideal option. However, hate speech is alsoa crime. It is clear that there should be some monitoring in social media in terms of tracking down the user when necessary so similar terms with the real world would be valid. If you make a crime in real word you get you will stand trial so similar option should be valid for social media.
__label__noRel	Free speech has a limit, and there is no reason why people should be allowed to post hate speech online.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	There are some good points however in having news sites require users to submit data they risk each users' privacy and right to anonymity. This could be increadibly dangerous and would encourage people to stop using the site	create an algorithm that identifies hate speech and removes it
__label__noRel	I disagree people need to show what they think about what has been written	ALthough the idea of free speech is important, it cannot be used as an excuse to upset others and use racist/sexist/ violent language.
__label__noRel	I agree, as people need to be made aware that sometimes, what they say and think could offend other people.	hate speech revolves around certain words or slurs so if those word can be banned or even not allowed and the comment does not show up on the actual site it will help curb hate speech
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	Flag known and "popular" derogatory terms automatically through the platform which does not allow you to post the comment without using the politically correct terms
__label__noRel	hate speech is not free speech	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	There should be ways to monitor the type of language used, perhaps through AI. It should be able to pick up key words related to hate speech.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	The best solution would be one that elegantly ties the reduction of hate speech in the comment section with no detrimental effect to the publics freedom of speech. This could be done by setting guidelines for hate speech, and also ensuring that the public provides identifying information such as their email address and especially their phone number. Both can be tracked to the person. To take it even further would be to be able to collect data such as ip addresses( with the commenters permission of course) when the person sends their comment so as to be able hold them accountable for any hate speech they send in. This will prevent people from using such language and hoping to hide under anonymity.
__label__noRel	I agree	Certain hateful words/phrases could be blocked or they could introduce a reporting option in the comments section.
__label__noRel	I agree with this comment. I really would encourage people to educate other people about the consequences and reasons behind hate speech. These factors might contribute to reduce it	Hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by educating people about the consequences of hate speech and what they can do to someone else.
__label__noRel	I agree because it will be easy to identify hate speech like this without completely taking away the ability to express opinions	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	Having the option for complete anonimity and alter egos should be removed. I believe people will be much more careful with what they say if their name and face is attached to it.
__label__noRel	Whoever creates the algorithm then ultimately decides what is hate speech. There need to be a common neutral definition of what hate speech is before any kind of censorship algorithm can be developed.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	But should we then allow "freedom of speech" to propagate into free hate speech for anyone to use on the platform. Only through learning and understanding that there are rules and responsibilities can one start removing forms of hate speech. There should be regulations put in place for offenders.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	I agree completely. People need to be educated	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	I think we need to develop a way to recognize hate speech in comments so that it is easy to monitor comment sections for derogatory and offensive language. There are studies on how to go about this for example if you follow this link it talks about "A Feature-Based Approach to Assess Hate Speech in User Comments" https://www.cairn.info/revue-questions-de-communication-2020-2-page-529.htm

__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	Perhaps newspapers could use similar tools to respondology (https://respondology.com/ ) or hive moderation (https://hivemoderation.com ) that can identify and block hateful speech. This might well work and I think both of these use AI.
__label__noRel	I agree with this as it is important to allow freedom of speech, however, not to the detriment of others. There need to be acceptable guidelines.

__label__noRel	I completely agree that education should be involved. The issue is that this doesn't have immediate affects and therefore this is why moderating the comment sections combined with education is key.	there must be a way to build in logarithms to find certain words or phrases
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	A pop-up can be used which reads "if any 'hate speech' comment is discovered, it will be removed from these comments".
__label__noRel	depression and peer pressure should really call out to ones morals and values as a human being.	1. Only allow verified accounts to post - these accounts should be easily traced back to individuals. 2. Moderate comments with both algorithms and human visibility. 3. Prosecute.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	It is easy to be hateful online when you are anonymous. Before being able to comment on newspaper websites, users should be required to sign up using traceable methods (eg. some form of identification). The comment section should regularly be monitored and any users who post hate speech should face serious consiquences
__label__noRel	Define aggressive, some reddit subs ban gendered language which is over moderation in my opinion when you look at the content of a word not the technical definition of it sometimes. Like saying "I'm having a bitch of a time" vs "you're a bitch".	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	I agree that most if not all online news articles do not need a comments section. However, I believe having a note to tell readers to be well mannered would not stop readers from posting hate speech if they had intended to do so in the first place.

__label__noRel	I'm not convinced this is a helpful input in its own way.	have word filters
__label__noRel	Removal of hate speech is not too much power, but hate speech needs to be clearly defined and a set of rules adhered to.	Hire moderators and similar positions, and also having filtering systems
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be ignored, but does not eliminate it being seen and still potentially causing issues	Limiting the algorithms push to only show negative or controversial viewpoints would go a long way to decreasing the hate comments.
__label__noRel	disagree, chat feature is useful	you cannot eliminate it. dont try. freedom of speech is importante and we must appreciae others have different view
__label__noRel	In an ideal world perhaps, but how would you recognise 'hate speech' and police this in practical terms without infringing civil liberties and free speech. AI offers one avenue, but many challenges remain and there are many risks with this approach: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0221152	ithink the best thing to do is to not have comments as that can really alter someone elses perception. Especially in this day and age people tend to rely on comments to then pass their own judgement and that can cause hate speech. However if the comments were to still be present i think an idea would be to mute comments that incite any type of hate.
__label__noRel	Exactly correct, there's no evidence to show removal or prohibition of user commentary actually reduces hate speech. Users simply find alternative means to express their thoughts. If you're aware of the popular meme 'in minecraft' illustrates this principle in its rudimentary form.	Free speech is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it is necessary for an effective democratic society and on the other hand, people tend to abuse the right. Newspapers and publishing companies are major symbols of free speech, however, and there will always be disadvantages to be endured, hate speech inclusive. The solution is not to disable comment spaces but to continually implore and push for cooperation amongst readers.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	Newspaper websites should invest more in technology that can be used to detect hate speech and not allow it to be posted. They should only allow comments posted in the language that the software will understand so that it is able to eliminate hate speech without difficulties. they should also be willing to punish people who post hate speech by reporting them to the authorities.
__label__noRel	I don't think "ineffective" is right word to use, I think 80% of the suggestions would somehow have an effect on this because it it a measure after all, it may not completely address or eliminate hate speech but it will have an effect.

__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.

__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	There should be hate speech words that should be used to warn the user and not allow them to post by disabling the post button if there are hate speech words.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	I'm finding replying to comments here really awkward. As soon as I start typing the page moves, grrrr! However, I don't agree with vetting comments. I do agree with free speech, but not hate speech. People are entitled to an opinion without having to be nasty or a keyboard warrior. Moderating could be used to take out hateful comments, without taking away a well rounded debate, but where those lines are drawn is anyones guess!
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.

__label__noRel	I agree with Richard in so far as newspapers to this point mostly haven't had very successful moderating systems. Either they are unaware of current methods of spreading misinformation or they bring down the ban hammer so quickly that it makes their comments confusing	By using a tool to search for hate speech
__label__noRel	Guidelines could be very useful to set up rules for what is and isn't allowed on the website. Then, everyone has a clear understanding of the moderator's goals and reasonings.	The editor must appoint a diverse panel, meaning from different backgrounds to screen comments
__label__noRel	I agree	I think this is a task that is hard to do because it has to be done in a way that would not hinder freedom of speech but at the same time not attack people. Thus, I think comments should be flagged depending on the words used but not be deleted until it has been checked.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	Banning comment section is not a solution at all, the ban of comment sections is also the ban of freedom of speech/ opinions over all. The idea behind comment sections is for readers to share their different thoughts regarding the News with each other which is very important.	I totally agree that hate speech should be limited as some readers do not take it lightly and may harm themselves after reading. I have heard stories about people ending their lives after their stories which often are embarassing are published, and the situation made worse by the comment section.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	But what about those who were going to give positive comments. I believe comments should just be monitored
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	we can reduce hate speech by blocking out certain words so that it can not be viewed publicly. and blocking the user using hate speech
__label__noRel	the thing is people always find a way to say those certain words.	we could use bots the get triggered when certain words are used. The bot will therefore remove the comment andhold it until it has mannually reviewed by a human. Another option can be to allow the users to report comments from other users and if the reports reach a certain threshold then hold that comment for review.
__label__noRel	I think using AI would not prove to be very effective. If this AI was to be self-supervised (without any moderators) I think it would quickly start flagging not-hateful comments as hate speech since it's very susceptible to user input - see what happened to Microsoft's Twitter bot Tay. After a couple of weeks, if I'm not mistaken, the AI started posting very hateful tweets about the holocaust and minorities.	I think that things should be reviewed by a moderator, but it is a tough decision what is considered hate speech and what is someone's opinion.
__label__noRel	Tasking whole units with not only moderation of hate speech but also tracking it and analysing it for trends is a huge additional workload for an already stretched sector. It sounds great, but likely unrealistic in terms of newspaper resources.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.

__label__noRel	Also it's not about restricting any form of hate speech, we also need to be reminded that our opinions can't be the only right one. Hate speech is hate, and a crime against who ever is being undermined	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	Removing the comment section from online newspapers is not the answer. Allowing people to post their opinions is healthy and a normal part of human society- people will not always agree. However, in order to reduce hate speech, which can so often lead to crime, it could be done so that there are monitors (either human or computer) who check comments before they are posted to ensure they are not hate speech.
__label__noRel	Allowing people to express their opinions ensures that there is free speech	There absolutely are ways to facilitate healthy conversation and debates without allowing hate speech. Both algorithms and human moderation are ways to ensure debate can continue without resorting to abuse.
__label__noRel	Its ok to have some negative comments as long as they are balanced and not offensive or personal	By having stricter controls over who can sign up to the comments and blocking them from the sites when they use hate speech. It's unfortunate that it happens, but sometimes they are loud just to get attention. Starve them of it.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	Newspaper websites should invest more in technology that can be used to detect hate speech and not allow it to be posted.

Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	This is interesting! I read an article about moderators with different policies on what constitutes hate speech and should be removed.

I agree with the notion that being able to share our thoughts and feelings is a right and having people share their views can help people to question their own thoughts.

__label__noRel	it would take a lot of time before the news are released	Maybe online newspapers can invest in text mining, where if hate speech is detected, the comment will not go through. Or, in the comments section, there could be a greyed message in the background that states a non-tolerance to hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	I don't want to see the comments space removed as it amounts to censorship. I'd much rather that people saw what other people thought and were able to consider it. Hopefully, readers will recognise when some people are irrational and will not add fuel to the fire. Good moderators would help but they mustn't be trigger happy. They must allow dissent and only remove what it clearly offensive.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.

__label__noRel	Algorithims can be trained to understand what words to display and what not too.	I think that moderation is the most effective way of preventing hate speech.

__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it.

Hate speech must be banned totally from the online publications.

__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted.

__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?

__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	Could be successful in reducing hate speech and controlling potentially harmful hate speech.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.

__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	This is not a black or white topic. The question is how exactly we define hate speech. Criticism in itself is not hate speech, but it is easy to take things to extremes, especially when someone expresses their opinion anonymously. Education about the reasons is important to better understand our own feelings and behaviour. Educate people do not restrict them!
__label__noRel	we should be able to share love, this world needs that	Filter comments or have a ban on words that come across as hateful.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	Go through and censor out certain words

The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	yes we need to be able to express our opinions	Hate speech invites violence and undermines people
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	It goes further than this. We live in a society that has a lot of cry babies. We need to be impervious to negative comments from strangers on a social platform and that is anonymous. Most people need to grow a pair, develop a spine or stop being cry babies. Once this is achieved you will see that any contribution you make to a discussion will be debated in a civilized manner.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	I think rather than removing the option to comment/debate below an article, there could be moderators and hate speech buttons and bots to keep hate speech at bay.
__label__noRel	Using algorithms is a valid option for many things, but analyzing text is still quite difficult for computers. They're are not very good at detecting sarcasm or irony, for instance.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	due to the changing world and the improvement of technology,the internet is like a black canvas and anyone can put anything they want on it,but even though technology is improving most websites dont use basic protection,they could do things like add comment filters,then this ensures that hateful words or phrases cannot be used but positive and informative words and statements can be

__label__noRel	I agree with this! It would reduce hate speech.	I don't think newspapers, who have already seen their takings plummet in recent years due to everything moving online, will want to pay to employ moderators for their articles.

This topic is a massive minefield and I don't think there is a simple solution to it.

The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	In summary, I think we should not remove comment sections. We need to "teach" AI to filter the comment section on newspaper websites. In that way, we can add or remove filters, and AI will simply do the work of making sure the comment section is appropriate.

I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words.

__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	I think one way to reduce hate speech online would be monitoring the message.

__label__noRel	Accountability is a great idea	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	I agree	As I saw some commentary on this platform, my opinion is that we need 2 things.

__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	I believe some sort of regulation in media will always be necessary to decrease the damage hate speech might cause -- comments space included. We still need to get to the bottom of the issue, though.
__label__noRel	the thing is people always find a way to say those certain words.	Removing the comment section will not be effective since there will not be any interactions between readers.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	This is an interesting point of view and I certainly believe that reducing the level of anonymity may help to moderate opinions.	maybe make the comment section questions and answers about the article so comments are stictley moderated
__label__noRel	It's true that hate speech is discriminatory and can constitute violence, but not all comments on news platforms are hate speech, and some are constructive. People should be allowed to share their authentic views on a subject, as long as those views do not discriminate against specific groups of people.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	absolutely agree with this and think that this could lead to people have openminded discussions and would promote a different way of thinking which is okay	Through active moderation.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	These comments are on their sites and it is their responsibility to control them. Some comments may be discriminating and therefore do not belong on the site	I strongly feel that comments are an essential part of the readers experience. It assists readers by giving them a broader sense and understanding of the topic being discussed. Removing them would be taking a way an integral part of that experience.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	It is true that it would be difficult to remove and control all of the comments however i think it would be a lot more damaging to remove the right to freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	A possible way to address hate speech on newspaper sites would be to incorporate both human moderators and some sort of AI that monitors for hateful words and comments. The requirement to submit personally identifying information before commenting might also help because without this then anyone can create a fake name that hides the person's true identity so therefore more likely to engage in hate speech. If personal information is required, then hate speech would be less likely.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	Removing the comment section from online newspapers is not the answer. Allowing people to post their opinions is healthy and a normal part of human society- people will not always agree. However, in order to reduce hate speech, which can so often lead to crime, it could be done so that there are monitors (either human or computer) who check comments before they are posted to ensure they are not hate speech.
__label__noRel	It's a good idea to reduce anonymity so more people can be linked to the things they say and rightly may think twice about coming across as a hateful person.	appreciate people have different views
__label__noRel	It would reduce hate comments to the max.	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	user logins can allow for better regulation of comments
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	Comment sections need to be well-moderated, and if algoritmic or user comment flagging is used this needs to also be reviewed by a human moderator to ensure that there is no bias or bad faith reporting going on.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	by checking what people comment befor approval
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	The most effective way would be to produce effective and fair algorithms that can detect use of hate speech along with help of human moderation.
__label__noRel	Privacy concern.	The best way to curb hate speech would be to have the comments section moderated for any forms of hate speech. In this manner people who have an opinion with substance can have a say in whatever article that was published.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	I think we could have a hold on comments until it is checked and fact checked by a panel of people! Not just one person making the decision. Also I think if there were stricter punishments for hate speech the newspaper would make the person and newspaper think twice.
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	Maybe the only solution is to remove the space for comments? We see the same issues on other platforms that allow comments!
__label__noRel	Hoping that they may publish is wishful thinking as well unless they have a system for it.	freedom speech is good but it assumes that common sense prevails too
__label__noRel	Absolutely correct. The important thing is to identify what hate speech actually means, because what is offensive to one individual might not be to another.	Strict moderation of comments prior to them being published may be the only way to limit hate speech on comments sections.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	The problem is that people can register an account giving false details, so how do we ensure they have given their correct age for example?	the comments with hate speech can be remove. and the commenter should be ban for a period of time
__label__noRel	Agree, it is essential to monitor hate	This is an interesting point - I wonder if some websites already use AI to moderate user comments and posts. I think AI could be trained to recognise hate speech, although it would have to be tested first as it could censor too much.
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	I used to moderate a forum. The administrator set up various parameters for keyword triggers. There would be a lot of spurious reports due to poor spelling or grammar use - for example you would get a post flagged up for mentioning the word "hoe" however from the entire sentence it was clear they actually mistyped "home" - the system is not foolproof.	Have monitoring software be used. The comment section should not be removed, because it then deprives the general public of their opinion and freedom of speech as well as addressing any inaccuracies that were mentioned in articles.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	I definately think the way forward is to have moderators that will review all comments before they get posted.They can then approve or disapprove all the comments and flag inappropiate user names. Yiou could also add a way for the readers to flag inappropiate comments and these will also flag to the moderators.
__label__noRel	freedom of speech	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	HATE SPEECH is speech that is vulgar and intended to offend.	Charactertisation of hate speech should be done case-by-case, rather than applied universally
__label__noRel	Readers should be able to challenge the editorial views of the newspaper / individual journalist otherwise the newspaper just becomes an echo chamber.	The comments section may be removed on especially conflicting topics/conversations.
__label__noRel	It helps other people contribute their feelings	I agree with most of the commenters here, there needs to be moderation. Even if you don't agree with the arguments there are ways of saying it that do not fall into 'hate speech'.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	While hate speech can be harmful , it can also be helpful. If we can read through the speeches we can be able to determine what the problem is from the comments and improve.We can also create work limit on comments.
__label__noRel	Personally I like to read other peoples' comments, it can offer an alternative view to the first comment being made and it opens your mind to accepting other views.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	have an active moderator to remove any hate speech
__label__noRel	I think that would be unfair to other people who do not post hate speech.	Be more strict when allowing people to create profiles, that require identification before allowing anybody to comment. Stopping people being anonymous enough to feel confident while posting hate speech I think will be more beneficial than restricting peoples comments.
__label__noRel	Discussion will always happen. This would encourage discussion to happen elsewhere in forums without direct reference to the news article or without any moderation. It also pushes discussion into social media platforms where discussion tends to be more polarised and less productive.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	However it should be note that the AI should not be programmed with inherant biases of the programmer(s)	Moderation of both users and comments isn't difficult to implement and will weed out the idiots that want to ruin it.
__label__noRel	I agree, and this can be further enocouraged if the writerr or journalist engages with the comments that are being made on their story	I definately think the way forward is to have moderators that will review all comments before they get posted.They can then approve or disapprove all the comments and flag inappropiate user names. Yiou could also add a way for the readers to flag inappropiate comments and these will also flag to the moderators.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	I agree with this as the comment section will be filled with hate speech that could be upsetting for some	news media can look into AI technology to solve such problems.the machine will detect faul speeach and instantly hide or delete the comment ,then send a warning to the post writer
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	In my opinion the comment section should not be removed. I personally get very annoyed if I watch or read something and want to express my opinion, then go down to the comment section to sadly find out the comments are turned off. This limits the freedom of speech and blocks the ability for the people to vent out somehow. I think this builds aggression and causes problems afterwards. The better thing to do is to limit bad speech, foul words and cursing but removing the comments completely is not a good idea.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	hate speech must be clearly defined, it should not be left to the media to decide what is and is not considered hate speech
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	I'd happily see all comments sections removed for the good of the public in general. Nobody needs to know that Tony from Bognor thinks All Them Lot Should Go Home, because Tony is a twat who shouldn't be given a platform.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	Using moderators, educating users, calling out trolls and haters!
__label__noRel	I definitely agree with your position, a certain level of regulation is needed, as looking at the current situation there are still many problems regarding online comments.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	Hate speech can cause unnecessary harm and the removal of a space for readers comments would overall be a good thing that would not take away from the experience of reading the articles.	There is no cure for hate speech, but there is a way to stand up against it. Speak out against hate speech - fight racism and bigotry with love, empathy, compassion, and strength. We may not be able to eliminate hatred entirely, but the more steps we can take to educate and support human beings, and speak out against injustice, the better this world will become. Resources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech
__label__noRel	Completely agree - there's a lot of evidence out there to support this https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people.

__label__noRel	This is one of the most sane posts in this discussion. Thank you.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Is it really hate speech or is it just an opinion that we don't want to hear?

__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	Although it would be fair to allow for both critical and positive input, I believe that newspaper websites should have a mechanism in place that can identify hate speech and restrict individuals who use it. This would prevent readers from freely using hate speech.

__label__noRel	The problem is can an algorithm actually make the full determination of what is hateful and not? It may have the same biases.	Freedom of speech still has its limits!!
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	This is a good article in how to combat hate speech comments: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	Hate speech online absolutely must be eliminated and we should not encourage it within online platforms. Hate speech can and does lead to violence which is more severe than 'being horrible online'. https://www.coe.int/web/european-commission-against-racism-and-intolerance/hate-speech-and-violence
__label__noRel	I agree, and this can be further enocouraged if the writerr or journalist engages with the comments that are being made on their story	Having the option for complete anonimity and alter egos should be removed. I believe people will be much more careful with what they say if their name and face is attached to it.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	We can fairly reduce hate speech from newspapers websites without eliminating space for readers comments by encouraging people to give a reward who will comment without hate speech.
__label__noRel	Agree with regulating it	monitor the comments that are posted
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	Newspapers could censor certain words that are deemed hateful. This could be done automatically.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	I think we firstly have to call out hate speech in order for people to learn that it is not okay and unacceptable. The reason being online 'haters' tend to abuse their right to free speech such that it infringes upon the next person because they have the comfort of knowing that nobody will find put who they really are and confront them. By calling out users on the newspaper website and responding to their comment as the moderator of the comments, and actually suspending their accounts because of it can go a long way.
__label__noRel	Anonymity may also prevent people to explore ideas they feel are taboo and prevent them from seeking help. e.g. addiction, some LGBTQ+ issues that are taboo in certain cultures etc.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	I agree,that way people aren't bullied online.	Provide guidance on what is and isnt hate speech would work i think
__label__noRel	I agree!	In as much as we can not let the spread of hate speech continue, closing the comment section is not the solution. The newspaper website should have the option for readers to be able to report comments that include hate speech and moderators should be appointed to check "users" that are violating the rules. There can be filters in place that remove posts that have some of the common hateful and derogatory phrases. outlining the rules and regulations for the website users can help
__label__noRel	I agree most with this post, there's no reason to allow hate speech to exist on social platforms when it's so easy to moderate and control	We can start by encouraging people to debate and say their opinions to incite meaningful and helpful conversations and comments instead of hate and other harmful communication types
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	We need to let people have their opinions spoken. Removing the comment space is not a good option. Instead, we need to better educate people on what's good and what's bad.
__label__noRel	hateful opinions are not opinions	maybe make the comment section questions and answers about the article so comments are stictley moderated
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	You can moderate and that way delete hate speech. This won't get rid of freedom of speech but gets rid of discrimination etc https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech
__label__noRel	Would probably be very hard to actually do anything about people posting hateful comments	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	Moderation of the comments section
__label__noRel	means that people can read read articles without bias or preconceived opinions	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Comments are important as it can help create a balanced view and promote healthy discussion, maybe software could pick up on key words or phrases and then a moderator could look more in depth at questionable comments.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others.

__label__noRel	the algorithm could be abused by users	No-one should have to spend their time filtering out the disgusting things human beings are capable of saying about each other. Nobody has a right to comment on anything.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Moderation is key. Plenty of newspapers and online media are able to keep comments open with a bit of moderation.
__label__noRel	so	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	A perceived reputable source, but can have political leanings and opinions.	The way to fairly reduce hate speech is to use a mix of technology and human intervention to manage the potential volume of moderation required to provide a healthy environment for discussion. There are a number of tools available that allow for pre- and post-moderation to curb the worst excesses of user comments. This can be further enhanced by requiring readers to give a little more data about themselves to reduce the anonymity which provides a cloak for the potentially worst expressions of hatred.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	I agree slightly, it is good to see what others think unfiltered.	I know this has been discussed a few times potentially in reply to comments but I'd like to repeat it again: language is complex and you can't simply ban or flag certain terms or phrases and think you catch all the hate speech comments etc. While a report button and the use of a software that can support a human moderator is in essence a good idea, it might also delete comments that do not actually contain HS or completely miss others overall. I think this decision by the newspaper turned into an entire discussion of manageability of monitoring discussion sections and away from the ethical considerations.
__label__noRel	Certain words can be detected by the program which are hate speech and removed	Education in media ethics: The first step in combating tribalized hate speech is realizing that, while the right to free expression is a fundamental human right, the rise of social media has produced a number of different channels for its creation, packaging, and transmission. The rights and liberties of journalists and their role in fostering and developing peaceful societies should be emphasized in media ethics education. The political, social, and cultural rights of individuals and groups, including the freedom of expression, must be made more widely known, as well as the obligations and societal repercussions that come with press freedom. Journalists need to have the knowledge and abilities to spot hate speech and disseminate anti-hate messaging.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	Whatever the decision may be, the law and freedom of speech needs to be considered
__label__noRel	But are moderators available to this? And who agrees what can be said and what can't be?	I'm finding replying to comments here really awkward. As soon as I start typing the page moves, grrrr! However, I don't agree with vetting comments. I do agree with free speech, but not hate speech. People are entitled to an opinion without having to be nasty or a keyboard warrior. Moderating could be used to take out hateful comments, without taking away a well rounded debate, but where those lines are drawn is anyones guess!
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	i think people need to be educated better about what Hate Speech is.
__label__noRel	I agree with you on the fact the media controlling what we view can be untrustworthy and outright terrifying, however in the view of hate speech and affecting the health of authors and committed readers mentally factors in more greatly than this, in my personal opinion.	I strongly feel that comments are an essential part of the readers experience. It assists readers by giving them a broader sense and understanding of the topic being discussed. Removing them would be taking a way an integral part of that experience.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	Censoring speech prevents progress as a soceity. (https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2016/04/free-speech-important/)
__label__noRel	There are always cons in any idea	The best way to reduce hate speech would be to make sure that moderators are present to check on comments, it would not be advisable to cancel comments completely due the feedback it gives and people will always have their opinions and sometimes they will involve hate speech, which is unavoidable...
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	Newspaper comment spaces allow people the opportunity to share their opinions and feel that they can contribute their thoughts and ideas - it can also help readers engage with the content in a different way.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	I think there has to be a system that can verify whether a person's comment contains hate speech and if it is found to contain hate speech, that person should not be allowed to leave the comment.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	Awareness campaigns need to be implemented to teach people about the significance of avoiding hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree with Richard in so far as newspapers to this point mostly haven't had very successful moderating systems. Either they are unaware of current methods of spreading misinformation or they bring down the ban hammer so quickly that it makes their comments confusing	Once you are found commenting with hate speech, you should apologize
__label__noRel	I absolutely agree that people need to have an outlet to share their opinion, whatever that is. And the only reason to really turn comments off is where someone is seeking information, and have their answer/are satisfied with the response; but on a news site, I feel like blocking comments is a cop out for a controversial story, or to protect the sources feelings rather than giving the public a right to have a say.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I agree. However, policies that educate people on how to deliver their speech is imperative	the best way is for companies to filter hate speech and remove it as long as the criteria for hate speech comes from an independent organisation. If companies themselves govern what is hate speech then we would become subject to there rules which you would lose the point of freedom of speech. Also there should be more support in the community for people who are being targeted in hate speech attacks.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	I think that the website should develop a hate speech filtering software, to remove all offensive words that might be of hate speech.
__label__noRel	IT is absoluety the websites job to police polirising comments if nesccearry to keep peace wihthin the outiside community viewing their newspapers.	Make readers agree to not sharing hate speech and let them know that if they do, they will be blocked from commenting.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Use a BOT to regulate hateful comments
__label__noRel	I agree in principle to the idea of moderators, but in practice this can be a pretty blunt tool and quite labour intensive.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	there is need of moderators so people know they are being monitored and they can behave themselves also a filtering of swear words would help	The question is? Is hate speech not part of free speech? I think people should be left to express themselves however they feel is appropriate as long as they are not breaking an laws
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	We need to be very clear about what constitutes hate speech and create severe punishments for those that spread it.
__label__noRel	eliminating the comment section is more like taking peoples freedoms away as people have the right to freedom of expression	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	I agree	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	yes, I agree, need moderators,	Newspaper websites should use human or artificial intelligence-based moderators who can impartially identify hate speech and remove it from their platforms without removing or censoring genuine, constructive comments and perspectives. If AI is used, certain terms and phrases can be added to a database and comments containing them flagged for moderation to remove hate speech fairly.
__label__noRel	too many hate words	Censor out words
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	Newspaper websites should invest more in technology that can be used to detect hate speech and not allow it to be posted. They should only allow comments posted in the language that the software will understand so that it is able to eliminate hate speech without difficulties. they should also be willing to punish people who post hate speech by reporting them to the authorities.
__label__noRel	This is one of the most sane posts in this discussion. Thank you.	Completely removing the comment section is out of the question. How else is the audience supposed to interact with the material and each other? the feedback could be useful to the writer too for future articles pertaining to similar topics.
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	I agree that discussions should be moderated. But what happens when the moderators themselves are biased?
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	Freedom of speech is important - however hate speech is not important to debate
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	It is a tricky one to get the balance correct. There will always be some people in society who are happy to spout nonsense/hatred online as they sit behind a keyboard. At the same time, there will also be people who wish to share their more sensible and respectful views on topics.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	The best way to curb hate speech would be to have the comments section moderated for any forms of hate speech. In this manner people who have an opinion with substance can have a say in whatever article that was published.
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	Short answer is you can't, as the term 'hate speech' is incredibly vague, and can differ from person to person.

__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	readers comments be moderated and anything that is harmful, hateful or hurtful should be removed. this allows people to exercise their right of freedom of speech but limiting the harm that someones opinion may have
__label__noRel	They are a business and therefore hold the control over what is said in their comments.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	i agree with this. although i believe that freedom of speech and hate speech do not have a visible line. thus someone may be hiding behind the guise of freedom of speech but spewing hate rhetoric.	Hate speech is a form of self publicity. If the community isolates the perpetrators by flagging negative content that would be helpful. Flagged content would then need to be followed by banning perpetrators
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	It's a balance. There should be the ability to pre- and post-moderate comments. Pre- using technology to recognise potentially offensive words as well as closer moderation of articles on potentially controversial topics. Post-moderation to allow readers to report offensive topics which will be hidden from view until moderated.
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	There will always be a few bad apples in a batch just as there will always be bad people among humanity. Honestly the easiest method of combatting this issue is through the utilization of manual review teams perhaps hired by the newspaper or even paid through revenue made by the articles failing that approach bots can be instantiated with the programmed capability of removing comments that have flagged contents inside them.
__label__noRel	hate speech doesnt allways include certain hateful word so wont work in all cases	Use technology to monitor and block users
__label__noRel	Online would be a nicer place	You can reduce hate speech by moderating the comments, banning repeating offenders and requiring a phone number to create a account.
__label__noRel	It is a nice explanation	Removing the comment section should not be an option, we should not lose the right to freedom of speech based on the likelihood that a few may post hateful comments, strict moderation and being able to report hate speech is the solution. Having people sign up for platforms and use ID to which they could be held personally accountable is an option as well. Hate Speech often comes from being able to hide behind a keyboard, screen and a fake username.
__label__noRel	I agree	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	Don't think we should be censoring people	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	I think that fully blocking comments being allowed is detrimental to free speech, therefore comments should be allowed. However, there should be monitoring and banning of certain individuals if they are found to be continually hateful towards others.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	Block known accounts with a history of hate speech
__label__noRel	I agree that removing anonymity online can help to moderate behaviour.

__label__noRel	I agree	I think you could ban some words or have someone checking the comments and deleting the ones that are unappropiate, but limiting the whole comment section would be a mistake
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	Comment sections need to be well-moderated, and if algoritmic or user comment flagging is used this needs to also be reviewed by a human moderator to ensure that there is no bias or bad faith reporting going on.
__label__noRel	This will cause readers not to engage with the website or newspapers	it needs good moderating to weed out anything that could be described as hate speech
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	I kind of agree, but I think that organisations have a responsibility to put something in place to monitor their comment sections. Even if it's not an algorithm and it's an actual person instead! Although your link shows how difficult this would be for a huge organisation like FB.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	Personally I think it would require a well developed algorithm moderated by a team that updates it regularly to make sure it flags the correct material and continually updates it's database of words, phrases and dogwhistles

__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Hate comments are always not good for any person
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Having certain words being banned or marked as inappropriate might help reduce hate speech. Systems that moderate what is being said and shared and the option to report hate speech might be helpful.
__label__noRel	I think that would be unfair to other people who do not post hate speech.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

I'm a firm believer of freedom of speech therefore eliminating it in any form especially because of something that can be regulated like hate speech, to me is ridiculous.
__label__noRel	I agree, feelings should be left out when giving your views.	In as much as we can not let the spread of hate speech continue, closing the comment section is not the solution. The newspaper website should have the option for readers to be able to report comments that include hate speech and moderators should be appointed to check "users" that are violating the rules. There can be filters in place that remove posts that have some of the common hateful and derogatory phrases. outlining the rules and regulations for the website users can help
__label__noRel	but what if users arent using their real information, how can the goverment implement it then?	There is no discussion on free speech to have : free speech is absolute or not. If you don't like free speech then go live in China.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	I think filtering hate speech comments can do that and allowing a better more positive and a welcome experience to all readers.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words.

__label__noRel	one persons free speech is another persons hate speech	Newspapers and free speech functioned well for a couple of hundred years without instant comments. People used to write letters to the newspaper, including their name. The newspaper would then publish some letters anonymously. This meant that people were protected but offered well considered opinions, rather than abusive or nasty comments. Perhaps a slower postal system encourages better behaviour rather than an amplified Twitter-esque school-yard of bullying and abuse.
__label__noRel	It is great to ban them but they would create different profiles again to put out their comments. One good side of this idea is that they would consistently have to do extra work in creating new profiles to put out their hate speeches, and hopefully, one day they would be tired and give up.	We need to block the users that use hate speech and filter the comments that have any form of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform.

Removing the comment section all together is a fair point as news is meant to be fair and impartial. People share their opinions based on their biases and that's not what the news is for - that's what social media is for.

Removing the comment space from online newspapers is definitely not fair but I believe that it should be regulated by A-I. This way readers could share different opinions and thoughts abut the topic at hand without offending one another.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.

Systems like https://ground.news/ have been providing news and removing bias without a social aspect already and since third party social/sharing/commentary sites handle discussion and the problem of hate speech far better than newspaper websites presumably can hope to, the solution seems intuitive: remove it and let that happen organically on other websites and platforms.

I think that hate speech should be reduced through widescale education about the origins, hurts and trauma behind words which are used.

__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.

__label__noRel	This article also discusses the use of moderators https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation	I agree with some other opinions on the use of A1 to flag or censor certain words that constitute hate or violent speech. It would also be beneficial to have a human supervisor from the organisation and another external body review the activities of the AI to ensure accuracy and consistency.

__label__noRel	Taking away comments will mean a one sided news media and that is dangerous.	I believe that all types of hate speech should be removed.

__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	One cost-effective way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites while promoting reader comments is to outsource reader comments to social media. Comment sections can show comments for the article from social media platforms, while encouraging users to post comments onto these platforms. This way, hate speech can be reduced by social media platforms, which are more experienced with content moderation, have extensive rules in place, and have economies of scale with regard to content moderation compared to newspapers.
__label__noRel	It would save people wasting time leaving unecessary comments on often trivial matters. Its like people who ring up the radio, most people dont bother or care. Those who do are usually idiots or have more extreme opinions.	I think that definition of hatespeech needs to be laid out clearly as I think different people have different ideas on what constitutes hatespeech - perhaps if there was a kind of premediation that informs the user that what they are engaging in qualifies as hatespeech it may make them more likely to reconsider their messages introducing a form of self moderation as well as external moderation
__label__noRel	It is good to see alternative points of view presented on the page via reader comments. I think this can help to reduce the echo chamber phenomenon, particularly when readers cannot 'like' a comment.	One solution to reduce hate speech is by disabling the comment section altogether for most important topics/controversial topics. Yu can actually leave the comment section open for generic topics/non-contoversial topics.
__label__noRel	who gets to jugde what is allowed and whats not.	Not possible to to it completely, hate spech can be quite subtle. Needs real time moderation.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	By currating comments individualy in person upon reporting. Auto block certain words e.g N word
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	I think newspapers websites should introduce a bot that would delete automatically all posts that have too many hate words in it.
__label__noRel	I agree - ban certain words	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	It would certainly be effective as there's a team solely focused on that.	There is a careful balance to be made between protecting others from the effects of hate speech and protecting free speech. Online hate speech unfortunately can have the effect of increasing violence against minorities (https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons) but blocking all free speech because of the actions of a few seems like a poor decision. More must be done to remove hate speech online quickly and this means spending more money tackling it.
__label__noRel	Whilst I think that removing comments wouldn't fix hate speech, surely it would definitely diminish it and isn't that better than no solution at all?	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	very true	every comment submitted by readers must be checked internally for hate speech
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.

__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	appreciate people have different views
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	Using algorithms is a valid option for many things, but analyzing text is still quite difficult for computers. They're are not very good at detecting sarcasm or irony, for instance.	Before an opinion is published it must be moderated and if it contains hate speech then the writer will not be able to post it.
__label__noRel	true, but maybe they can remove anonymity so that everyone can be accountable for what they say.	One way I propose to prevent hate speech is to remove anonymity online. Not being able to hide should limit cowardly behavior and thus reduce harmful speech.
__label__noRel	This is a great idea as people can openly speak their opinions without worry of being attacked.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	I think that education with penalties such as exclusion from the community for repeated offences is the best policy. Like many I agree that some people are unaware they unaware they have caused offence to others.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	The comments could be examined for offensive language. For instance, there might be a robot that scans comments for offensive language and deletes them.
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	The words chosen to be used are very essential when in comes to the reader and a writer. The content that is viewed as a hate speech should not be shown to the other readers. It should automatically give a warning to the writer and after 3 warnings they should be blocked as they do not comply with the terms and conditions.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Discussion can be encouraged, but so often it leads to hate speech / one sided arguments. There needs to be a moderator in place to delete / hide certain comments, so free speech is allowed, but hate speech is not.

__label__noRel	it removes the right of freedom of speech	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	It has been normalised that the web is space for hate talk and privacy to say anything, but why did we make this the norm. If it's something you wouldn't say in person then don't say it at all.	It may be a good idea to involve some form of moderators to check if there are any hate speeches. Aggressive comments may be censored accordingly. However, we need to be careful in doing this as some may have negative effect as silencing voices.
__label__noRel	yes i agree with you, the comment section should remain open but people have to remember to be respecyful and consider other peoples emotions	the comment section should not be disabled as is it there for the readers to engage with the content uploaded so it makes no sense to close it, however there should be restrictions.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	I disagree with the stance of doing away with the comment section in its entirety, it goes against the premise of media which is to spark a debate or discussion.
__label__noRel	The fact we are discussing it with different responses is evidence of your point that it is a very difficult question to find a solution to.	This is not a black or white topic. The question is how exactly we define hate speech. Criticism in itself is not hate speech, but it is easy to take things to extremes, especially when someone expresses their opinion anonymously. Education about the reasons is important to better understand our own feelings and behaviour. Educate people do not restrict them!

__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	Nice. Your comment sums it up.

This is an interesting point - I wonder if some websites already use AI to moderate user comments and posts. I think AI could be trained to recognise hate speech, although it would have to be tested first as it could censor too much.
__label__noRel	I agree	I believe the comment section should be open to all to express their opinions.We need freedom of speech. Hate speech can be ignored. But it is important to show the view of all.
__label__noRel	very true	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	Just because something exists it doesn't mean it should be used in a way that it is abused.	Comment space encourages discussion of important topics and allows free exchange of information and so should not be eliminated. Independent moderators should be used in order to ensure that hate speech is quickly deleted and encourage users to express their ideas without using inappropriate or aggressive language.
__label__noRel	I would imagine that it would be difficult to filter out all of the hate speech	Reducing hate speech shouldn't be the focus. The problem lies in the reactions to it - in particular, giving the drastic perspectives too much attention. This attention only encourages more of the debate and problematic perspectives. Though total ignorance would also be unfair, so really we need a position of just LESS attention and care given to such perspectives.
__label__noRel	yes! This is exactly what i said	I would disagree richard, newspapers can often fuel hate speech through their phrasing and the way they choose to title their articles therefore it is down to them to avoid hate speech spreading on their websites.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	Algorithms are a must to cut out hate speech. Allowing only paying subscribers is elitist but necessary as being traceable is important.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	An improvement on this would be to have a flagged comment be reviewed by a moderator rather than just delete a comment altogether.	create a team of people that can look for and remove the hate speech and leave all other respectful arguments to make the comment section diverse.
__label__noRel	Agreed, this article shares the same views.

__label__noRel	Hate speech is not at all the same as valid criticism. And if freedon of speech is resulting in hate speech then I think it should indeed be policed and silenced	moderating the comments
__label__noRel	The issue at hand is not the total elimination of hate speech, but whether it can be reduced on newspaper websites. A newspaper must responsibly manage its public platform, and giving platform to hate speech is a problem it can manage. A newspaper is, by definition, not a forum.	most people seem to be of the opinion that cutting comments altogether is not constructive. A good point was made by an individual that viewing opinions from people you like only doesn't help you to grow (echo chamber).
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Hate-speech is part of free-speech, it's hard to focus on one without affecting the other so what should be done is to write articles differently, a neutral way where both sides can see themselves because we become less aggressive when we feel part of a group
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	I think you can put a price to the website- a subscription to readers.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	The key way to do it would be with very in-depth moderation which is non-biased and respects criticisms but its aware when a comment is taken too far and viewed as hate speech. the comment section should not be eliminated but mainly moderated and supervised
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?

People should be allowed to say what they want. Other people can disagree - they should not allow themselves to be angered by opinions with which they disagree.
__label__noRel	i agree with having to sign in to be able to comment.	There is a fine line between freedom of speech and hate. And hate can be interpreted differently for different people causing biased censorship.

It's a balance. There should be the ability to pre- and post-moderate comments.

There needs to be rules and regulations stating the type of comments that can be made about other people. There should also be verification of a persons identity everytime they make a comment so that is visible who the statement was made by. Newspaper articles should constantly ready and delete hate speech comment.
__label__noRel	I agree that providing ID could be a way to help with this.	The difficulty with reducing hate speech, is that it is everywhere. It cannot feasibly be reduced with human power, but rather requires a computer system. The difficulty with an electronic system, is that it inherently requires money and financing, and therefore is incentivised to make money. When money is in the equation; thoughts, politics and ideas can be easily manipulated by those funding the system
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Just pay moderators
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	Comment space encourages discussion of important topics and allows free exchange of information and so should not be eliminated. Independent moderators should be used in order to ensure that hate speech is quickly deleted and encourage users to express their ideas without using inappropriate or aggressive language.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	by giving guide lines on the comment section
__label__noRel	Disagree. I think that newspapers have always been allowed to 'sell' information, but news sites do so at their own risk by eliminating vast swaths of subscribers and advertisers. A good reliable newspaper is also the best long term business model	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	Go through and censor out certain words
__label__noRel	I Disagree, modern software technology is capable of knowing when to filter out post being made by the public. A system can be integrated as too where if a post achieves a certain threshold of flagged/reported tickets; there post would and can be immediately shut down.	Removing the comment section all together is a fair point as news is meant to be fair and impartial. People share their opinions based on their biases and that's not what the news is for - that's what social media is for. But in this case allowing the comment section to remain would be great if people would not abuse the power to share freely by sharing hate speech and slander. us as humans need to be regulated by a set of rules in order to keep a functioning society and i think a filtered comment section is the solution.
__label__noRel	not well explained	Provide a clear definition on what is considered hate speech and eliminate those comments that fit in that definition
__label__noRel	eliminating space for readers comments? is that the right approach?	by giving guide lines on the comment section
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	I think that things should be reviewed by a moderator, but it is a tough decision what is considered hate speech and what is someone's opinion.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	we need to stop coment section
__label__noRel	Protected classes can be addressed properly by preferred terms. Reduces fighting over "political" issues instead of the subject at hand	I feel that people should be allowed to have freedom of expression online but should be held accountable for vitriolic and unbased hate speech, this could be achieved by proving identity and by using citations and references when posting online
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	news media can look into AI technology to solve such problems.the machine will detect faul speeach and instantly hide or delete the comment ,then send a warning to the post writer
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	Block known accounts with a history of hate speech
__label__noRel	reasonable discussion and points	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	we could use bots the get triggered when certain words are used. The bot will therefore remove the comment andhold it until it has mannually reviewed by a human. Another option can be to allow the users to report comments from other users and if the reports reach a certain threshold then hold that comment for review.
__label__noRel	Protected classes can be addressed properly by preferred terms. Reduces fighting over "political" issues instead of the subject at hand	Have monitoring software be used. The comment section should not be removed, because it then deprives the general public of their opinion and freedom of speech as well as addressing any inaccuracies that were mentioned in articles.
__label__noRel	not focusing on the interconnection between free speech and hate crime	Hate speech is a problem but we do need to have debate. We need to respect different views and allow people to voice their opinion where necessary to further a debate on a news topic. Having the comments vetted before they appear does allow for some censorship but that must not be at the cost of open discussion.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	I agree. People will take their words to other platforms such as twitter and Instagram anyway, a comment section is perhaps not needed.	Agreeing with others here: a standard of moderation would have to be communicated to the user, with straightforward policies of flagging or reporting potentially hateful comments. A synthesis of live and algorithmic moderators might be best, as certain words can be auto-flagged for review, whereas other things might involve a more delicate touch.
__label__noRel	We need to distinguish between hate speech and political speech. Differences of opinions should not be classed as hate speech.	Hate speech is everywhere, not just in the newspaper
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	I think the best option would be to put some moderators that are educated about hateful speeches and let them see comments before they are online so that they can decide to approved them or not. They are doing it in Germany (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793)
__label__noRel	I agree	I agree that free speech should be honoured and upheld. That being said, newspapers are their own entities that should have autonomy over their interactions and comments from readers. Therefore, I think the use of moderators, filtering out certain offensive language, and strict and visible posting guidelines are good ways to reduce hate speech on these websites.
__label__noRel	Comment sections seem rather pointless anyway and are just usually vessels for people to argue. There's social media nowadays to weigh in on your opinion	https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3394231.3397902
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	More Admin and block buttons
__label__noRel	This puts the power in many people's hands	I think this is a task that is hard to do because it has to be done in a way that would not hinder freedom of speech but at the same time not attack people. Thus, I think comments should be flagged depending on the words used but not be deleted until it has been checked.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	by having it monitored and removing hate speech at source
__label__noRel	I agree. This could prevent uninformed comments which usually lead to hate speech.	I enjoy reading through comments and I don't think that they should be removed, but there should be a lot more monitoring going on to remove any hateful ones as soon as they are posted.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	I've gone over most opinions on this topic. The best solution would be a bot that would filter out the harmful comments
__label__noRel	Readers comments are an accountability tool for curation	Just don't write about it
__label__noRel	Internet education is definitely needed	Some hate speech is actually illegal, so that should definitely be reported and removed. https://www.report-it.org.uk/reporting_internet_hate_crime
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Awareness campaigns need to be implemented to teach people about the significance of avoiding hate speech.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	I believe it is fair for hate speech comments to be censored, because it could lead to violent public behavior. (read this: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech)	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Take a few minutes to breathe, meditate, and physically calm your body down before you start typing your response.
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	I think people should be able to express their feelings, but there should be a way to block hate speech
__label__noRel	Yes this is a sensible solution to this problem	have an AI to scan and analyse trigger words, then the alert is passed to a human reviewer then can say whether or not it's hate speech
__label__noRel	People will add their opinions anyway, whether they are necessary or not	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	This would require a special team to supervise the comment section at all times which might be costly.	Removing the comment section will not solve the problem. It will just create a filling of censorship and will make debate and dialogue vanish. It is important that people discuss news topics and also give feedback on those news to the newspaper. It is important to moderate this comments in a strict no hate speech way and bring accountability in. Eliminating comments will just hide a problem that needs to be fixed by moderating and educating people.
__label__noRel	I disagree with this to an extent, in order to have an open debate, both sides would have to be coming at the issue from a similarly open minded position, which realistically is not going to happen.	freedom speech is good but it assumes that common sense prevails too
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	An article proving AI can be helpful, but can struggle to interpret or detect certain things, suggesting manual reviewing is still very important. https://www.latrobe.edu.au/nest/can-combat-rise-online-hate-speech/ On another note, I also think anonymity plays a huge role in what people allow themselves to post online and think that certain platforms should consider only allowing people to comment under their own identity rather than online handles and such.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	what's the point in having comments at all if people are not allowed free speech?	By totally eliminating the comments section because most it kills reporters confidence and it may lead to hate speech and fake news
__label__noRel	I feel this really limits free speech. Speech should be free as long as it's not harmful. Not all comments are mean/come from bad intentions. Without having additional comments, there wouldn't be a richness of opinion in the news.	Completely removing the comment section is out of the question. How else is the audience supposed to interact with the material and each other? the feedback could be useful to the writer too for future articles pertaining to similar topics.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	I don't think algorithms are the answer. They need to be very, very sophisticated otherwise they require a human mediator.
__label__noRel	while free speech is our right and we are entitled to our own opinions, when you are promoting/endorsing hatred and discrimination of any sort, the line should be drawn. having a discussion/debate with opposing sides is normal and gives insight to both sides with little bias, but that cannot be used as an excuse to be hateful or discriminatory.	Some hate speech is actually illegal, so that should definitely be reported and removed. https://www.report-it.org.uk/reporting_internet_hate_crime
__label__noRel	no you cant control peoples behaviours but what you also cant control is peoples abilities to have an opinion. we all need to have a say, hence what twitter is full off .	One user by the name of AndreaP said in order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section Newspapers should be one sided providers. I strongly disagree with this argument. It is very autocratic and happens a lot in countries where media and citizens does not have freedom and oppressed by harsh leadership. Comments in newspapers help many to get raw information from the ground and open minds of many to see issues differently from differing opinions. Indeed comments section are necessary
__label__noRel	Th Un have argued that we need to address hate crime https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech	By using a tool to search for hate speech
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	Not allowing anonymous posts as well would force individuals to process comments internally before publishing on a public platform.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	Knowing the rules, unfortunately, doesn't mean that people respect them. There's a lot of hate speech on Facebook and a lot of it goes unnoticed.	However there is the potential to much greater exposure to it on online than in past times. Therefore I continue to believe that greater controls on those posting comments will decrease mindless hate speech and promote constructive debate.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	the newspapers should have an algorithm that can detect comments which go against the community guidelines and ban these accounts. Spam accounts should also be detected and banned if they do no contribute constructively to the newspapers.
__label__noRel	I can understand the reason why that might remove some of the problem, but that argument is a bit like saying, some roads frequently experience traffic jams, so let's get rid of all the cars. What's more important is the effective moderation of hate speech - and also crucially to call out mistruths. Discussions are the starting point.	Blocking words does not stop hate, what we need to do is have a filter that alerts a human so that a post. Posts/users should be identifiable to the platform they post on (not identifiable to the post but to the platform should any hate crime be identified)
__label__noRel	I think that is an excellent idea, perhaps using some form of AI could be used to cut down costs.	I kind of agree, but I think that organisations have a responsibility to put something in place to monitor their comment sections. Even if it's not an algorithm and it's an actual person instead! Although your link shows how difficult this would be for a huge organisation like FB.
__label__noRel	Facts	Having a screaning for all comments before they go up on the platform to make sure that they are not posted on the site.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	I think we could have a hold on comments until it is checked and fact checked by a panel of people! Not just one person making the decision. Also I think if there were stricter punishments for hate speech the newspaper would make the person and newspaper think twice.
__label__noRel	although I do think that, however, we should consider how many people do in fact post hateful comments without the protection of anonymity. look at Facebook, for instance - it's absolutely full of hate speech from people posting under their names using accounts that people can view and learn more about them. perhaps if people are truly hateful then being known for this isn't a problem for them after all.	Use technology to monitor and block users
__label__noRel	I don't think algorithm can accurately detect hate speech.	appreciate people have different views
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	I think comments should be limited and all negative comments should be blocked
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted.

__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	We do have to allow people to express their opinions - we can't pretend opinions don't exist. Having them out in the open lets us know what we're dealing with. But at the same time hate speech can't be allowed to flourish and absolutely needs to be challenged. There is a role for AI (which I have said before I know) to try and weed out and remove anything that is just pure hate and not any sort of coherent argument or opinion.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	By putting in a classing program that will read and class information as it enters. That way things will work nicely and we wont see more of hate speech
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words.

Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Make readers agree to not sharing hate speech and let them know that if they do, they will be blocked from commenting.
__label__noRel	Also it's not about restricting any form of hate speech, we also need to be reminded that our opinions can't be the only right one. Hate speech is hate, and a crime against who ever is being undermined	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	Asking for their constructive criticism and how it will benefit the individual and community.
__label__noRel	This definitely needs human input, it's too sensitive a matter for machines!	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	By moderating the comment section. Instead of having an individual who may be biased in their moderation, the use of an artificial intelligence software can be introduced to moderate the comment section.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	I also agree with this. This solution is a middle ground between two extremes.	I think that only people who provided identifying information can post their opinions. Also I agree that there should be AL tools to prevent hate speech. Eliminating hate speech from newspaper websites has nothing to do with the infringement of the free speech right.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?

Addressing hate speech does not mean limiting or prohibiting freedom of speech. It means keeping hate speech from escalating into something more dangerous, particularly incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence, which is prohibited under international law. https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Implementing a software that detects comments including hate speech, like the ones on social networks. Also including a report button for poeple to report hate speech comments
__label__noRel	It might lead to fake profiles	Hate-speech is part of free-speech, it's hard to focus on one without affecting the other so what should be done is to write articles differently, a neutral way where both sides can see themselves because we become less aggressive when we feel part of a group
__label__noRel	I agree with this, as the issue of moderating newspaper comments also crosses the gap into social media where most newspapers will post their articles too.	People who take part in hate speech should be dealt with lawfully so as its a form of cyber-bullying, that way less people will resort to hate speech

If someone writes a message, it should be checked before allowing it to be posted, it could be done by a simple program where the computer looks for offensive words.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	Every person should be traceable, so they are accountable. If your comments consist of hate speech or are offensive then you be accounable.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	the best way to address hate speech to make it clear to the viewers regarding the consequence of hate speech. Also, only individuals who have registered on the platform after providing their details can be allowed to comment. furthermore, new accounts must be placed on a probation period and cannot be allowed to comment on the same day that they are created.
__label__noRel	Agreed, there's needs to be stronger consequences for those sharing hate speech. Those behind accounts which troll and leave horrific content should be banned and the ip address blocked.	Limit anonymity in public discussions and employ a system of moderation.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	I still think a filtering system of removing categorically hateful words could help a little, but there is still the big problem of other comments bypassing that. I think an independant and unbiased moderation team could help to remove the issue of the newspapers removing valid critisism or comments about inaccurate reporting for example.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	By not providing comment section not unless the article need their opinion. There'll be a note notifying readers to be well mannered.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	Yes but it can also reduce the preaching of misinformation and hateful ideologies	Allow others users to rate the comments and block those who receive bad ratings
__label__noRel	its hard to find moderators without bias	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	hate sppech exists wheather in a comments section or not	It may be a good idea to involve some form of moderators to check if there are any hate speeches. Aggressive comments may be censored accordingly. However, we need to be careful in doing this as some may have negative effect as silencing voices.
__label__noRel	While I mostly agree, I question whether a newspaper's goal is engage in discussion. It would likely depend on the paper. Some print media is certainly for discussion.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	This will help the newspaper and community to know which areas affect people the most and help them	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I agree, these may seem tedious at first but they are necessary actions newspapers should consider.	By having an administrator who is able to monitor any comment posted, and removing hateful speech and giving warning to hateful viewers
__label__noRel	I agree with this	In today's world where technology has advanced to such a degree, I'm of the belief that creating parameters that protect individuals from any form of hate speech is very much possible through things such as AI. The removing of commenting sections could be argued as a violation to one's freedom of speech, it also means the views and opinions of the public will be lost which could have detrimental effects.
__label__noRel	the same as my idea	I enjoy reading through comments and I don't think that they should be removed, but there should be a lot more monitoring going on to remove any hateful ones as soon as they are posted.
__label__noRel	Beneficial to the masses.	Newspaper websites should also be held accountable if they do not deal with hate speech
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	I think filtering hate speech comments can do that and allowing a better more positive and a welcome experience to all readers.
__label__noRel	This would be a good idea in theory, but there is not enough man-power to do this. Who would fund these moderators?	Instead of removing the comment section newspapers can try and look up new and different ways to facilitate their reader engagement.
__label__noRel	Its not fair, I believe its best to leave comment bar available to everyone because freedom of speech is still and thing and some who practice hate speech might be educated by another. Instead of leting one person practice hate speech elsewhere its best discussed and dealt with there and then. Something hate speech happenes dure to lack of knowledge.	Asking people to identify themselves when doing their registration. If we remove the anonymous factor, people will be afraid to act like trolls.
__label__noRel	Correct	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	It really depends on what type of personal data is being shared. I strongly believe in privacy because people can be crazy.	Moderating comments is a far better method than eliminating comments entirely. I feel a method for reporting comments, though not perfect, is better, and then reported comments can be examined and removed if necessary.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Is it really hate speech or is it just an opinion that we don't want to hear?

__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	This is a good article in how to combat hate speech comments: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793
__label__noRel	That is a very minimalistic view as there could be many words that get missed and what happens if someone uses normal words that make a hateful sentence	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I don't think most people would take the time to educate each other about hate speech, and I assume there will be stubborn people that are stuck in their ways and will continue to comment their hateful opinions.	I think if all comments go under review for hate speech, that should still allow a chance for hate speech comments to be retracted
__label__noRel	Again, good point. Maybe there should be a daily limit on how many posts can be removed? (In order to avoid publishers becoming reliant on retrospective fixing, rather than their initial checks - which are where the problem originates).	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	I agree, as people need to be made aware that sometimes, what they say and think could offend other people.	Hate speech can be positive criticism and essential in some posts, altgough it can be offensive and totally uncalled for in other posts. A way in which social media apps regulate and monitor the comments, otherwise people have rights to freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	By blocking comments with offensive words related to the topic, and banning individuals who constantly engage in hate speech.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Whatever the decision may be, the law and freedom of speech needs to be considered
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	it needs good moderating to weed out anything that could be described as hate speech
__label__noRel	I agree, the comment section should likely remain but be heavily moderated and regulated to disallow hate speech as the article above says	I would almost agree that removing the comments would be beneficial. I've very rarely seen a comment on an article that actually contributed towards learning more about the content. It's typically just people yelling they don't agree without any true thought.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	i agree that we still need readers comments but they should be filtered.	I don't think it's helpful to cancel the comment space completely, we should have the ability to post our thoughts.

__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others.

__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	Having read all of the previous discussion surrounding this debate, I still stand by my original opinion. Moderating comments by an official representative of the newspaper doesn't allow for free speech. We do however, need to eliminate hate speech. I think the best way to do this is to put this in the hands of the community and other readers.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it.

__label__noRel	I agree with the idea that anonymity on the Internet often has the consequence to make it easier for people to harass / be horrible to each others.	This is a win or loose situation.

__label__noRel	Under current laws, restauranters are responsible for hate speech among their diners, so I certainly think platform owners should be responsible for the presence of hate speech on their websites. Hate speech is a criminal offence, after all.	Despite my defence of human moderators, it seems they too are flawed -- check out this article https://www.technologynetworks.com/informatics/news/ai-trusted-as-much-as-humans-to-flag-hate-speech-365777 -- human moderators are not only prone to bias but also impractical. With the huge wealth of content posted every second online, it is unrealistic to expect humans to be able to view, criticise, and moderate every single comment.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	It is easy to be hateful online when you are anonymous. Before being able to comment on newspaper websites, users should be required to sign up using traceable methods (eg. some form of identification). The comment section should regularly be monitored and any users who post hate speech should face serious consiquences
__label__noRel	I agree. A big importance for newspapers is the comment section and people's opinion to what they have written.

__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	I would disagree richard, newspapers can often fuel hate speech through their phrasing and the way they choose to title their articles therefore it is down to them to avoid hate speech spreading on their websites.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	Hate speech is something is completely unacceptable and should be eradicated by all means necessary however regulations are our best bet if we are to maintain freedom of speech at the same time.

__label__noRel	I agree, there are currently no online hate speech statistics available due to a lack of means to report hate speech: https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/what-is-online-hate-crime/	I think that keeping an open space for discussion is vital and needed. Strick and easy to understand rules should be there and a group of moderators implementing them as well. We should do more about educating on media ethics, keeping freedom of expression should be combined with counteracting hate speech messages.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.

__label__noRel	I agree with this however sometimes 'hate speech' can be subjective between different people. You have your clear and obvious examples of hate and some comments can be up for opinion	I believe if we can be on the same page and let the media tell the story the truth with out lashing out on it.
__label__noRel	very true	The best way to curb hate speech would be to have the comments section moderated for any forms of hate speech. In this manner people who have an opinion with substance can have a say in whatever article that was published.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	I think we firstly have to call out hate speech in order for people to learn that it is not okay and unacceptable. The reason being online 'haters' tend to abuse their right to free speech such that it infringes upon the next person because they have the comfort of knowing that nobody will find put who they really are and confront them. By calling out users on the newspaper website and responding to their comment as the moderator of the comments, and actually suspending their accounts because of it can go a long way.
__label__noRel	yes eliminate them and stop all comments that could offend people	You can let people create an account with a full name so they will have to think more about what they write and can't so easily spew hate
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	I know this has been discussed a few times potentially in reply to comments but I'd like to repeat it again: language is complex and you can't simply ban or flag certain terms or phrases and think you catch all the hate speech comments etc. While a report button and the use of a software that can support a human moderator is in essence a good idea, it might also delete comments that do not actually contain HS or completely miss others overall. I think this decision by the newspaper turned into an entire discussion of manageability of monitoring discussion sections and away from the ethical considerations.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	By making people aware that hate speech is not good by creating awareness campaigns against hate specch.
__label__noRel	That would reduce hate speech	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	agreed	I think that a comment section is necessary for engagement and exchange of ideas but having said that, there should be a code for AI embedded within that platform which will be able to detect hate speech or words classified as hate speech then the AI can delete them automatically. Also people can report the comment and the AI should delete the comment within minutes of it being reported.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	Hate speech does more harm than good
__label__noRel	When your beliefs are entwined with your identity, changing your mind means changing your identity. That’s really hard for most people.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	There's other spaces for online discussion (eg Reddit or Facebook). Newspapers seem to only have online comments sections in order to capture readers and keep them on their site.	People tend to comment just to rile others up, which means it will be a lot of work to moderate. Perhaps an all or nothing approach is best.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	I don't believe removing the comment section will help remove hate speech, but having a system that can track the device and the people that use that device can go a long way in removing trolls from a community platform and prevent them from becoming repeat offenders.
__label__noRel	I agree, everyone has the right to their opinion and to express it	By a combination of monitoring and blocking people who leave such comments, and also having suitable laws in place to back this up
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	Community moderation is used on many platforms to allow discussion whilst preventing hate speech from arising, however this is greatly dependent on human participation which can take a lot of work depending on the size of the community. Additionally, the removal of hateful comments can better a comment section, but will not change a commenters views- this has led to the development of more insular online communities fostering these more extreme or hateful views. People will create a space for their commentary if there isn't one provided (or if their comments are removed from somewhere). A lot of this comes down to what a given newspaper wants to be associated with (in the sense of their brand) as opposed to maintaining the sanctity of online discussion.
__label__noRel	Yes, it is a very difficult balance and trying to find mechanisms that are fair and balanced to control these are basically impossible to find.	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	I think we need to develop a way to recognize hate speech in comments so that it is easy to monitor comment sections for derogatory and offensive language. There are studies on how to go about this for example if you follow this link it talks about "A Feature-Based Approach to Assess Hate Speech in User Comments" https://www.cairn.info/revue-questions-de-communication-2020-2-page-529.htm
__label__noRel	i think this is correct but i do feel that there is more that technology can do to help these days too	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	The main question is how to determine what is considered as discrimination or violence. Opposing arguments can be flagged as discrimination or violense.	Have something that sensors specific hate words and filter them out
__label__noRel	People are entitled to an opinion that isn't hateful or intended to harm a person.	This is an interesting point - I wonder if some websites already use AI to moderate user comments and posts. I think AI could be trained to recognise hate speech, although it would have to be tested first as it could censor too much.
__label__noRel	Whilst I agree, not when people are spewing hate and creating a hateful echo chamber.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	Comments would need to be approved before being posted.	people feel powerful behind an anonymous account, its easier to say things you would never normally say under the guise of anonymity, if it was easier to link a comment to who it came from and if people actually faced consequences from posting hate then this could help stop it.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	I agree with some other opinions on the use of A1 to flag or censor certain words that constitute hate or violent speech. It would also be beneficial to have a human supervisor from the organisation and another external body review the activities of the AI to ensure accuracy and consistency.
__label__noRel	I agree	The use of admins and moderators can be helpful in removing hate speech. They would need strict rules for the public in order to not let their own personal biases judge what is and isn't considered hate speech.
__label__noRel	They'd be less incentivised to start any speech. Who would agree to giving copious amounts of personal data to some faceless online entity just to make a comment?	By moderating the comment section. Instead of having an individual who may be biased in their moderation, the use of an artificial intelligence software can be introduced to moderate the comment section.
__label__noRel	It would also not allow the writer to see if the public like what he/she is writing.	we could use bots the get triggered when certain words are used. The bot will therefore remove the comment andhold it until it has mannually reviewed by a human. Another option can be to allow the users to report comments from other users and if the reports reach a certain threshold then hold that comment for review.
__label__noRel	That is actually a good idea, but gives a lot of power to the moderators.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	Good for open mindedness.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	If comments are present they should not be regulated. People should not allow themselves to be personally offended by the opinions of others. People have a right to their own beliefs and opinions.	I think that someone should be assigned as a moderator who assesses comments before they are posted to ensure they don't contain any offensive information
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	Reducing hate speech shouldn't be the focus. The problem lies in the reactions to it - in particular, giving the drastic perspectives too much attention. This attention only encourages more of the debate and problematic perspectives. Though total ignorance would also be unfair, so really we need a position of just LESS attention and care given to such perspectives.
__label__noRel	we can't trust people to follow standards	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	i agree that removing comments about hate speech is not the way to go
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	Alternatively I'd offer the opinion that goes against the question and states that we shouldn't offer a space for readers comments (and thus hate speech) at all on news since it's primarily a site and source for news. Systems like https://ground.news/ have been providing news and removing bias without a social aspect already and since third party social/sharing/commentary sites handle discussion and the problem of hate speech far better than newspaper websites presumably can hope to, the solution seems intuitive: remove it and let that happen organically on other websites and platforms.
__label__noRel	Training AI to do that would be a great way to prevent this phenomen	Hate speech can be positive criticism and essential in some posts, altgough it can be offensive and totally uncalled for in other posts. A way in which social media apps regulate and monitor the comments, otherwise people have rights to freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	By moderating the comment section. Instead of having an individual who may be biased in their moderation, the use of an artificial intelligence software can be introduced to moderate the comment section.
__label__noRel	I agree	Just pay moderators
__label__noRel	This could work	One way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for reader comments would to have active community managers who are activetly managing the comment section. Making sure that all comments are in accordance to the community guidelines.
__label__noRel	I agree, there is a certain level in which the elimination of hate speech overrules the need for comments	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	I think newspapers websites should introduce a bot that would delete automatically all posts that have too many hate words in it.
__label__noRel	Comments should add to the article though and the commenters often go down a facebook-style rant about something not helpful or relevant, I don't think this is the right space for this	We live in a democratic society and so people have the right to their opinions. They just need to be voiced in the right way
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	One way I propose to prevent hate speech is to remove anonymity online. Not being able to hide should limit cowardly behavior and thus reduce harmful speech.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	Maybe filter through comments
__label__noRel	Its not fair, I believe its best to leave comment bar available to everyone because freedom of speech is still and thing and some who practice hate speech might be educated by another. Instead of leting one person practice hate speech elsewhere its best discussed and dealt with there and then. Something hate speech happenes dure to lack of knowledge.	Moderation is necessary. Closing comments is not the answer, as communication can help people to understand each other's viewpoints. If you take comments away because you're afraid of hate speech, you're going to be creating a barrier between you and your audience.
__label__noRel	Newspapers role is already to sell information, censorship can be done without doing comments with hate speech.	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	Self-opinion is illogical at times, but people are entitled to whatever non-harmful opinions they like. Except in the case of psychics and other charlatans.	you should autoban key hate speech words
__label__noRel	yes, the lack of consequences is the problem. We can see from somewhere like facebook where peoples info is so easy to find that people have had negative consequences over their hateful posts so clearly being able to link back the comment to the person can help	the fairly way of reducing hate speech from newspapers website is not allowing anyone to comment that is to bloc the comment section.
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	Have them reviewed after they are posted and do not allow them to be viewed before they are revied, as well as keeping tabs on the user posting the comments.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	I think the best way is to block or censor certain words. Especially words that are synonymous with hate speech. Or better yet, have moderators in comments sections.
__label__noRel	Less people will be willing to pay.	This is a win or loose situation. People will still continue with their comments even if it is not on the newspapers website. A person can take a screenshot of the topic and then twit it on twitter and then people will give their different opinions. The newspaper can still allow for readers comment however, the hate speech comments can be filtered. This is a democratic world and people have a right to have an opinion in what becomes available to them
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Certain hateful words/phrases could be blocked or they could introduce a reporting option in the comments section.
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	Stop calling it hate speech maybe it is just another opinion
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	by just making the section smaller and have trasparency with dooing so
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	People can express them selves however they like but they must be mindful to their language.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	More emphasis on moderation of specific language would reduce the risk of hate speech. Also, moderators approving comments before they appear on the website would help.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	the comment section should be set in a way that filters certain words that promote hate speech
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way.

__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	This article made me reflect on the definition of hate speech and I aggree with blocking comments that go against a persons protected characteristics - if a comment like that is made, it should instantly be banned from the platform / comment section. https://about.fb.com/news/2017/06/hard-questions-hate-speech/
__label__noRel	Free speech should never be curtailed. But how due you suggest you address the root cause of the problem?	https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3394231.3397902
__label__noRel	They might sift a bit	I'm of the supporting view that the use of AI to filter out Hate speech could prove to be very useful
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	Algorithms are a must to cut out hate speech. Allowing only paying subscribers is elitist but necessary as being traceable is important.
__label__noRel	AI may also let hate speech slip through the cracks.	the comments with hate speech can be remove. and the commenter should be ban for a period of time
__label__noRel	Hunting people down for their opinions is too much like big brother/censorship!	the comments with hate speech can be remove. and the commenter should be ban for a period of time
__label__noRel	That could help, although that would take a long of time. Also at the end of the day, whoever writes hateful speech do not see the dangers of what they are doing. According to an article in The Guardian, some people think this is just the internet and it does not reflect true life.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	I enjoy reading through comments and I don't think that they should be removed, but there should be a lot more monitoring going on to remove any hateful ones as soon as they are posted.
__label__noRel	I would like to be able to see why this comment was removed.	The comments could be checked for hateful speech. For example, there could be a bot or something (I do not know the exact name) that checks for any hateful words and eliminate that comment.
__label__noRel	Right to free speech isn't necessarily a right to a platform or a publisher. Before the internet, people weren't entitled to have their comments on the news stapled inside a copy of the paper. They were just able to express their opinions on it independently, to family or coworkers, or by writing their own publication in response. I'm not sure if newspapers simply choosing not to publish readers' comments (which is what they are doing by hosting those comments on their site) is the same as censoring free speech. By this logic, anyone who writes a poorly written opinion piece and submits it to the New York Times should get it published, because otherwise their speech is oppressed.	1st position: comments on newspaper articles should not be allowed
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender.

The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	A combination of a warning system, detailing what might be considered hate speech and a manual review if potential hate speech is detected as well as on manual reports (allowing brief descriptions for reasons for reporting) seems like a good way to go about it. People who have a history of posting more than one hate comment on the platform should be moderated each time before their comment gets publicised whether it's detected as hate speech by the algorithm or not. They would lose the privilege of being able to comment instantly without review.
__label__noRel	It is nice to read things you agree with, and proabaly helps sell newspapers	I am proposing the use of AI to manage this space
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	It is not fair if newspapers take away the comment space. I do not consider this to be fair choice in a supposed democratic society/
__label__noRel	People can have constructive debates and confront serious issues without using hate speech. Filtering hate speech will not stop debates.	In summary, I think we should not remove comment sections. We need to "teach" AI to filter the comment section on newspaper websites. In that way, we can add or remove filters, and AI will simply do the work of making sure the comment section is appropriate. People should not get involved to directly filter comments, they may not be fair at all.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Newspapers and free speech functioned well for a couple of hundred years without instant comments. People used to write letters to the newspaper, including their name. The newspaper would then publish some letters anonymously. This meant that people were protected but offered well considered opinions, rather than abusive or nasty comments. Perhaps a slower postal system encourages better behaviour rather than an amplified Twitter-esque school-yard of bullying and abuse.
__label__noRel	The problem is that hate speech can esculate and end up working against the newspaper's interest. People don't want to spend time in a fully toxic environment.	Reduce the anonymity that hate-speech writers can hide behind - without that shield some may be less inclined to post because it can be traced back to them
__label__noRel	Absolutely agree with you;removing the comments section will achieve nothing as it will drown out even sound contributions to the discussion(s).	ADD A HATE SPEECH DETECTOR
__label__noRel	I tend to agree with this as the problem of entrenched ideas is increased with the echo chamber approach to collecting infrmation	The algorithm should have code that detects certain hate speech words and shadow bans them so as they do not appear on the site. with a warning that it will happen if the post is posted.

__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others.

__label__noRel	The problem is some form of censorship would be required for writers if the definition of "hate speech" isn't universally agreed. Perhaps a trigger warning for readers of a sensitive disposition could be given at the start of an article. Different countries have different laws or understandings of hate speech. Will comments from different countries have to be blocked?	By having stricter controls over who can sign up to the comments and blocking them from the sites when they use hate speech. It's unfortunate that it happens, but sometimes they are loud just to get attention. Starve them of it.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Some of the comment section of some newspaper articles are not worth reading and may sometimes spoil the reading experience. https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.

__label__noRel	THE FREEDOM OF COMMENTING MUST COME WITH A RESPONSIBILITY NOT INFRINGING OTHERS INCLUDING HATE SPEECH	The only way to combat hate speech is through open debate. Restricting any form of speech (even hate speech) could lead to hateful views becoming unchallenged and potentially result in violence. There is also the issue that newspapers could define hate speech as certain comments they don't like destroying any potential for open debate. By maintaining open debate hate speech can be called out and as a result, become less frequent.

I think people should be left to express themselves however they feel is appropriate as long as they are not breaking an laws
__label__noRel	Agree- though there should also be some information provided as to why a comment has been deleted. For example, if someone uses a racial slur, they could be educated on why others may find it offensive. Rather than just blocking the comment.	you can add an AI system in the website that will scan all comments instantly after they have been posted and it can remove any hate speech before it is seen by many people on the comment section, this method is used by some online communication platforms.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	Regardless of whether stories need opinions added to them, people will do it anyway	I think the best option would be to put some moderators that are educated about hateful speeches and let them see comments before they are online so that they can decide to approved them or not.

__label__noRel	i dont believe eliminating the space for readers comments is the right thing, readers should be allowed to comment and moderators can be used to reduce harmful/hateful speech	Personally I think it would require a well developed algorithm moderated by a team that updates it regularly to make sure it flags the correct material and continually updates it's database of words, phrases and dogwhistles
__label__noRel	i agree because some people may not be educated on certain topics, and therefore not realize that they are promoting hate speech	In summary, I think we should not remove comment sections. We need to "teach" AI to filter the comment section on newspaper websites. In that way, we can add or remove filters, and AI will simply do the work of making sure the comment section is appropriate. People should not get involved to directly filter comments, they may not be fair at all.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	By putting in a classing program that will read and class information as it enters. That way things will work nicely and we wont see more of hate speech
__label__noRel	In a fast moving comments section with lots of commentators it would be impossible to moderate in real time.	Hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by educating people about the consequences of hate speech and what they can do to someone else.
__label__noRel	AI is a great option that would reduce the need for manpower and increase the efficiency and speed in which hate speech is addressed.	The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is often used as a reason not to have readers comments. It seems that this is not a fair argument for eliminating readers comments because of the psychological phenomenon of "cognitive dissonance" - we automatically search for echo chambers in any context.
__label__noRel	I definitely agree on the part of sciencing valid criticism	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	IT is absoluety the websites job to police polirising comments if nesccearry to keep peace wihthin the outiside community viewing their newspapers.	have an admin or moderator remove inappropriate comments.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Charactertisation of hate speech should be done case-by-case, rather than applied universally
__label__noRel	newspapers are meant to inform, not to be discussed. The comment section is not necessary.	If we are to ban everyone who post a hateful comment we would be infringing on their basic right of freedom of speech. But the question still remains, when is it just a hateful comment and not hatred or propaganda. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression in press and other media. To some extent we dont have a right to block them from expressing their thoughts
__label__noRel	Requires a lot of moderation	Censoring speech prevents progress as a soceity. (https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2016/04/free-speech-important/)
__label__noRel	Hate speech is problematic. But I also think that it is not the newspapers' role to host a forum for comments. I understand that this is just moving the problem to other social media platforms, but I think journalists have better to do than spend their time moderating comments...	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	yes so that people can say their views	Comment sections need to be well-moderated, and if algoritmic or user comment flagging is used this needs to also be reviewed by a human moderator to ensure that there is no bias or bad faith reporting going on.
__label__noRel	i believe there is no cons at all	There is a careful balance to be made between protecting others from the effects of hate speech and protecting free speech. Online hate speech unfortunately can have the effect of increasing violence against minorities (https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons) but blocking all free speech because of the actions of a few seems like a poor decision. More must be done to remove hate speech online quickly and this means spending more money tackling it.
__label__noRel	Define aggressive, some reddit subs ban gendered language which is over moderation in my opinion when you look at the content of a word not the technical definition of it sometimes. Like saying "I'm having a bitch of a time" vs "you're a bitch".	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Everyone shoould be able to express their own ideas but we could have some kind of protection in words the should not be allowed and also have a way to keep moderators on the website, people could be warned that they are doing something wrong and be explained that there IS NO HATE SPEECH and be offered maybe some way to express herself without hurting or damaging others.
__label__noRel	Hate speech should not be tolerated and is a misuse of freedom of speech toward a goal that does not serve to benefit anyone	I think that fully blocking comments being allowed is detrimental to free speech, therefore comments should be allowed. However, there should be monitoring and banning of certain individuals if they are found to be continually hateful towards others.
__label__noRel	This view takes away users ability to interact. This also allows for bias online.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	I agree that human moderators are necessary to reduce hate speech. However, I am concerned that not all websites may have the necessary financial and staffing resources to implement human moderation. I like that submitting personal information is necessary as a cost-effective means to reduce hate speech. However, I hope that the personal information will be verified, and the information will be used to promote change rather than to punish individuals. In this regard, laws may be necessary to protect online commentators.	I think removing the comment space is just avoiding the problem. There can be interesting and thoughtful comments and we would miss from them. Newspapers websites should instead try to regulate the comment space by introducing a bot or hiring appropriate moderators or there should be some punishment to discourage the use of hate speech.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	The technical team of the newspaper should select comments that don't promote hate speech and make those comments the only ones that are going to appear on the newspaper's websites.
__label__noRel	I agree. So many crimes/acts of violence in the real world have begun as online comments. It is certainly an important topic to discuss and find the right solutio n for.	read though the comments and only put on the comments with the less hate speech on
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	I think you could ban some words or have someone checking the comments and deleting the ones that are unappropiate, but limiting the whole comment section would be a mistake
__label__noRel	This would set the tone on the level of maturity that is required for the targeted group.	Awareness campaigns need to be implemented to teach people about the significance of avoiding hate speech.
__label__noRel	The problem is hate speech really means political speech. It's a way of silencing dissent of political agendas that are transforming certain countries societies in a way people don't like.	I have found that as well as reading the articles from newspapers, I have also been paying keen attention to the comments section of the article. Either on the newspaper site or on social media. I find that while the opinions of the article presens the views and research of the author, the comments offer an alternative viewpoint and opinions. A chance to see if the article hit the right note, and an opportunity to understand positives and negatives of a topic raised.
__label__noRel	Such algorithms can be completely customized. For example: any posts containing a list of any key words can be prevented from posting.	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	The newspapers will not get to know how people realy feel about the issue at hand if the comment space is closed. The dialogue will be one sided	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	hate speech revolves around certain words or slurs so if those word can be banned or even not allowed and the comment does not show up on the actual site it will help curb hate speech
__label__noRel	Disagree, there are ways to reduce hate speech, but they need to be implemented correctly.	Have them reviewed after they are posted and do not allow them to be viewed before they are revied, as well as keeping tabs on the user posting the comments.
__label__noRel	Yes there should be	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	i agree with this comment,	they need to as often it is minorities which are affected
__label__noRel	Stops the bullying and people feeling bad	Someone should monitor the chat, and those who use hate speech should be given 1 warning before being removed from the website.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	It is true that it would be difficult to remove and control all of the comments however i think it would be a lot more damaging to remove the right to freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I agree on the usefulness of a report button.	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	Hate speech is complex and jubjective. AI is still developing and not good enough to understand basic debate let alone interpret language, Too easy for AI to take words out of context.	I agree with this position since when providing personal data people would be less incentivized to starting hate speach
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	There should be moderators of the discussion, people who use hate speech should be informed of what is problematic about their comments, comments should be deleted or they might be hidden but you can open them and read the moderators comments. If educating is not helping after first attempt, person should be restrcited form further discussion.
__label__noRel	It will be difficult to establish the standards for which you regulate people - other than blocking obvious words	everyone should be entitled to comment and have opinions but the comment section should be checked and hate comments deleted and that user blocked on the website
__label__noRel	A similar tool is being used for music, to identify if it's DMCA free or not, if the music is commercial they ban your account online. Same thing should happen with hate speech. Scan the online media for bad words, specifics and then remove the comments all together.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	Posistive for who? One of the reasons for comment section is to promote socialising amongst readers not just or the newspaper itself	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	Maybe just turn the comments off what are obviously polarising matters.	By outright banning IP addresses which contribute hate speech to platforms, and investing in moderation through human resources and through text analysis tools.
__label__noRel	That is actually a good idea, but gives a lot of power to the moderators.	Debate should be available upon all topics. To reduce this availability reduces the opportunities for people to express their opinions and undermines democratic processes. Hate speech should be managed and eliminated before publication.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	as long as good moderators are in place, hate speech and disrespectful comments will be weeded out.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	Removing the comment section should not be an option, we should not lose the right to freedom of speech based on the likelihood that a few may post hateful comments, strict moderation and being able to report hate speech is the solution. Having people sign up for platforms and use ID to which they could be held personally accountable is an option as well. Hate Speech often comes from being able to hide behind a keyboard, screen and a fake username.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	One mainstream way of mitigating hate speech on online comment sections is to pre-moderate comments. This however may lead to a 'biased' viewpoint. A lighter example of this could be how some youtubers delete constructive criticism.
__label__noRel	IT is absoluety the websites job to police polirising comments if nesccearry to keep peace wihthin the outiside community viewing their newspapers.	appreciate people have different views
__label__noRel	I agree	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.

__label__noRel	Even with human moderators it still comes down to personal preference. There is no person alive who doesn't have ANY biases. what one human moderator might deem acceptable language another might not. Therefore, even human moderation isn't 100% accurate and failsafe.	checking the comments before allow the user to post it
__label__noRel	Human bias would still be at the very core of this moderation, but then again humans build algorithims too.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	comments should be moderated but we cannot remove all the negative and leave the positive comments. it would look like the newspaper is being biased
__label__noRel	Completely agree - there's a lot of evidence out there to support this https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	It is a good idea to not completely remove comment sections as that discourages user interaction	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed.

Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	Hate speech is already defined in law in many countries. As its already a criminal offence , the existing legislation provides the definition of hate speech, and blueprint to follow.	I believe the fairest way is the hardest way and that's to have a small group of people moderating REAL hate speech and spam. If someone wants to just use a racist term or promote their website, then these people's comment should be removed and they should be banned from commenting for a period of time. The idea to remove comments entirely is absurd as the news is not trustworthy enough to be the sole voice people hear. We need to hear other voices.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Where is the evidence for this? There is no guarantee that people will give correct credentials. Also, who defines 'hate speech'? This is not as simple as you may believe.
__label__noRel	I don't really think that any of the posts above really do touch the matter of this one so I can't really think of anything else to my argument here. (Evaluation as asked)	create an algorithm that identifies hate speech and removes it
__label__noRel	I like this idea, I hope everyone is able to be respectful to each other but unfortunately this is not always the case	I believe removing the comment section is not a solution and that it actually encourages hate speech
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	A rounded view of a topic. Ensure that their is a balanced opinion around newspapers. And also offers a check and balance--the public opinion is heard and known around issue raised.

__label__noRel	If you only hear things you agree with how can you grow and develop as well as develop your position so that it is defensible when its challenged	Most people tend to respond aggressively when they know that they are anonymous because they think that they cannot be held accountable for their actions (https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-24373-001)
__label__noRel	Less people will be willing to pay.	I think by blocking certain terms that are hateful when responding to others in comments i.e., you are an idiot, loser etc. Hate speech should not be present online.
__label__noRel	Not all opinions can be respected, especially those that violate other people's rights and identities.	I'm a firm supporter of freedom of speech but the internet as we all know can be a cruel place. A lot of individuals hide behind their screens and say things to people that they wouldn't have the guts to say in person given the opportunity. So with that being said I stand for the elimination of the space bar for readers.
__label__noRel	That would reduce hate speech	You should be allowed to give your opinion to express your view about a news article. To moderate this or to filter what you can and cannot say would it stop it from being free speech. What really needs to be looked at is to see how you can stop online trolling which I think is the root cause of some of these comment sections become so toxic. But for the media who is so depended on free speech themselves so that they can report on news in an unbiased way to eliminate the comment space is almost hypocritical. Just a weird idea here but perhaps you should do a quick test or verification before you can comment. A lot of people would not go through the effort of completing this if they just want to spread hate.

__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	I think the first step to reducing hate speech in readers comments should be in the form of a moderation team in which they filter inappropriate comments. I think it should be a group of people rather than AI to do this to ensure all hate speech within a variety of contexts are eliminated, as if this was done by a computer there is risk of hate spilling through. For example, hate speech on the social media platform Twitter can often be missed as users purposefully misspell hateful speech to ensure it does not flag up on the AI searches, going as far as hateful language misspelt actually trending on Twitter.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	Newspapers could censor certain words that are deemed hateful. This could be done automatically.
__label__noRel	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button	The pros of removing comment sections would be to eradicate the spreadof hate speech. Certain individuals thrive on adding fuel to fire. In this case having the comment section deleted would be a positive thing. On the other hand only by having differing opinions can discussions and debates happen. So if someone spews hate speech only then can we see the extent to which someone disagrees with a certain group/viewpoint etc. https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea

__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	We should have a clear definition for hate speech in order to regulate the comment section. For example, comments suggesting certain groups be harmed or should not exist, and language that suggests these groups are inferior without providing educational evidence. We need to keep the comment section a place of discussion and education.
__label__noRel	I agree with this, or some coding introduced in the background somehow to not even allow bad comments/words to be posted at all.

__label__noRel	Freedom of speech	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree it is an individual's responsiblity to choose their words carefully, and if they don't then their comments, or eventually if they persist, their accounts should be removed.	the fairly way of reducing hate speech from newspapers website is not allowing anyone to comment that is to bloc the comment section.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it.

__label__noRel	i think more moderators are needed for this - and i don't think it means we live in a nanny state as i'm sure others will say.	I think that someone should be assigned as a moderator who assesses comments before they are posted to ensure they don't contain any offensive information
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	https://en.unesco.org/5-ways-to-counter-hate-speech
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3394231.3397902
__label__noRel	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button	We can reduce hate speech by holding the owner of the platform accountable for hate speech being on their platform, this will force the platform owners to put strict systems in place to ensure this does not occur.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	I think this is a task that is hard to do because it has to be done in a way that would not hinder freedom of speech but at the same time not attack people. Thus, I think comments should be flagged depending on the words used but not be deleted until it has been checked.
__label__noRel	Great	There need to be some kind of moderation, either before or after comments are published
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	Take a few minutes to breathe, meditate, and physically calm your body down before you start typing your response.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	You can reduce hate speech in the comment section by flagging certain vocabulary which directly relates to hate speech, which then will automatically block the comment and therefore cannot be posted.	I agree that moderating the comment section with flagged phrases that automatically send comments for quick moeration would be a good solution.
__label__noRel	It helps other people contribute their feelings	Moderating comments sections is a lot of work to do manually, the individuals tasked with it would burn out in short time trying to manage that effectively while also having to read hateful garbage all day. If there was a system to remove hate speech it needs to be automated with an algorithm that catches certain words, then reviewed manually when someone disagrees with the content removed and it not being against guidelines. We use guidelines for everything including media regulations for accurate reporting or having to retract when information is not accurate. It's no different in the comments section, it doesn't remove free speech it regulates it to create a healthy environment to have a conversation in. Over moderation can have as severe of an effect as under, it has to be a system that takes in common complaints from both sides. Not the hate speech side per say but the sides of people who are pro free flowing conversation and those who want more shielding to avoid extremist echo chambers.
__label__noRel	I agree that having at least one moderator present would reduce/eliminate hate speech. It could be done after comments are automatically submitted (delete the hateful comments after public viewing within a certain time frame) or, even better, they can only be posted after careful consideration by the moderator(s), permitting only positive comments.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	Perhaps newspapers could use similar tools to respondology (https://respondology.com/ ) or hive moderation (https://hivemoderation.com ) that can identify and block hateful speech. This might well work and I think both of these use AI.
__label__noRel	I think this should be done by a real person, as using a computer, some hateful words can be disguised and still get through	people feel powerful behind an anonymous account, its easier to say things you would never normally say under the guise of anonymity, if it was easier to link a comment to who it came from and if people actually faced consequences from posting hate then this could help stop it.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	I agree that the only way to ensure balanced discussion without allowing hate or eliminating genuine responses is through moderation of comments before posting
__label__noRel	This would be a great idea, however, it's also important to take into notice that everyone has their own biased; so one statement could be hate speech to one but not the other	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	report comment buttons could be useful but there should be monitors that check comments before they are allowed to be posted
__label__noRel	That would reduce hate speech	I am reminded while discussing this of the way Daily Mail in UK handles the comments section. It just mentions on top of the comments page that theses comments are not moderated.So it allows everybody to express their opionion. This is how it should be done in my opinion
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	You should be allowed to give your opinion to express your view about a news article. To moderate this or to filter what you can and cannot say would it stop it from being free speech. What really needs to be looked at is to see how you can stop online trolling which I think is the root cause of some of these comment sections become so toxic. But for the media who is so depended on free speech themselves so that they can report on news in an unbiased way to eliminate the comment space is almost hypocritical. Just a weird idea here but perhaps you should do a quick test or verification before you can comment. A lot of people would not go through the effort of completing this if they just want to spread hate.
__label__noRel	This is one of the most sane posts in this discussion. Thank you.	Use a BOT to regulate hateful comments
__label__noRel	I agree	I think that the introduction of moderators to remove any hate speech would be beneficial. Perhaps the introduction of guidelines as to what constitutes permitted negative comments.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	I kind of agree, but I think that organisations have a responsibility to put something in place to monitor their comment sections. Even if it's not an algorithm and it's an actual person instead! Although your link shows how difficult this would be for a huge organisation like FB.
__label__noRel	But also... an open comment section provides these individuals with a platform and instead of the desired open communication to educate people, it can be that more people become radicalised.	I think there should be moderators on articles that make the comments. less visible so offensive comments can have a warning before viewing
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	I think comments give the ability to the users to express their opinion on what is described in the articles and this is an important rule for democracy. Removing the ability to comment in my view is basically limiting free speech. I also believe that user do not need necessarily to be identifiable, being anonymous is fine as long as they respect others and their opinions.
__label__noRel	There must be some sort of check not censorship	Freedom of speech still has its limits!!
__label__noRel	Reduces hate speech	I don't think it's helpful to cancel the comment space completely, we should have the ability to post our thoughts.
__label__noRel	the mod can even alert the authorities should they feel the hate speech warrants law enforcements	We live in a democratic society and so people have the right to their opinions. They just need to be voiced in the right way
__label__noRel	This might overcome some problems, but would be hard to remove subtle or 'disguised' hate speech, if only working on word triggers.	I think it's a bit of a lost cause. People will put hate speech in. The only way to stop it, I think is to not allow comments to be made. Technically, that's what happens with print versions of newspapers. We just read the article. Anyone who wants to express an opinion can write a letter to the editor. (Who would screen out hate stuff!). But, we live in an online world. So people expect to be able to have their say. And people probably wouldn't subscribe if they can't interact on an online service. Anyway, I do think people having verified accounts might help. Need to stop the "anonymous" profiles - the coward's castle types.
__label__noRel	It's up to the reader to consider what is true and what is untrue. I think newspapers could do more to provide guidance on how to evaluate the reliability of sources.	The use of a system that detect hate speech before publishing
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	This puts the power in many people's hands	It is important that people are able to have a voice, especially as it can be a great tool in educating people, and giving people a variety of viewpoints that they wouldn't necessarily get to often hear. Sometimes we learn best by hearing and understanding the views of other people. We don't have to necessarily change our opinions, but it can help us become more aware of why or how people feel a certain way about things.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	We can fairly reduce hate speech from newspapers websites without eliminating space for readers comments by encouraging people to give a reward who will comment without hate speech.
__label__noRel	However, some people may unfortunately not want to be educated and may still believe this stuff, but in that case no amount of removing comments, hate speech or education would help them, so they're already a lost cause.	Hate speech blocking will violate human rights to freedom of speech and cause people to feel opressed, as that would mean that they can not voice out their opinions.
__label__noRel	Controversial topics should be decided on how sensitive the information or event would be to groups that are targeted with hate speech due to protected characteristics e.g race, religion, gender, sexuality etc.	I think that a comment section is necessary for engagement and exchange of ideas but having said that, there should be a code for AI embedded within that platform which will be able to detect hate speech or words classified as hate speech then the AI can delete them automatically. Also people can report the comment and the AI should delete the comment within minutes of it being reported.
__label__noRel	I agree with this, as the issue of moderating newspaper comments also crosses the gap into social media where most newspapers will post their articles too.	Certain hateful words/phrases could be blocked or they could introduce a reporting option in the comments section.
__label__noRel	Issue with time and who gets priority for arguments	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I don't think this would a particularly helpful thing to do. Comment sections help readers make their contribution(s) to the discourse. Perhaps the development of algorithms that work through the comments to identify what's inappropriate and remove it.	Go through and censor out certain words
__label__noRel	Education = respect	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	I think it is interesting to read the comments on a newspaper article, as the article is written from one perspective, while the comments show a much wider view. Even if I disagree with them, it is interesting and thought provoking to read the alternative view. Disabling comments reduces free speech and makes everything monitored and authorised - then you have to question who is controlling what we see?	should be open to all
__label__noRel	We need some approaches to actually preventing hate speech and putting an end to it.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	It would require more time and effort	Proper moderation that does not tolerate racist, sexist or any other discriminating behavior or hate speech.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	have word filters
__label__noRel	I agree that removing the comments section is not a solution to stopping hate speech as this just encourages users to go to different platforms, users need to be able to post their opinions but newspapers should have a responsibility to monitor what is being posted as well as a responsibility on the tone of articles they post online as this can have an effect on the type of comments that users leave as some users will see an article and the tone of the article will make them respond in a controversial way which encourages hate speech.	I feel like there are certain topics for which disabling comments is the best option. For example extremely sensitive stories about severe crimes or ones that involve children.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I agree, there are currently no online hate speech statistics available due to a lack of means to report hate speech: https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/what-is-online-hate-crime/	Our freedom to do anything as part of a society is limited. Thus freedom of speech should be no different. Poeple need to be held accountable for their mistakes, so everybody else's rights will be protected. So having a set of keywords which are not allowed to be used is a way of reminding the writter that using the offensive word he/she is trying to use is considered a crime. An additional way to handle that is having the flag option by users and a team of moderators who follow a standard and will verify if flagged comments should be maintained or not. Lastly, anonymity might bring a feeling of impunity and even its possibility, so a way to avoid that is allowing one profile per person/email, where a fake username can be set, but, in the backstage, the website will know who it is that wrote each comment.
__label__noRel	people should be able to have an opinion, but without monitoring people would be offended all the time and thing could escalate very quickly.	I'm of the supporting view that the use of AI to filter out Hate speech could prove to be very useful
__label__noRel	Most people are for comments on new articles as it makes them feel like they have a voice as evidenced by this article	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	We should all have the option to voice our opinion. If doing so can result in hate speech, then we have to find a way to fight it instead of trying to eliminate comments altogether. Flagging certain words or using algorithms could potentially could help hide comments that don't add any value and are just trying to cause harm
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	I think the best way to reduce hate speech in newspaper websites is to ensure that the site can detect words and phrases that can be considered hate speech, and block them from being posted on the comment section. Also, a moderator to approve each comment section before it becomes publicly accessible is a notion which can be adopted as well.
__label__noRel	freedom of speech is important but not at the cost of other rights	Despite our general right to freedom of speech, hate speech remains inextricably linked to hate crimes and intolerance. A hard stance should be taken by newspapers against hate speech, utilising moderators to remove hateful comments, despite the fact that it could be construed as a restriction on free speech.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	The problem with moderating means that people may have a stance on what counts as a hate comment and may cause differing opinions and deletions of stuff that may just be outside someone's comfort zone https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	Large companies need to invest more money in having paiI td moderators to monitor hate speech on their articles. I think all speech excpet for speech inciting people to commit violence or murder should be allowed even if i so not agree with it. I think that to prevent hate sppech it will start with educating young people
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	Th Un have argued that we need to address hate crime https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech	The best thing would be to have some sort of app that monitors and regulate the language used. in a case where hate speech is found in a comment, the sentence should be blurred out.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	Identifying users with hate speech and restricting their accounts from using the platform and commenting on it.
__label__noRel	free speech should be controlled but allowed	This is not a black or white topic. The question is how exactly we define hate speech. Criticism in itself is not hate speech, but it is easy to take things to extremes, especially when someone expresses their opinion anonymously. Education about the reasons is important to better understand our own feelings and behaviour. Educate people do not restrict them!
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	I am reminded while discussing this of the way Daily Mail in UK handles the comments section. It just mentions on top of the comments page that theses comments are not moderated.So it allows everybody to express their opionion. This is how it should be done in my opinion
__label__noRel	100% correct	It is true that it would be difficult to remove and control all of the comments however i think it would be a lot more damaging to remove the right to freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I agree	comments should be allowed on newspaper articles so that people can have a discussion and express their opinions, regulation would ultimately ensure that everything is kept in order.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	There should be moderation reviewers to delete harmful comments
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	The comment section needs to be moderated using some kind of filter to automatically filter any words on the banned list and then use a report system to flag up anything which tries to bypass this. This will allow a human moderator to quickly decide what can be kept and what needs action.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	In a survey of news sites it was found that on average 11% of comments are removed...some of these are because they are spam and some because they are offensive. I think that the fact that it's more than one in two really shows how necessary moderation is, these issues are so common. Source: https://netino.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/WAN-IFRA_Online_Commenting.pdf (pg 7)
__label__noRel	Agree, moderation is the way to go, as hate speech should not be part of any media forums.	There needs to be a fine balance between freedom of expression and stopping hate speech. The best way is for comments to be screened as that would still allow opinions to be shared while ensuring the safety of all readers
__label__noRel	Some hate speech might actually be illegal, it should not be kept (https://www.report-it.org.uk/reporting_internet_hate_crime)	I also think the concept of Counterspeech to reduce the impact of hate speech could be beneficial.https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/counterspeech-better-way-tackling-online-hate
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	We could introduce a system online where it automatically filters out bad language or hate speech by using key words.

Yes I,m Gen X, yes I gre up with the old adage "sticks and stones make break my bones but words will never touch me" . It aint true, but its a good way to live your life.
__label__noRel	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button	I agree with this position since when providing personal data people would be less incentivized to starting hate speach
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	Recent political positions in the UK have lead to more fighting for 'free speech' and saying that it is ok to be offended - this is shown in a police news release (https://www.college.police.uk/article/protecting-freedom-expression-updated-guidance). I would disagree - offending people is unacceptable.
__label__noRel	I agree	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	Posting anonymously is not good. We should all be accountable to the website providers who have a duty to monitor their sites and act upon racist homophobe etc	We can fairly reduce hate speech from newspapers websites without eliminating space for readers comments by encouraging people to give a reward who will comment without hate speech.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way.

It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	It has been shown that comments sections are popular and do drive traffic to websites and make people spend more time on the site (so pleasing advertisers) So from a commercial/publishing point of view it would seem that some kind of moderation is the best way to deal with the problem and not eliminate the section altogether. (See https://webpublisherpro.com/your-website-needs-a-comments-section/)
__label__noRel	Unfortunately people will always exist that are hateful	As already demonstrated by other bigger social media companies, algorithms often contain and reinforce the negative biases of its creators, so I'm not sure how effective they would be in detecting and filtering out hate speech.

I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

Space on comments is a must have because many users get to participate into a good course that could help many others and therefore those spewing hate should be harshly dealt with. Blocked actively so
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	There is a fine line between free speech and hate speech. I don't think there is any way to reduce this because people will take the stand and say that their free speech is being taken away from them.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	The lines between hate speech and freedom of speecg and expression and constantly getting blurred further and further.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	I believe it is fair for hate speech comments to be censored, because it could lead to violent public behavior. (read this: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech)	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	I think that the website should develop a hate speech filtering software, to remove all offensive words that might be of hate speech.
__label__noRel	Breach of free speech	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	Some hate speech might actually be illegal, it should not be kept (https://www.report-it.org.uk/reporting_internet_hate_crime)	I think by holding the people that use hateful speech accountable i.e., blocking them from accessing newspaper websites
__label__noRel	Regulations fail, and extremists will point to any minor failing as strong proof of their firmly held beliefs.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	Creates a platform for fake news	It's a balance. There should be the ability to pre- and post-moderate comments. Pre- using technology to recognise potentially offensive words as well as closer moderation of articles on potentially controversial topics. Post-moderation to allow readers to report offensive topics which will be hidden from view until moderated.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Addressing hate speech does not mean limiting or prohibiting freedom of speech. It means keeping hate speech from escalating into something more dangerous, particularly incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence, which is prohibited under international law. https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	By having technology that can detect hate speech so that it can be blocked before it is posted.
__label__noRel	I agree, it is just what I said.	Recent political positions in the UK have lead to more fighting for 'free speech' and saying that it is ok to be offended - this is shown in a police news release (https://www.college.police.uk/article/protecting-freedom-expression-updated-guidance). I would disagree - offending people is unacceptable.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	Removing the comment section will only create a bigger revolt and uprise from people that write hate speech, and it will move to another media outlets. So the problem should be treated not silenced it. It is the responsibility of newspapers websites to police hate speech in order to create a safe environment for an healthy discussion about a news article. Otherwise you are cutting short an experience that users might want to have. So by censoring all the comment section your make erverybody pay a price for something that they haven't done. Moderation is the key and should be done my the newspapers websites according to the values they have.
__label__noRel	You can always talk in person freely or private conversations	Free speech is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it is necessary for an effective democratic society and on the other hand, people tend to abuse the right. Newspapers and publishing companies are major symbols of free speech, however, and there will always be disadvantages to be endured, hate speech inclusive. The solution is not to disable comment spaces but to continually implore and push for cooperation amongst readers.
__label__noRel	Freedom of speech comes with a responsibilty, and if people are not responsible with their rights, there should be measures put into place to fix that	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	This article describes how censoring might lead users to leave platforms and join other platforms with lighter censoring rules https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/global-extremes/does-censoring-radical-right-social-media-work/
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	I feel that all users should provide true identification that can be used if they use hate speech to find them/report them.
__label__noRel	Too big a problem to deal with	Identifying users with hate speech and restricting their accounts from using the platform and commenting on it.
__label__noRel	An algorithm in itself can be bias and discrimatory as proven by studies, it also may not take into consideration different languages	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	They shouldn't be removed completely because the allow for a open public forum for debate. They do however need to be regulated and moderated to try to reduce hate speech. Other users should have the ability to down vote comments report them for harmful opinions. These can then be assessed by professionals	Moderating comments could be a viable solution. The use of AI could make it easier given that there could be thousands and thousands of comments, too much for human moderator/s to keep track of.
__label__noRel	newspapers should remain impartial and hate speech leans on an opinion.	having a screener in the background conrtolling everything thats coming in and also comment section
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted.

__label__noRel	Absolutely, vague definitions are the downfall of effective communication. A lot like "Karen" replacing the actual words for situations like racist, entitled, rude, emotionally volatile, unreasonable etc. When we all hold a different definition for a word because it's been used too broadly it becomes harder to communicate. Clearly defining what hate speech is with links to the definitions in every format is what could help. People consume information more effectively in different modes like audio, visual, written etc.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__noRel	too many hate words	Limiting the algorithms push to only show negative or controversial viewpoints would go a long way to decreasing the hate comments.

I think that to prevent hate sppech it will start with educating young people
__label__noRel	This doesn't stop the issue of trolls creating a new account and commenting again. The internet makes it too easy for people to spread negative ideas.	Ensuring there are rules to adhere to, perhaps muting certain offensive words or phrases. Making sure commnect sections are heavily monitored.

__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.

__label__noRel	while free speech is our right and we are entitled to our own opinions, when you are promoting/endorsing hatred and discrimination of any sort, the line should be drawn. having a discussion/debate with opposing sides is normal and gives insight to both sides with little bias, but that cannot be used as an excuse to be hateful or discriminatory.

Considering a newspaper is a public platform, I believe everyone should try to be respective at all times. The comment space must not be removed, it helps to get insights of readers and is very helpful.

Also, comments should be monitored before being posted to the public.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	Commenters should agree to abide by all rules when signing up to the website and he banned for breaking the rules. Also all submitted comments must be thoroughly checked for negative for flagged words or topics.

It's about each users initial opinion on a certain subject and less about judging others opinions on what they think!!!!
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	Many people are against the reducing of hate speech from newspaper article, and I am with them on this.

__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	The difficulty with reducing hate speech, is that it is everywhere. It cannot feasibly be reduced with human power, but rather requires a computer system. The difficulty with an electronic system, is that it inherently requires money and financing, and therefore is incentivised to make money. When money is in the equation; thoughts, politics and ideas can be easily manipulated by those funding the system
__label__noRel	Totally agree with this and hopefully most rational people would.	I think there should a program that verify the comment before they are displayed on the newpaper
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used...

__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	The use of a system that detect hate speech before publishing
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	The only possible way to reduce hate speech is to have some kind of algorithm that may recognise certain words and phrases. Other than that it would mean moderating the comment section.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	Certain hateful words/phrases could be blocked or they could introduce a reporting option in the comments section.
__label__noRel	I found counterspeech the most effective way. Other emphathy based counterspeech can be discussed as well.	I believe if we can be on the same page and let the media tell the story the truth with out lashing out on it.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Ultimately the comments are needed to gather feedback in certain situations, removing the comments section wouldn't help us eliminate hate speech because where information needs to be gathered, no blacklist will help.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	Be more strict when allowing people to create profiles, that require identification before allowing anybody to comment. Stopping people being anonymous enough to feel confident while posting hate speech I think will be more beneficial than restricting peoples comments.
__label__noRel	The problem is hate speech needs to be clearly defined. There will be people that use "hate speech" as a means of having opinions they don't like removed.	By having an administrator who is able to monitor any comment posted, and removing hateful speech and giving warning to hateful viewers
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	Charactertisation of hate speech should be done case-by-case, rather than applied universally
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	1st position: comments on newspaper articles should not be allowed
__label__noRel	I like this idea, it sounds very fair	Firstly, newspapers need to enact a proper system of moderation. Blocking all comments infringes on free speech and does not allow readers to provide a counterpoint to the position provided in the article.
__label__noRel	The main question is how to determine what is considered as discrimination or violence. Opposing arguments can be flagged as discrimination or violense.	It seems like many users think that having your personally details posted along with your comment would be a deterrent for people to comment hate speech
__label__noRel	The content is then controlled by the moderators. How do we ensure that a comment they simply disagree with but still adds to the discussion is let through?	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	Removing the comment section will not prevent hate speech from occurring. People will find an alternative online platform, e.g. forums. Instead, companies should focus on moderating the comment section/providing links as to why posts that may be flagged are harmful. We need to focus more on prevention as opposed to reaction.	People tend to comment just to rile others up, which means it will be a lot of work to moderate. Perhaps an all or nothing approach is best.

__label__noRel	Agree with this. It's about getting the balance right to allow people to voice their opinions and add to the discussion without being hateful to others	Hate speech is something is completely unacceptable and should be eradicated by all means necessary however regulations are our best bet if we are to maintain freedom of speech at the same time.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Once you are found commenting with hate speech, you should apologize
__label__noRel	Agree with your suggestions. I had the same idea. However, there would need to be a way to get around mispellings of words to get around the blocked vocabulary.	A pop-up can be used which reads "if any 'hate speech' comment is discovered, it will be removed from these comments".
__label__noRel	Even if it is moderated, who is to say that the moderator is unbiased and won't let some comments through even though they contain hate soeech	I think that any 'contributors' should have a profile and should not be allowed to use an alias. I also think that there should be moderators looking at every post before it is published online.
__label__noRel	Hate speech should still not be given a platform	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it.

Despite my defence of human moderators, it seems they too are flawed -- check out this article https://www.technologynetworks.com/informatics/news/ai-trusted-as-much-as-humans-to-flag-hate-speech-365777 -- human moderators are not only prone to bias but also impractical. With the huge wealth of content posted every second online, it is unrealistic to expect humans to be able to view, criticise, and moderate every single comment.

__label__noRel	There is some evidence that AI systems can be pretty effective at detecting hate speech!

__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	Our freedom to do anything as part of a society is limited. Thus freedom of speech should be no different. Poeple need to be held accountable for their mistakes, so everybody else's rights will be protected. So having a set of keywords which are not allowed to be used is a way of reminding the writter that using the offensive word he/she is trying to use is considered a crime. An additional way to handle that is having the flag option by users and a team of moderators who follow a standard and will verify if flagged comments should be maintained or not. Lastly, anonymity might bring a feeling of impunity and even its possibility, so a way to avoid that is allowing one profile per person/email, where a fake username can be set, but, in the backstage, the website will know who it is that wrote each comment.
__label__noRel	this article : https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/830/3/032006 indicates that the algorithm that is considered to be the best for removing hate speech is still only just over 71% effective. This still leaves a lot of room for error.	Just pay moderators
__label__noRel	It is very hard to control every comment on these platforms and make sure that everything has been verified but if we want a place to be regarded as accurate and credible we need to find a way to make sure that fringe groups do not use these comment spaces as a place to spread further misinformation and discriminatory language.

__label__noRel	In principle a great idea, in practice this requires more money be spent on moderators and system updates	There needs to be proper moderation of comments so that no hate speech slips through the net.

__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	I've gone over most opinions on this topic. The best solution would be a bot that would filter out the harmful comments
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	What about allowing the comment section, but having a built-in screener running in the background, that automatically prevents posts with certain hateful words it is built to detect?
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	In summary, I think we should not remove comment sections. We need to "teach" AI to filter the comment section on newspaper websites. In that way, we can add or remove filters, and AI will simply do the work of making sure the comment section is appropriate. People should not get involved to directly filter comments, they may not be fair at all.
__label__noRel	I support the filtering of comments instead of removing the comment section. A filtering systems should be put in place	Well..hate speech is a problem then there is freedom of speech as well. There is a possibility a writer is giving valid points.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	Newspapers should have an algorithm that catches certain words or phrases which are hateful in nature. These words will be automatically flagged up and accounts that are flagged x amount of times should then be restricted from commenting for a period of time. If after this period, they continue to try and post comments with hateful content, they should be banned entirely from commenting.
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	the fairly way of reducing hate speech from newspapers website is not allowing anyone to comment that is to bloc the comment section.
__label__noRel	This is a good argument, instead of trying to stop free speech altogether rather look to filter out specifically hate speech.	they need to as often it is minorities which are affected
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	Discussion can be encouraged, but so often it leads to hate speech / one sided arguments. There needs to be a moderator in place to delete / hide certain comments, so free speech is allowed, but hate speech is not.
__label__noRel	I don't agree with removing the space for views to be aired. That is an important part of challenging and changing opinion. I agree that hate speech should not be tolerated so finding the users and punishing them is key.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	Reduces hate speech	I've gone over most opinions on this topic. The best solution would be a bot that would filter out the harmful comments

While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Moderating comments could be a viable solution. The use of AI could make it easier given that there could be thousands and thousands of comments, too much for human moderator/s to keep track of.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	There should be people assigned to go over the comments provided in order to ensure that the final approved posts do not contain hate speech. Basically a team set up to censor comments accordingly
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Hate speech invites violence and undermines people
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	Community moderation is used on many platforms to allow discussion whilst preventing hate speech from arising, however this is greatly dependent on human participation which can take a lot of work depending on the size of the community. Additionally, the removal of hateful comments can better a comment section, but will not change a commenters views- this has led to the development of more insular online communities fostering these more extreme or hateful views. People will create a space for their commentary if there isn't one provided (or if their comments are removed from somewhere). A lot of this comes down to what a given newspaper wants to be associated with (in the sense of their brand) as opposed to maintaining the sanctity of online discussion.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	Filter comments or have a ban on words that come across as hateful.
__label__noRel	yes, in this way since it will be able to detect hate speech, and readers will still have a chance to news others options, nor to add their thoughts into the account.	It is important that people are able to have a voice, especially as it can be a great tool in educating people, and giving people a variety of viewpoints that they wouldn't necessarily get to often hear. Sometimes we learn best by hearing and understanding the views of other people. We don't have to necessarily change our opinions, but it can help us become more aware of why or how people feel a certain way about things.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	Removing hate speech comments is also not a good thing because with the technology that we have, people will go and create fake accounts and still go back to comment hatefully and disrespecting words of which it will be a daunting task to delete all the comments
__label__noRel	Yes, any form of hate speech should never be tolerated.	Educate people about it
__label__noRel	Why do people read comment sections? To get informed and enlightened or because they are nosy and killing time? I think most of the time is the latter. I am not sure the comments expressed at the bottom of a page bring more value to the conversation than they bring potential offence, hatred and fights started just for the fun of it.	It is important to allow people to express their view to abide with freedom of speech. However, having the option to view these comment with a warning would allow people to ignore potential hate speech comments but still lets them read it if they want to.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	I disagree with the stance of doing away with the comment section in its entirety, it goes against the premise of media which is to spark a debate or discussion.
__label__noRel	Nobody should have to see it regardless.	Hate speech invites violence and undermines people
__label__noRel	The problem with allowing commentary to flourish without restrictions is that it can undermine the credibility of legitimate news sources. Frank Waddell, associate journalism professor at the University of Florida, noted that “If you see a bunch of individuals online who are leaving negative comments on a news article, you might think most people are evaluating this news as low quality,” Waddell said. “When asked to evaluate the news yourself, you might also think the news is more negative relative to someone who reads that same article without comments.” https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/	I don't think it's helpful to cancel the comment space completely, we should have the ability to post our thoughts.
__label__noRel	Yes I agree, I feel that we are probably fairly used to sifting through the rubbish on the internet, and at times the trolls can be entertaining, as long as it isn't nasty.	we could filter the comments and have a panel to decide
__label__noRel	Yes, it is a very difficult balance and trying to find mechanisms that are fair and balanced to control these are basically impossible to find.	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	I would agree, with addition that also misinformation, especially one that could induce negative consequences should be treated the same as hate speech	If we are to ban everyone who post a hateful comment we would be infringing on their basic right of freedom of speech. But the question still remains, when is it just a hateful comment and not hatred or propaganda. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression in press and other media. To some extent we dont have a right to block them from expressing their thoughts
__label__noRel	This could be a good approach. Education is important	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.

__label__noRel	However, I tend to agree with this opinion: https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/why-ending-anonymity-would-not-make-social-media-better.php . I don't think hate speech will end with the end of anonymity. We have to think about the possibilities of safety for human rights activists that only come with anonimity.	Use technology to monitor and block users
__label__noRel	I actually agree that eliminating the space for conversation on polarizing topics can reduce extremist echo chambers sometimes. Though they often move to other platforms that have zero regulations to hold that conversation when they can't have it where they saw something. Which increases the odds of being stuck in a hateful echo chamber.	What is characterised as hate speech needs to be assessed on a case by case basis. It is not absolute
__label__noRel	I agree. A big importance for newspapers is the comment section and people's opinion to what they have written. Although, the companies should take some responsibility to monitor the comments and what the other users will see.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	I don't think we can police websites 100% but if comments are moderated I think we can reach quite a high degree of compliance
__label__noRel	In addition to using algorithms, technology can be used to eliminate comments that involve hate speech for reader inclusivity. I definitely agree to this. Everyone has a freedom of speech, but it should infringe the rights of others too.	To ensure freedom of speech is still maintained, moderation needs to be carried out fairly. To achieve this, we need to understand what is hate speech and what are the lines that seperate that with constructive criticism. Attached is an article by the Standford encyclopedia of physiosphy regarding hate speech. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hate-speech/
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way.

If you take comments away because you're afraid of hate speech, you're going to be creating a barrier between you and your audience.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	agreed. people will always want their opinions heard	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	AI algorithms are frequently biased. There's still a long way to go before reliable AI algorithms are developed. Until then, using AI algorithms alone to moderate the comment sections of newspapers will likely lead to harmless comments removed, and, on the other hand, harmful comments published. https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/02/04/the-role-of-bias-in-artificial-intelligence/?sh=3bf5308b579d	we could use bots the get triggered when certain words are used. The bot will therefore remove the comment andhold it until it has mannually reviewed by a human. Another option can be to allow the users to report comments from other users and if the reports reach a certain threshold then hold that comment for review.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	I do not think it is possible, in a fair and just way. When speech is restricted that's called censorship. Who would justify the restrictive opinion?
__label__noRel	If the newspapers are providing a platform on which abuse can be given, they do have a responsibility to prevent it. Abuse is in no way shape or form valid criticism.	At the end of the day hate speech is not hate speech to everyone, I ended up reaching the conclusion that everyone has their own opinion about everything, So to want to filter or block comments is not freedom of speech, but building a sensitive society that is scared of debates and confronting serious issues, Its up to the receiver of the comment to act on it or not. Cyber bullying is a different story.
__label__noRel	Hateful comments should allow respondents to persuade otherwise. Comments can be a good force for change and shouldn't be cancelled.	People will always spew hate speech and regulating it may be difficult to do. Freedom of speech should prevail therefore eliminating the comments section would be wrong. The newspaper site may have an automation that identifies hate words and whenever these appear the comment should be hidden from the comments section.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	The root cause of most issues is likely from a select few, root out the troublemakers and ban accordingly.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	Allowing those to post it anonymously gives them the okay to do it over and over again without being called out over it.	Letting individuals know that as soon as someone comments, that is no longer confidential and if it is hate speech they shall be reported to authorities
__label__noRel	I can't see how this would work, it would still happen regardless of the size of the comments senction	I think we can do this by having comments sufficiently moderated and removed if needed if they are producing hate speech.
__label__noRel	This is like saying if there are less weeds in the garden there is less work. The weeds grow. We have to address the weeds.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	Moderators are useful but they will have their own bias and we cannot guarntee that they will be impartial, thus we remain in the same position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	It is easy to be hateful online when you are anonymous. Before being able to comment on newspaper websites, users should be required to sign up using traceable methods (eg. some form of identification). The comment section should regularly be monitored and any users who post hate speech should face serious consiquences
__label__noRel	I think people should have the right to comment but should do so respectfully.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	news media can look into AI technology to solve such problems.the machine will detect faul speeach and instantly hide or delete the comment ,then send a warning to the post writer

__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	It's a nice idea but requires a lot of investment to write the counterarguments. How do we ensure that time is worthwhile and the responses will even be effective?	The author of the post can moderate all comments before allowing them on the page. This does present the issue that only the author's views will be portrayed
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	comment sections should not be removed as that will prevent those with positive comments form sharing their thoughts, they should instead be reviewed regulary so that hate speech is flagged and removed another solution is for comments to be approved by moderators before they go public

__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	I found this really interesting, "Khan said the freedom of opinion and expression, including the right to seek, receive and disseminate diverse sources of information, must be upheld by States in times of crises and armed conflict as a precious ‘survival right’ on which people’s lives, health, safety, security and dignity depend."

__label__noRel	but AI is still weak right now to filter hate speech comments efficiently	You should be allowed to give your opinion to express your view about a news article. To moderate this or to filter what you can and cannot say would it stop it from being free speech. What really needs to be looked at is to see how you can stop online trolling which I think is the root cause of some of these comment sections become so toxic. But for the media who is so depended on free speech themselves so that they can report on news in an unbiased way to eliminate the comment space is almost hypocritical. Just a weird idea here but perhaps you should do a quick test or verification before you can comment. A lot of people would not go through the effort of completing this if they just want to spread hate.
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	Freedom of speech still has its limits!!
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes.

__label__noRel	You can't censor everybody because of the behaviour of the few.

__label__noRel	The main question is how to determine what is considered as discrimination or violence. Opposing arguments can be flagged as discrimination or violense.	Allow users to report comments.
__label__noRel	Hate comments can manifest into something much worse and is absolutely neccesary to destroy the source of the hate.	By currating comments individualy in person upon reporting. Auto block certain words e.g N word
__label__noRel	Free speech has a limit, and there is no reason why people should be allowed to post hate speech online.	By moderating the comment section. Instead of having an individual who may be biased in their moderation, the use of an artificial intelligence software can be introduced to moderate the comment section.
__label__noRel	i definately agree newspaper require multiple moderator who check every story before it gets published to the public	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	Counting on peoples's good behavior does not work. (https://www.washingtonpost.com/discussions/2020/04/13/community-rules/)
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	Moderating is good and maybe informing the person why their message was moderated so that they know and do better next time
__label__noRel	a more toward automation	Although it might be unfair for others, I think majority can agree that removing the comment section will be helpful because then it means anyone that has an opinion can rather call the newspaper.
__label__noRel	I agree	we could use bots the get triggered when certain words are used. The bot will therefore remove the comment andhold it until it has mannually reviewed by a human. Another option can be to allow the users to report comments from other users and if the reports reach a certain threshold then hold that comment for review.
__label__noRel	There is laws against discrimination and so should be upheld	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	Not if the idea is hateful to minorities.	I think the comments should be monitored to avoid hate speech
__label__noRel	but what if users arent using their real information, how can the goverment implement it then?	AI could be used to flag hate speech, meaning comments that are hate speech can be flagged at the time.

__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	not all stories need people to add their opinions sothat should ease the pressure on moderators
__label__noRel	right	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	I agree as many news papers in our days don't have comment sections as it is expensive and time consuming	Space on comments is a must have because many users get to participate into a good course that could help many others and therefore those spewing hate should be harshly dealt with. Blocked actively so
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	Filter the comments so that any with known hate speech terms cant be posted. Make sure people sign in to make comments etc
__label__noRel	I agree that hate speech can never be completely eliminated	There should be serious repercussions against hate speech
__label__noRel	I disagree, try to read everyone's idea. Some are feasible and doable	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	By flagging certain vocabulary which relates to hate speech and once this is flogged, the person commenting is blocked from posting their view. We would need to look at ways of getting around mispellings of the words though, as people could use this to get past the AI.
__label__noRel	If the newspaper website does not monitor the comments on their platform then who will? They have just as much responsibility to stop hate speech as the public and need to be involved in this issue.	Have moderators who constantly monitor and remove hateful posts or ones that are inciting others/goading others.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	newspapers should not have a comments section.
__label__noRel	problem is, it's not children doing it, its people past general education and often adverse to adult learning full stop	i believe comment are important, to allow people to discuss. sometimes you can get factual information from other people comments
__label__noRel	It goes down to respect when we address one another.	flag all the comments that contain vulgar words and warn the sender. the comment must be rephrased, failure to do so must result in the suspension of the sender from commenting

__label__noRel	I think that this is correct but mst places have a law or legal guideline as to what it considered hatespeech n that country	I think we could have a hold on comments until it is checked and fact checked by a panel of people! Not just one person making the decision. Also I think if there were stricter punishments for hate speech the newspaper would make the person and newspaper think twice.

__label__noRel	new ideias and opportunities	There should be people assigned to go over the comments provided in order to ensure that the final approved posts do not contain hate speech. Basically a team set up to censor comments accordingly
__label__noRel	I agree	It must me a government's responsibility to implement policies against hate speech.https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-to-combat-fake-news-and-disinformation/
__label__noRel	When your beliefs are entwined with your identity, changing your mind means changing your identity. That’s really hard for most people.	every comment submitted by readers must be checked internally for hate speech
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	By using moderators or AI to police the posts
__label__noRel	AI would be a great tool in conjunction with other moderation measures but is not reliable enough to be used on its own.	We can have a system where every comment has to be checked and vetted for hate speech and if it infringes on any of the platform's rules and regulations then the comment is automatically removed.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	I think there should be moderators on articles that make the comments. less visible so offensive comments can have a warning before viewing
__label__noRel	Genuine hate speech will be ignored with that view	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Hate speach and racism could be dealt with and in time persecuted	The only possible way to reduce hate speech is to have some kind of algorithm that may recognise certain words and phrases. Other than that it would mean moderating the comment section.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	There needs to be a level of moderation before comments are posted. Comments that are harmful, false or misleading shouldn't be allowed to be put up, but there should still be room for healthy debate.
__label__noRel	A perceived reputable source, but can have political leanings and opinions.	Use a BOT to regulate hateful comments
__label__noRel	maybe get something to control what comes in and goes out	I understand that there will always be people saying the comment section needs to stay as we are all allowed free speech.
__label__noRel	some ideas are extreme and inconsiderate	i agree that removing comments about hate speech is not the way to go
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	Freedom of speech allows others to express their opinions so we can have an open debate in the hopes of coming to some common agreement about polarising topics. https://youtu.be/WtftZPL-k7Y
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	Moderating comments sections is a lot of work to do manually, the individuals tasked with it would burn out in short time trying to manage that effectively while also having to read hateful garbage all day. If there was a system to remove hate speech it needs to be automated with an algorithm that catches certain words, then reviewed manually when someone disagrees with the content removed and it not being against guidelines. We use guidelines for everything including media regulations for accurate reporting or having to retract when information is not accurate. It's no different in the comments section, it doesn't remove free speech it regulates it to create a healthy environment to have a conversation in. Over moderation can have as severe of an effect as under, it has to be a system that takes in common complaints from both sides. Not the hate speech side per say but the sides of people who are pro free flowing conversation and those who want more shielding to avoid extremist echo chambers.
__label__noRel	I agree while hate speech can be and should be monitored and removed immediately in order to reduce trauma on affected group and not to embolden other bigots. Platforms should still allow users to express opinions contrary to the creators. Peer review of reporting works well in these instances when someone goes too far - but this is also abused by with review bombing	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__noRel	more moderation	Allow for a voting system on the comments, so as the cream rises to the top and the dredges sink away.
__label__noRel	I am deeply uncomfortable with the idea of 'tracking people down' for 're-education' for the sin of offering their opinions online (even if said opinions are quite obnoxious).	More control by moderators plus a code of conduct for users
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I agree with you but there would have to be a lot of work put into the filters as people do get around them and still are able to make their hateful points using text speak or misspelling ever so slightly. This is just something that would have to be considered.	It must me a government's responsibility to implement policies against hate speech.https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-to-combat-fake-news-and-disinformation/
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Many people are against the reducing of hate speech from newspaper article, and I am with them on this. The main reason for putting comment section on newspaper websites was for readers to leave a comment, people will always have something to say whether it is good or bad. But AI can still be used to remove comments that can be severely harmful.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	freedom speech is good but it assumes that common sense prevails too
__label__noRel	It can be difficult to monitor everything all the time, but I think if something is reported and not deleted then fair enough.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Sadly not everyone can be polite enough to express themselves without the use of hate speech, hence such people should be blocked as we cannot tolerate it.	by having a system or word check that will not allow users to use words that are considered as hate speech
__label__noRel	Have to agree with this as this will allow people to freely express their views without the fear of hate speech	I know this has been discussed a few times potentially in reply to comments but I'd like to repeat it again: language is complex and you can't simply ban or flag certain terms or phrases and think you catch all the hate speech comments etc. While a report button and the use of a software that can support a human moderator is in essence a good idea, it might also delete comments that do not actually contain HS or completely miss others overall. I think this decision by the newspaper turned into an entire discussion of manageability of monitoring discussion sections and away from the ethical considerations.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	Maybe online newspapers can invest in text mining, where if hate speech is detected, the comment will not go through. Or, in the comments section, there could be a greyed message in the background that states a non-tolerance to hate speech.
__label__noRel	yes i argree with this. it would not show that the newspaper is biased by leaving the positive comments only	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	Totally agree with this and hopefully most rational people would.	Freedpn of speech doesnt mean you must promote hate speech on newspapers, it basically means you free to voice out your concerns in around society in a more respectfull manner.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Filter comments or have a ban on words that come across as hateful.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	Hate speech is not free speech. It must be banned
__label__noRel	Yes 100%	More control by moderators plus a code of conduct for users
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	To ensure freedom of speech is still maintained, moderation needs to be carried out fairly. To achieve this, we need to understand what is hate speech and what are the lines that seperate that with constructive criticism. Attached is an article by the Standford encyclopedia of physiosphy regarding hate speech. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hate-speech/
__label__noRel	yes i agree with you, the comment section should remain open but people have to remember to be respecyful and consider other peoples emotions	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__noRel	I also agree this is a good solution	We live in a democratic society and so people have the right to their opinions. They just need to be voiced in the right way
__label__noRel	This is a measured, moderate response which looks to preserve the best of both worlds.	Moderation is key. Plenty of newspapers and online media are able to keep comments open with a bit of moderation.

__label__noRel	I agree. It's also a good way to give a second chance to a person in order for them to change their behavior. And maybe help them understand that they are writing hateful thing, and educating them in a sense.	I would almost agree that removing the comments would be beneficial. I've very rarely seen a comment on an article that actually contributed towards learning more about the content. It's typically just people yelling they don't agree without any true thought.
__label__noRel	b	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	Need clear understanding of what is considered hate speech on this platform.	It is a tricky one to get the balance correct. There will always be some people in society who are happy to spout nonsense/hatred online as they sit behind a keyboard. At the same time, there will also be people who wish to share their more sensible and respectful views on topics.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	I think this is good and supports freedom of speech, but at the same time, we cant really control "aggressiveness" in people especially considering that the degreees of acceptable aggressiveness varies with each person	report comment buttons could be useful but there should be monitors that check comments before they are allowed to be posted
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	I think that education with penalties such as exclusion from the community for repeated offences is the best policy. Like many I agree that some people are unaware they unaware they have caused offence to others.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	I think newspapers should not take away the comment section. Firstly this is unfair to all the people who want to have their say and should be able to do so Dominicis wrong
__label__noRel	I agree, if we were to allow the public to have 'freedom of speech' We need to ensure someone who is unbiased can remove the comments that will only fuel hatred and not give a well structured opinion a chance.	The best way to curb hate speech would be to have the comments section moderated for any forms of hate speech. In this manner people who have an opinion with substance can have a say in whatever article that was published.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	Regulation of the newspaper comment section should be done. There should be moderators who have the ability to remove certain comments if they feel it is needed.
__label__noRel	People constantly find their way around word filters and more often than not it filters a lot of genuine non hate comments too.	I believe that with real time moderation , if the comments can be removed before causing any distress to people then this is a better option than removing the ability to make comments.
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	the removal of comment spaces is not good for the well being of humans because other people share ideas using the comment space and other comments can make certain people happy.
__label__noRel	Although i understand why limiting comments would reduce hate speech, unfortunately it then plays to the smaller group in society that causes the problems. The majority of people can have a great debate without taking to name calling etc	flag all the comments that contain vulgar words and warn the sender. the comment must be rephrased, failure to do so must result in the suspension of the sender from commenting
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Certain hateful words/phrases could be blocked or they could introduce a reporting option in the comments section.
__label__noRel	Absolutely agree,and public opinion seems to favour this approach.	One cost-effective way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites while promoting reader comments is to outsource reader comments to social media. Comment sections can show comments for the article from social media platforms, while encouraging users to post comments onto these platforms. This way, hate speech can be reduced by social media platforms, which are more experienced with content moderation, have extensive rules in place, and have economies of scale with regard to content moderation compared to newspapers.
__label__noRel	while free speech is our right and we are entitled to our own opinions, when you are promoting/endorsing hatred and discrimination of any sort, the line should be drawn. having a discussion/debate with opposing sides is normal and gives insight to both sides with little bias, but that cannot be used as an excuse to be hateful or discriminatory.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	If there was identifiable information available (to the owner of the website), for people who contribute their opinions publicly, it would make people less inclined to say awful things.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I disagree and believe that other views should be respected and be allowed to be aired. If we only read one particular newspaper then our view will become one sided, with a comments section arguing different points, then it opens us up to many other arguments.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	Somewhat agree with this statement. The marginalised are oftentimes the focus of hate.	I don't think this is possible. We should go back to physical printed newspapers.
__label__noRel	Taking away hate speech may not allow the audience to actually continue to express any opinions at all	Could ensure moderation of commonly used words for hate speech, and frequent moderation on these websites
__label__noRel	Th Un have argued that we need to address hate crime https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech	People should be members with addresses checked
__label__noRel	IT is absoluety the websites job to police polirising comments if nesccearry to keep peace wihthin the outiside community viewing their newspapers.	There is no discussion on free speech to have : free speech is absolute or not. If you don't like free speech then go live in China.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Moderation is necessary. Closing comments is not the answer, as communication can help people to understand each other's viewpoints. If you take comments away because you're afraid of hate speech, you're going to be creating a barrier between you and your audience.
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	/?Are there ways to better police it and identify key words/phrases? Is there an automated moderator program?
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	By utilising AI so that it can look for certain words that could be deemed offensive.
__label__noRel	the things is they might create fake accounts or have bots commenting on their behalf.	We can fairly reduce hate speech from newspapers websites without eliminating space for readers comments by encouraging people to give a reward who will comment without hate speech.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	Is it necessary to have readers comments? What do they add to the article?
__label__noRel	I believe if almost everyone who knows about hate speech will know what to say and what not to say.	Removing the comment section should not be an option, we should not lose the right to freedom of speech based on the likelihood that a few may post hateful comments, strict moderation and being able to report hate speech is the solution. Having people sign up for platforms and use ID to which they could be held personally accountable is an option as well. Hate Speech often comes from being able to hide behind a keyboard, screen and a fake username.
__label__noRel	This article also discusses the use of moderators https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	moderating the comments
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	It is a lenthy and compelx issue since different countries seem to have different rules and law governing freedom of speech according to their cultures or even political establishements	Allow users to report comments.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	I think the best option would be to put some moderators that are educated about hateful speeches and let them see comments before they are online so that they can decide to approved them or not. They are doing it in Germany (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793)
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	I think removing space for comments is not the solution because how else will people discuss the matter at hand or share their opinion. I think hate speech should be set to be hidden from being viewed instread.
__label__noRel	I agree	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem

Another option can be to allow the users to report comments from other users and if the reports reach a certain threshold then hold that comment for review.
__label__noRel	I agree. Some for of moderation is needed. Users should have to agree to some sort of "anti hate speech" policy when signing up and accounts who violate the policy (by posting hate speech) should be banned. The moderation can be done similarly to how social media platforms such as Instagram allows users to filter out certain keywords from their comment section and any comments with those words do not appear in the comment section as seen here ( https://help.instagram.com/700284123459336 )	This project takes the approach of counterspeech, whereby hateful comments are not removed, but instead responded to with alternative, police and non-aggressive comments. https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/counterspeech-better-way-tackling-online-hate
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__noRel	I disagree people need to show what they think about what has been written	Having the option for complete anonimity and alter egos should be removed. I believe people will be much more careful with what they say if their name and face is attached to it.
__label__noRel	I don't think the best education policy will combat trolls, bad faith actors or targeted/well orchestrated hate campaigns.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	Yeah. That's true anyway. Freedom of speech is good but protecting the citizens and preventing violence through hate speech is also great	There have to a way to remove hate speech before it could reach the comment space, the comment space is important because some people will help to improve the online newspaper
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	hate speech must be clearly defined, it should not be left to the media to decide what is and is not considered hate speech
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	As much as I agree with you that everyone should be able to express their own ideas. The internet is full of trolls who are constantly usung hate speech and without any guidelines or moderation. It's quite impossible for there not to be any "aggressiveness."	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	There should be people assigned to go over the comments provided in order to ensure that the final approved posts do not contain hate speech. Basically a team set up to censor comments accordingly
__label__noRel	It is nice to read things you agree with, and proabaly helps sell newspapers	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	Must include specialist training for moderators as well.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	I agree as it would feel very weird to not have comment sections	In addition to reducing hate speech by site moderation community moderation could also take place having the ability to flag a post for the attention of moderators which violates terms of service.
__label__noRel	Not allowing hateful comment does not mean we limit people freedom of speech but promote kindness.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	I believe removing the comment section is not a solution and that it actually encourages hate speech
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	Newspaper comment spaces allow people the opportunity to share their opinions and feel that they can contribute their thoughts and ideas - it can also help readers engage with the content in a different way.
__label__noRel	thats the bad outake as they will sell the information they want without any way for it to be debated	While hate speech can be harmful , it can also be helpful. If we can read through the speeches we can be able to determine what the problem is from the comments and improve.We can also create work limit on comments.
__label__noRel	This definitely needs human input, it's too sensitive a matter for machines!	you must run a bot system that will automatically detect and remove posts with mature language
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	Make readers agree to not sharing hate speech and let them know that if they do, they will be blocked from commenting.
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	It may be a good idea to involve some form of moderators to check if there are any hate speeches. Aggressive comments may be censored accordingly. However, we need to be careful in doing this as some may have negative effect as silencing voices.
__label__noRel	I agree that having at least one moderator present would reduce/eliminate hate speech. It could be done after comments are automatically submitted (delete the hateful comments after public viewing within a certain time frame) or, even better, they can only be posted after careful consideration by the moderator(s), permitting only positive comments.	Instead of removing the comment section newspapers can try and look up new and different ways to facilitate their reader engagement.
__label__noRel	I disagree people need to show what they think about what has been written	Companies aswell as the users should be liable and held accountable for allowing a platform to be used to share hate speech
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__noRel	I also agree because reading what people thinks about your work or your outlet is important. if not then how could the writer improve?	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	read though the comments and only put on the comments with the less hate speech on
__label__noRel	This will improve the language but not the other content	https://en.unesco.org/5-ways-to-counter-hate-speech
__label__noRel	I think that would be a good thing as there isn't really a way to predict how someone will react to specific words or general ideas used against them	Freedom of speech still has its limits!!
__label__noRel	This would be great if people would not abuse the power to share freely by sharing hate speech and slander. us as humans need to be regulated by a set of rules in order to keep a functioning society and i think a filtered comment section is the solution.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	more online platform needs a moderator role, too often you see posts on social media that have rampant hate speech going unfiltered and the commenter going unpunished	I also believe that a filter or having a group of moderators constantly filtering out the negative - hate speech would be beneficial. Similar to other social media platforms, users of the platform perhaps should be allowed to flag or report comments that aren't appropriate,and then a moderator should check the report and take the steps necessary to make the platform a safe space.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can spread rapidly, and destroy lives. It is offensive, hurtful and can ruin people. I think this is a very bad opinion to take.	Issues around hate speech bring into clear relief the emergence of private spaces for expression that serve a public function, this may lead to violence or non-radical behaviors for the public at large. The only possible way of reduction is for writers to not write or give out any opinions of hate speech. This will ensure that readers are comfortable.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Discussion can be encouraged, but so often it leads to hate speech / one sided arguments. There needs to be a moderator in place to delete / hide certain comments, so free speech is allowed, but hate speech is not.
__label__noRel	I think it is a good idea to be able to flag the comment so moderators can review it	There should be hate speech words that should be used to warn the user and not allow them to post by disabling the post button if there are hate speech words.
__label__noRel	I think this is very important. Hate speech will drive away advertisers as they will not want to be associated with hateful comments. Newspapers will have to stop those comments to retain revenue. Facebook has started to process and it is about time other media outlets follow. https://www.facebook.com/community/whats-new/new-tools-features-nurture-community/	By having technology that can detect hate speech so that it can be blocked before it is posted.
__label__noRel	Does not give diversity to the story.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	I agree	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	I think there must be a system that will detect hateful comments and block them.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	Hate speech can be positive criticism and essential in some posts, altgough it can be offensive and totally uncalled for in other posts. A way in which social media apps regulate and monitor the comments, otherwise people have rights to freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	The problem with AI is that it lacks morality, thus it can be exploited for other and selfish reasons.	I totally agree that hate speech should be limited as some readers do not take it lightly and may harm themselves after reading. I have heard stories about people ending their lives after their stories which often are embarassing are published, and the situation made worse by the comment section.
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	have an active moderator to remove any hate speech
__label__noRel	Sometimes people do need to be censored, especially when it comes to hate speech because sometimes those words become actions and people get assaulted in real life. Words spoken online sometimes rally people together to take action (for example what happened in the United States when people stormed the Capitol because of fake news spreading online about the voting results being fraudulent https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/06/election-misinformation-helped-fuel-jan-6-capitol-attack-now-climate-misinformation-threatens-planet/ )	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	I agree	A moderated comments section can solve this problem. Freedom of speech does not need to include hate speech. An opinion can be given that doesn't include hate speech in it.
__label__noRel	I also don't think the removal of a comments section will make them take further, alternative action.	readers comments be moderated and anything that is harmful, hateful or hurtful should be removed. this allows people to exercise their right of freedom of speech but limiting the harm that someones opinion may have
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	I still think a filtering system of removing categorically hateful words could help a little, but there is still the big problem of other comments bypassing that. I think an independant and unbiased moderation team could help to remove the issue of the newspapers removing valid critisism or comments about inaccurate reporting for example.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Computers should be able to detect hate speech if there is any and report and remove that comment whinin minutes of posting it
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Using moderators, educating users, calling out trolls and haters!
__label__noRel	Stops the bullying and people feeling bad	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	i agree with the comment about fake news, a lot of people reading online articles are vulnerable to taking information at face value without checking whether or not there is actual evidence for this	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Internet education is definitely needed	In the digital world we live in - unfortunately hate speech is part and parcel of the benefits of having such an open forum and allowing everyone to have a voice. Hate speech is made by a minuscule minority of people. Perhaps have a 'report hate speech' button that members of the community can use.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks.

__label__noRel	you are very correct	comment sections should not be removed as that will prevent those with positive comments form sharing their thoughts, they should instead be reviewed regulary so that hate speech is flagged and removed another solution is for comments to be approved by moderators before they go public
__label__noRel	it has to be completely restricted	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	While freedom of speech is a human right, it is imperative to be cognizant of the fact that each and every person has the right to have their rights respected. It is for this reason that readers comments cannot be removed. Everyone has the right to make a comment and we do not necessarily always have to agree, we always have to respect. A system can be put in place to remove any vulgar language.

__label__noRel	I don't think they do.

__label__noRel	It's true that eliminating the comments section might be helpful to prevent some ideas to spread more quickly.	One way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for reader comments would to have active community managers who are activetly managing the comment section.

__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	The best way to reduce hate speech would be to make sure that moderators are present to check on comments, it would not be advisable to cancel comments completely due the feedback it gives and people will always have their opinions and sometimes they will involve hate speech, which is unavoidable...

__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	Not possible to to it completely, hate spech can be quite subtle. Needs real time moderation.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	A lot of the times I hear people railing against the censorship of hatespeech it is because they aren't aware of the damage they are causing or have been caught out saying something they didn't think was bad to begin with. I think that anything that is removed should be explained to the poster as well as the impact that t could have on other people
__label__noRel	This should prevent the majority of hate speech to be eliminated.	There are other ways to reduce or block hateful comments without having to eliminate comment section.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	I think that the website should develop a hate speech filtering software, to remove all offensive words that might be of hate speech.

__label__noRel	It is difficult to moderate in a completely unbiased way and it would not be right for moderation to influence opinion.	I think the best option would be to put some moderators that are educated about hateful speeches and let them see comments before they are online so that they can decide to approved them or not. They are doing it in Germany (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793)
__label__noRel	I agree	Hate comments are always not good for any person
__label__noRel	If you eliminate comments completely you both take away the right to free speech and inhibit the ability to have an open discussion about what constitutes hateful and offensive comments	I think all the hate speech my be removed before it is published on public
__label__noRel	It is nice to read things you agree with, and proabaly helps sell newspapers	I think that education with penalties such as exclusion from the community for repeated offences is the best policy.

One way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for reader comments would to have active community managers who are activetly managing the comment section.

__label__noRel	I find it very helpful when the comments includes updates or links to a more current news story	The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is often used as a reason not to have readers comments.

Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	This could be done through public opinion, such as what the general public would consider less restricted and what is acceptable in current society.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	I also think the concept of Counterspeech to reduce the impact of hate speech could be beneficial.https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/counterspeech-better-way-tackling-online-hate
__label__noRel	What is considered free speech (and should therefor be allowed) depends heavily on the location of the platform and the user. In the US free speech is protected by law to a much greater extend than in Europe. In the US there are only a few categories of speech not protected by the First Amendment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_free_speech_exceptions), like incitement to lawless action. In Europe however free speech stops there where it infringes on someone else their rights, for example the right to not be discriminated against. Racism and targeted hate for that reason is not protected by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights) or the national laws of many of the European countries.	Personally I think it would require a well developed algorithm moderated by a team that updates it regularly to make sure it flags the correct material and continually updates it's database of words, phrases and dogwhistles
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	Have them reviewed after they are posted and do not allow them to be viewed before they are revied, as well as keeping tabs on the user posting the comments.
__label__noRel	This can hinder the increase of hate speech by filtering out the hate words	Space on comments is a must have because many users get to participate into a good course that could help many others and therefore those spewing hate should be harshly dealt with. Blocked actively so

__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	we could filter the comments and have a panel to decide
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	I agree completely. People need to be educated	As already demonstrated by other bigger social media companies, algorithms often contain and reinforce the negative biases of its creators, so I'm not sure how effective they would be in detecting and filtering out hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	I think rather than removing the option to comment/debate below an article, there could be moderators and hate speech buttons and bots to keep hate speech at bay.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	This is a win or loose situation. People will still continue with their comments even if it is not on the newspapers website. A person can take a screenshot of the topic and then twit it on twitter and then people will give their different opinions. The newspaper can still allow for readers comment however, the hate speech comments can be filtered.

__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	The power of newspapers is too strong and needs to be restricted , moderation of the comments section is needed linked with non anonymous posting of mcomments
__label__noRel	I agree, what's the line between hate speech or just having a differing opinion	I think certain people should be not allowed to share their opinions publicly because their only intention is to create hate and to upset people.

__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I think adding chat bans for repeat offenders of hate speech could help.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	I agree. Users should be able to to flag harmful comments and report them to a moderator.

__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry.

__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	in my opinion there should be no comment section , article should be true and commenting no needed
__label__noRel	I agree	Readers should be able to comment but be informed of certain comments that would be considered hate speech. If they are aware and still choose to comment hateful words, the newspaper website should feel comfortable enough to remove those comments since the reader was informed that comments like those would not be acceptable.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry.

Blocking words does not stop hate, what we need to do is have a filter that alerts a human so that a post.

__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed.

__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	One way I propose to prevent hate speech is to remove anonymity online. Not being able to hide should limit cowardly behavior and thus reduce harmful speech.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	I believe comment sections should be moderated more to prevent the obvious hate speech and statements that do not add anything useful to the discussion
__label__noRel	This doesn't stop the issue of trolls creating a new account and commenting again. The internet makes it too easy for people to spread negative ideas.	Newspaper websites should also be held accountable if they do not deal with hate speech
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	The comment section must be cut off
__label__noRel	An issue is how can we differentiate being aggressive from being passionate. This only leaves room for newspapers to censor comments they do not like.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	All very good and valid points, i am in total agreement with PriceP. Very well put.	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	I think it's a bit of a lost cause. People will put hate speech in. The only way to stop it, I think is to not allow comments to be made. Technically, that's what happens with print versions of newspapers. We just read the article. Anyone who wants to express an opinion can write a letter to the editor. (Who would screen out hate stuff!). But, we live in an online world. So people expect to be able to have their say. And people probably wouldn't subscribe if they can't interact on an online service. Anyway, I do think people having verified accounts might help. Need to stop the "anonymous" profiles - the coward's castle types.
__label__noRel	Moderating will reduce hate speech and allow open discussion without personal, insulting opinions	There should be automatic filters but they are not 100, so there should also be a team of people constanly monitoring and reviewing complaints and reports. I feel like it is the only way to keep the freedom of speech but also protect people who might be victims of it.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	In as much as we would like to shy away from it, it is inevitable that people will have something negative to say. It is up to the developers of the website to filter through comments or at least set an approval time for each post.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	The problem with moderating means that people may have a stance on what counts as a hate comment and may cause differing opinions and deletions of stuff that may just be outside someone's comfort zone https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793

__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	I agree with the point of view that there should be a broad spectrum of moderators to stop any particular biased opinion or agenda from controlling the comments.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	some people wont like being told what they can and cannot say	The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is often used as a reason not to have readers comments. It seems that this is not a fair argument for eliminating readers comments because of the psychological phenomenon of "cognitive dissonance" - we automatically search for echo chambers in any context.
__label__noRel	disagree, chat feature is useful	In today's world where technology has advanced to such a degree, I'm of the belief that creating parameters that protect individuals from any form of hate speech is very much possible through things such as AI. The removing of commenting sections could be argued as a violation to one's freedom of speech, it also means the views and opinions of the public will be lost which could have detrimental effects.
__label__noRel	Hate speech is used to intentionally hurt others. It cannot be allowed in modern-day society and should not be seen as free-speech	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	I agree	If we are to ban everyone who post a hateful comment we would be infringing on their basic right of freedom of speech. But the question still remains, when is it just a hateful comment and not hatred or propaganda. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression in press and other media. To some extent we dont have a right to block them from expressing their thoughts
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	Everyone is entitled to freedom of speech but hate speech can be detrimental to readers and the topics mental health. I think the best way to deal with hate speech is to have filtered comments, raising awareness and age restrictions on wensites and comment sections
__label__noRel	this is a great way to monitor the section	In this same article, there is a section further down using reddit as an example. A particular subreddit inroducted strict rules for their comment section, and with over 30 moderators, people follow them and create a good environment.

__label__noRel	This is not in line with our right to freedom of speech.

__label__noRel	I like it but i worry it would just be ignored. Just removing a comment isn't much of a deterrent	Instead of removing the comment section newspapers can try and look up new and different ways to facilitate their reader engagement.
__label__noRel	law enforcement could be notified easily	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__noRel	i agree	Removing the comment section will only create a bigger revolt and uprise from people that write hate speech, and it will move to another media outlets. So the problem should be treated not silenced it. It is the responsibility of newspapers websites to police hate speech in order to create a safe environment for an healthy discussion about a news article. Otherwise you are cutting short an experience that users might want to have. So by censoring all the comment section your make erverybody pay a price for something that they haven't done.

__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	It is easy to be hateful online when you are anonymous. Before being able to comment on newspaper websites, users should be required to sign up using traceable methods (eg. some form of identification). The comment section should regularly be monitored and any users who post hate speech should face serious consiquences

__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	We should have a clear definition for hate speech in order to regulate the comment section. For example, comments suggesting certain groups be harmed or should not exist, and language that suggests these groups are inferior without providing educational evidence. We need to keep the comment section a place of discussion and education.

Online hate speech unfortunately can have the effect of increasing violence against minorities (https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons) but blocking all free speech because of the actions of a few seems like a poor decision.

I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words.

__label__noRel	Differing opinions mare easily recognized for what they are. Whereas as hate speech can spark a lot of dangerous events. The comment's section helps people share knowledge easily and if it's not serving that purpose then it should not be allowed. https://researchoutreach.org/articles/hate-speech-regulation-social-media-intractable-contemporary-challenge/	Allowing people who have profiles with the website to comment. Anonymity should not be allowed. Information that is traceable to an individual could be implemented(even though may be intrusive) could be requested when creating a profile. Examples, a cellphone number that is FICAd , student number, loyalty card number and the like.

__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	The use of admins and moderators can be helpful in removing hate speech. They would need strict rules for the public in order to not let their own personal biases judge what is and isn't considered hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree that there should be technologies that are able to scan and the comment section to detect and flag any offensive/derogatory words in the comments before the comments are published.	Asking people to identify themselves when doing their registration. If we remove the anonymous factor, people will be afraid to act like trolls.
__label__noRel	Such algorithms can be completely customized. For example: any posts containing a list of any key words can be prevented from posting.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	I believe the comment section should be open to all to express their opinions.We need freedom of speech. Hate speech can be ignored. But it is important to show the view of all.
__label__noRel	I completely agree. It's not the job of online sites to become speech police. I frequent many different online comment sections, and oddly enough, hateful comments are swiftly dealt with by other contributors. Sometimes the best way to eliminate hate speech, is to allow it to be seen, then vastly condemned by those seeing it. Algorithms should be used to deal with trolling. Honest, sometimes brutal comments should not censored just because they make others uncomfortable.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	people must change, not internet/website
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	i think people need to be educated better about what Hate Speech is.
__label__noRel	and what do we filter?	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	some mistook freedom of speech for spreading the hate speech. Some root causes of hate speech originate from child hood traumas and are deep, i do not think that we may be able to tackle those just for the comment section hate speech.	Before an opinion is published it must be moderated and if it contains hate speech then the writer will not be able to post it.
__label__noRel	I agree this would helpfilter some of the hate speech	I think it is important for people to be able to comment on newspapers websites, but I think there needs to be a way of moderating the comments section to prevent/remove hate speech.
__label__noRel	But what if the opinion of others infringes upon the rights of another. As much as we should all be able to express our opinion it shouldn't be at the expense of others.	I think with careful moderation, there's nothing wrong with keeping the comments section. Reddit is a fine example of extremely good moderation combined with bots that immediately remove content with insults and hatespeech.
__label__noRel	I agree that anybody being allowed to comment can give rise to fake news in comment sections	I think having moderators who check the comments and remove any that contain hate speech is the best way of reducing it.
__label__noRel	Free speech should trump hate speech because hate speech can also be interpreted as political speech where by dissent of the prevailing political and cultural agendas are not accepted or an attempt is made to use "hate speech" to create a stigma around political agendas that are unpopular.	By a combination of monitoring and blocking people who leave such comments, and also having suitable laws in place to back this up
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	I agree. Users should be able to to flag harmful comments and report them to a moderator. Users can also counteract damaging comments by refuting the content of the comment, for example, by refering to reliable sources	there must be a code of conduct which is publicly accessible to write a comment. comment themselves could have button on where any other person could consider the comment to behateful with a points system in place
__label__noRel	Reductions in violations	we can reduce hate speech by blocking out certain words so that it can not be viewed publicly. and blocking the user using hate speech
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	The algorithm should have code that detects certain hate speech words and shadow bans them so as they do not appear on the site. with a warning that it will happen if the post is posted.
__label__noRel	If such a thing can be created then it could work well	I think the best way to reduce hate speech in newspaper websites is to ensure that the site can detect words and phrases that can be considered hate speech, and block them from being posted on the comment section. Also, a moderator to approve each comment section before it becomes publicly accessible is a notion which can be adopted as well.
__label__noRel	I agree	I disagree. Comments might be useful for users and also the owners of the newspapers. Though, asking people to identify themselves when registering could help reduce hate speech, as people would not be able to do whatever they want anonymously.
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	in my opinion there should be no comment section , article should be true and commenting no needed
__label__noRel	Passing hateful speeches is not basic right of freedom of speech, rather you are checking how peoples comment could affect society.

__label__noRel	This will not stop hate speech	I believe hate speech should be moderated and perhaps shadow-banned. That way users who post comments which are marked by the moderators as hate speech would never know they were banned and would not create new accounts or post more hateful comments.

__label__noRel	i agree, freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences and those who peddle hate speech should be punished	I believe removing the comment section is not a solution and that it actually encourages hate speech
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	In my opinion the comment section should not be removed. I personally get very annoyed if I watch or read something and want to express my opinion, then go down to the comment section to sadly find out the comments are turned off. This limits the freedom of speech and blocks the ability for the people to vent out somehow. I think this builds aggression and causes problems afterwards. The better thing to do is to limit bad speech, foul words and cursing but removing the comments completely is not a good idea.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	In today's world where technology has advanced to such a degree, I'm of the belief that creating parameters that protect individuals from any form of hate speech is very much possible through things such as AI. The removing of commenting sections could be argued as a violation to one's freedom of speech, it also means the views and opinions of the public will be lost which could have detrimental effects.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Strict moderation of comments prior to them being published may be the only way to limit hate speech on comments sections.

Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	other points of view should always be welcomed	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__noRel	This is true, moreover as it is said in this article https://medium.com/@flytedesk/the-pros-and-cons-of-removing-a-website-comment-section-9bea62f8e42b, removing a comment section might be thought by some users as a going against free speech and they will also spend less time on the website, leading to worse performances of the brand/website.	It has been shown that comments sections are popular and do drive traffic to websites and make people spend more time on the site (so pleasing advertisers) So from a commercial/publishing point of view it would seem that some kind of moderation is the best way to deal with the problem and not eliminate the section altogether.

As much as I hope and believe people should not resort to hate speech, but rather have a civilized conversation and respect each other's opinions, I am aware people might simply not be capable of that.

Quote from Wikipedia: "While "hate speech" is not a legal term in the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that most of what would qualify as hate speech in other western countries is legally protected free speech under the First Amendment."

I think this decision by the newspaper turned into an entire discussion of manageability of monitoring discussion sections and away from the ethical considerations.
__label__noRel	I think people are so wary of giving personal information out online that this would put people off commenting and while this might deter 'keyboard warriors' who are happy to hide behind a screen I dont think it would be helpful to have the threat of being tracked down.

An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	If newspapers did not allow interaction and went back to old school 1 way news, they would die out, nobody uses that anynore	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__noRel	The newspapers will not get to know how people realy feel about the issue at hand if the comment space is closed. The dialogue will be one sided	Addressing hate speech should not mean prohibiting freedom of speech which is what you will be doing if the comments' section is removed. Instead a way to reduce the hate speech from escalating into something dangerous must be sourced and implemented. https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/UN%20Strategy%20and%20Plan%20of%20Action%20on%20Hate%20Speech%2018%20June%20SYNOPSIS.pdf
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	I think that any 'contributors' should have a profile and should not be allowed to use an alias. I also think that there should be moderators looking at every post before it is published online.
__label__noRel	agreed, but sometimes trolls know full well the damage they do so there is a subset of people that it is impossible to have fair discussion with because they only want to provoke negative reactions	By educating people that not everything written in newspapers is true, they should egnore some information
__label__noRel	I agree, education is the best way in stopping this in the future https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/impact-and-prevention/preventive-role-of-education	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	In an ideal world perhaps, but how would you recognise 'hate speech' and police this in practical terms without infringing civil liberties and free speech. AI offers one avenue, but many challenges remain and there are many risks with this approach: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0221152	I don't believe removing the comment section will help remove hate speech, but having a system that can track the device and the people that use that device can go a long way in removing trolls from a community platform and prevent them from becoming repeat offenders.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	Have human and AI to verify potential hateful speech. Given our current resources we should be able to allocate a human check given the rating of the flag by the AI
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	One user by the name of AndreaP said in order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section Newspapers should be one sided providers. I strongly disagree with this argument. It is very autocratic and happens a lot in countries where media and citizens does not have freedom and oppressed by harsh leadership. Comments in newspapers help many to get raw information from the ground and open minds of many to see issues differently from differing opinions. Indeed comments section are necessary
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	By putting in a classing program that will read and class information as it enters. That way things will work nicely and we wont see more of hate speech
__label__noRel	Calling on the denegration on other people is not "Having an opinion" your view is your own, and you can have it, however when that overlaps into criticising other people for no other reason than they are differrent is not a "view", it is bigotry. So there needs to be some form of moderation.	Letting individuals know that as soon as someone comments, that is no longer confidential and if it is hate speech they shall be reported to authorities
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	The difficulty with moderation is that it is subjective - if done so via human moderation if there is no existing framework to follow particular viewpoints or comments may not be seen to be worthy of removing though for others this may not be the case. If moderating is done so by filtering words or with no human intervention, over-moderation is a risk. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2056305119832588
__label__noRel	My concern is that comments could be flagged as inappropriate in bad faith e.g. to shut down the opinions of those people disagree with even if the comments are not inappropriate or hateful	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	The pros of removing comment sections would be to eradicate the spreadof hate speech. Certain individuals thrive on adding fuel to fire. In this case having the comment section deleted would be a positive thing. On the other hand only by having differing opinions can discussions and debates happen. So if someone spews hate speech only then can we see the extent to which someone disagrees with a certain group/viewpoint etc. https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea
__label__noRel	-links showing other sites are a great way to show hateful infos in a coversation	My position as a reader and my argument is that bases on the rules of speech people have freedom of speech and expression. That should be done in a proper way without insulting others or hating or being racist in your speech. Websites and newspapers should not remove the comments of the people responding to hate speech. This is done according to the rules found in the following article: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	i am totally against any form of censorship in newspaper comment sections
__label__noRel	Technology should be able to parse out hate speech which has no room in any argument	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	I totally agree with this idea, this would still allow for comments on newspaper websites while at the same time addressing the issue of online hate speech.	they should monitor all comments and block people that post hate comments or censor certain hate words
__label__noRel	Newspapers role is already to sell information, censorship can be done without doing comments with hate speech.	The problem with moderating means that people may have a stance on what counts as a hate comment and may cause differing opinions and deletions of stuff that may just be outside someone's comfort zone https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793
__label__noRel	Must include specialist training for moderators as well.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	I agree, the comment section should likely remain but be heavily moderated and regulated to disallow hate speech as the article above says	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	Algorithms are not always accurate	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	What you are suggesting means that free speech should be limited to those articles that won't generate a conversation. If you look at https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/10/news-sites-that-turn-off-commenting-dont-drive-users-to-social-media-instead/ it shows that restricting or reducing comments can inflame a situation and cause irrational and trolling.	Block known accounts with a history of hate speech
__label__noRel	I think this is a good idea, but people have a way of getting around these filters by using different fonts or characters that cannot be read by the filter bots.	By utilising AI so that it can look for certain words that could be deemed offensive.
__label__noRel	yes true i find no one really reads those comments anyways	I believe that with real time moderation , if the comments can be removed before causing any distress to people then this is a better option than removing the ability to make comments.
__label__noRel	I agree, it should not be removed but rather directed	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	Totally agree . Users all human beings after all
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	We can reduce hate speech by having it moderated
__label__noRel	Having moderators filter out bad words or comments that contain hate speech would do so much good. This allows everybody to comment their opinion but remove those that are hateful and disrespectful.	I don't think we can police websites 100% but if comments are moderated I think we can reach quite a high degree of compliance
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	No one can be informed about the debate - just the newspapers view - which in and of itself will be from their point of view	I agree with the notion that being able to share our thoughts and feelings is a right and having people share their views can help people to question their own thoughts. The inclusion of moderators to prevent people from posting discriminatory or harmful comments would be good, but difficult to ensure these moderators aren't biased towards one argument
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	Moderating comments could be a viable solution. The use of AI could make it easier given that there could be thousands and thousands of comments, too much for human moderator/s to keep track of.
__label__noRel	We live in a democratic country and so, everyone is entitled to their opinion.	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	What is considered free speech (and should therefor be allowed) depends heavily on the location of the platform and the user. In the US free speech is protected by law to a much greater extend than in Europe. In the US there are only a few categories of speech not protected by the First Amendment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_free_speech_exceptions), like incitement to lawless action. In Europe however free speech stops there where it infringes on someone else their rights, for example the right to not be discriminated against. Racism and targeted hate for that reason is not protected by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights) or the national laws of many of the European countries.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	This dos seem a little harsh, a little negativity will push you to greatness. I am for moderation.	Monitoring of comment areas is not realistic
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	It may be a good idea to involve some form of moderators to check if there are any hate speeches. Aggressive comments may be censored accordingly. However, we need to be careful in doing this as some may have negative effect as silencing voices.
__label__noRel	hate speech i s not related to freedom of speech	Awareness campaigns need to be implemented to teach people about the significance of avoiding hate speech.
__label__noRel	Newspapers should be neutral, but you find that they are often the ones who actually instigate hate speech	The use of admins and moderators can be helpful in removing hate speech. They would need strict rules for the public in order to not let their own personal biases judge what is and isn't considered hate speech.
__label__noRel	i agree. it is not a permanent solution	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	b	This is something that I think is impossible to do. One can never ever be sure of people s intensions. I don't believe newspaper websites should even have space for readers comments , there are other platforms where readers can express themselves
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	Filter words so if a comment contains this word it will be reviewed as to if it is appropriate or automatically deleted
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	I'm a firm believer of freedom of speech therefore eliminating it in any form especially because of something that can be regulated like hate speech, to me is ridiculous.
__label__noRel	everyone should be entitled to free speech	The author of the post can moderate all comments before allowing them on the page. This does present the issue that only the author's views will be portrayed
__label__noRel	This is unlikely to be feasible. United states courts have repeatedly upheld a right to anonymity in this context: https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/why-ending-anonymity-would-not-make-social-media-better.php	There are other ways to reduce or block hateful comments without having to eliminate comment section.
__label__noRel	You're trusting an algorithm that would need to be trained by humans - so the AI itself could still be biased.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Moderator cannot always be reliable	you cannot eliminate it. dont try. freedom of speech is importante and we must appreciae others have different view
__label__noRel	I agree	Ensuring there are rules to adhere to, perhaps muting certain offensive words or phrases. Making sure commnect sections are heavily monitored.
__label__noRel	Under current laws, restauranters are responsible for hate speech among their diners, so I certainly think platform owners should be responsible for the presence of hate speech on their websites. Hate speech is a criminal offence, after all.	Having a screaning for all comments before they go up on the platform to make sure that they are not posted on the site.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	I know this has been discussed a few times potentially in reply to comments but I'd like to repeat it again: language is complex and you can't simply ban or flag certain terms or phrases and think you catch all the hate speech comments etc. While a report button and the use of a software that can support a human moderator is in essence a good idea, it might also delete comments that do not actually contain HS or completely miss others overall. I think this decision by the newspaper turned into an entire discussion of manageability of monitoring discussion sections and away from the ethical considerations.
__label__noRel	Yes but it can also reduce the preaching of misinformation and hateful ideologies	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	I have read through some of the cooments and my stance is still the same. It is no doubt that hate speech is a problem, however, not allowing the public the opportunity to comment on issues may not only be a problem against freedom of speech, it may also cause the newspaper to lose some of its loyal readers if they're not able to engage with the content shared by the newspaper.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think and AI could filter this faster than a person. Also giving people to opportunity to report will help as well.	I think there has to be a system that can verify whether a person's comment contains hate speech and if it is found to contain hate speech, that person should not be allowed to leave the comment.

__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it.

I still think a filtering system of removing categorically hateful words could help a little, but there is still the big problem of other comments bypassing that. I think an independant and unbiased moderation team could help to remove the issue of the newspapers removing valid critisism or comments about inaccurate reporting for example.
__label__noRel	I can't see how this would work, it would still happen regardless of the size of the comments senction	"Freedom of Speech'...that's a popular consensus among the masses, regardless of the "casualities" that are left on the wayside.

HOWEVER, let there be consequences involved, such as naming and shaming, and acquring user details if need be, after all, things such as cyber crime, online harrassment, etc do exist, am I right?

__label__noRel	I totally agree. There are people who like to read comments. It is also a right to express an opinion.	There is a careful balance to be made between protecting others from the effects of hate speech and protecting free speech. Online hate speech unfortunately can have the effect of increasing violence against minorities (https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons) but blocking all free speech because of the actions of a few seems like a poor decision. More must be done to remove hate speech online quickly and this means spending more money tackling it.

__label__noRel	I believe that punishment would cause more polarization because people may have more negative feelings towards newspaper websites with comments sections. Like what AllisonK said, education is a better preventative measure. If punishment is necessary, it should involve education that the commentator actively engages in.	The newspaper website platform owners should be held accountable for any hate speech that occurs on their website and they can combat hate speech allowing fellow readers to be able to flag/report posts that they deem hateful.The moderators can then investigate.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it.

I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	I think that is a very good idea	Firstly, newspapers need to enact a proper system of moderation. Blocking all comments infringes on free speech and does not allow readers to provide a counterpoint to the position provided in the article.
__label__noRel	Moderators could be biased on subjective in their opinions.	It is important that people are able to have a voice, especially as it can be a great tool in educating people, and giving people a variety of viewpoints that they wouldn't necessarily get to often hear. Sometimes we learn best by hearing and understanding the views of other people. We don't have to necessarily change our opinions, but it can help us become more aware of why or how people feel a certain way about things.
__label__noRel	I like to see comments with people who think like me	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	They might sift a bit	Maybe filter through comments
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Hate speech poses grave dangers for the cohesion of a democratic society. It can lead to acts of violence and conflict on a wider scale.
__label__noRel	Absolutely, we should support hate speech or encourage it by allowing multiple infractions to be pass by unpunished.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__noRel	True, creates a hurdle that some people don't wanna do	Implementing a software that detects comments including hate speech, like the ones on social networks. Also including a report button for poeple to report hate speech comments
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	By introducing a cyber bullying detecting software

__label__noRel	If opinions are given it should be clear they are opinions and not facts.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	In as much as we can not let the spread of hate speech continue, closing the comment section is not the solution. The newspaper website should have the option for readers to be able to report comments that include hate speech and moderators should be appointed to check "users" that are violating the rules. There can be filters in place that remove posts that have some of the common hateful and derogatory phrases. outlining the rules and regulations for the website users can help

I strongly disagree with this argument. It is very autocratic and happens a lot in countries where media and citizens does not have freedom and oppressed by harsh leadership.

__label__noRel	I agree	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	Someone has had to code that algorithm so it is already bias. Comments need a team of diverse moderators	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	Absolutely, if you are discussing the topic at hand - articles are meant to engage readers and grab their attention.	The words chosen to be used are very essential when in comes to the reader and a writer. The content that is viewed as a hate speech should not be shown to the other readers. It should automatically give a warning to the writer and after 3 warnings they should be blocked as they do not comply with the terms and conditions.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	1. Only allow verified accounts to post - these accounts should be easily traced back to individuals. 2. Moderate comments with both algorithms and human visibility. 3. Prosecute.
__label__noRel	I firmly agree. Comment sections need to be regulated not banned. Rules need to be put in place on what will be considered as hate speech with that,the consequences of part taking in the said hate speech.	There is a fine line between free speech and hate speech. I don't think there is any way to reduce this because people will take the stand and say that their free speech is being taken away from them.
__label__noRel	But proper moderation is difficult to achieve.	https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons
__label__noRel	This would reduce hate speech and overall help to ensure a promote positive environment	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Just allow people to report bad comments and when it gets to a certain number it should delete the message and send an automatic email to the person who wrote it with a warning.

__label__noRel	Deplatforming and deleting contentis effective when it comes to content moderation. https://www.greens-efa.eu/files/assets/docs/alternative_content_web.pdf	Having read through the opinions of others, my stance has not completely changed. It is important to censor comments, freedom of speech does not always equate to disrespecting the views and opinions of others. While I agree that comments should be censored, I do not agree that every comment should be removed. As mentioned before, a system can be implemented that removes comments with certain words, thus making the comment section a safe space for all who use it.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	Freedom of speech can be used as catch-all term to justify the use and propagation of bigoted and hateful language. If we accept that some language is not acceptable due to it's clearly hateful nature then we have to acknowledge that some form of censorship of those particular instances has to occur. I would suggest that eliminating all such spaces from newspaper websites would have a massive detrimental effect on valid, non-bigoted, freedom of speech a cornerstone of western life. We don't ban all cars because some people speed dangerously, we monitor the roads and ban the bad drivers. I suggest that as long as readers comments are monitored continually they should remain.
__label__noRel	Exactly correct, there's no evidence to show removal or prohibition of user commentary actually reduces hate speech. Users simply find alternative means to express their thoughts. If you're aware of the popular meme 'in minecraft' illustrates this principle in its rudimentary form.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	If 99 out of 100 people are having a normal civilised debate, 1 'troll' can muddy the waters of the whole community, without some vetting of posts it would be a mess	I don't think it's helpful to cancel the comment space completely, we should have the ability to post our thoughts.
__label__noRel	But it also means that the newspaper will have full control over what is being posted and can filter certain opinions as well as hate speech to create a biased community look if they want to. Since they would never go on air, there would be no history of the page you can compare to.	Removing the comment section should not be an option, we should not lose the right to freedom of speech based on the likelihood that a few may post hateful comments, strict moderation and being able to report hate speech is the solution. Having people sign up for platforms and use ID to which they could be held personally accountable is an option as well. Hate Speech often comes from being able to hide behind a keyboard, screen and a fake username.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	The technical team of the newspaper should select comments that don't promote hate speech and make those comments the only ones that are going to appear on the newspaper's websites.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/19/npr-comments-decision-guardian-readers
__label__noRel	I agree that Comments should we posted then flagged by the public. If it has a certain number of flags it should then be reviewed.

__label__noRel	the comment section can actually be a platform for bullying other people and hence it is a solution . removing it will limit publication of the hate speech	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated.

__label__noRel	I like the idea of controversial opinions still being available to see other perspectives, but not being forced to see them if you don't want to.	Comment space encourages discussion of important topics and allows free exchange of information and so should not be eliminated. Independent moderators should be used in order to ensure that hate speech is quickly deleted and encourage users to express their ideas without using inappropriate or aggressive language.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	We live in a democratic society and so people have the right to their opinions. They just need to be voiced in the right way
__label__noRel	if No more trolls, political copy-pastes, or general rudeness and anger are in comments i think both sides of arguement/opinion can be heard.	One mainstream way of mitigating hate speech on online comment sections is to pre-moderate comments. This however may lead to a 'biased' viewpoint.

__label__noRel	the same as my idea	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	while free speech is our right and we are entitled to our own opinions, when you are promoting/endorsing hatred and discrimination of any sort, the line should be drawn. having a discussion/debate with opposing sides is normal and gives insight to both sides with little bias, but that cannot be used as an excuse to be hateful or discriminatory.

__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	I would almost agree that removing the comments would be beneficial. I've very rarely seen a comment on an article that actually contributed towards learning more about the content. It's typically just people yelling they don't agree without any true thought.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.

Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	I am unsure if there is a way to reduce hate speech.

Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them.

When it comes to bullying, cyberbullying, harassment, and hate crimes, the more people are educated on these issues, the more we can prevent them in the future.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.

But, all they find it few people engaging in a verbal war which is uncalled for.	The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is often used as a reason not to have readers comments. It seems that this is not a fair argument for eliminating readers comments because of the psychological phenomenon of "cognitive dissonance" - we automatically search for echo chambers in any context.
__label__noRel	I disagree because it is still tolerating that intolerant people express themselves and make their opinions visible. Even if they are removed,it will take a while for that to happen and this hateful message may have already found an echo in another bigot.

It would also be beneficial to have a human supervisor from the organisation and another external body review the activities of the AI to ensure accuracy and consistency.
__label__noRel	but the amount of comments is what puts too much of a strain on moderators	they need to as often it is minorities which are affected
__label__noRel	I agree. Considering much of this hate speech comes from bots it is impossible to keep up with it. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20563051221104749	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I think sharing ideas is ultimately beneficial and having a space to do this can help form stronger opinions. Hearing different sides of an argument and different perspectives help ensure that we are considering many views and not hyper focused on one narrative that may not be the reality of other people.	This article made me reflect on the definition of hate speech and I aggree with blocking comments that go against a persons protected characteristics - if a comment like that is made, it should instantly be banned from the platform / comment section. https://about.fb.com/news/2017/06/hard-questions-hate-speech/
__label__noRel	Free speech is very important, but newspapers also has a responsibilty to ensure hate speech is not spread through their comment section.	Newspapers should have an algorithm that catches certain words or phrases which are hateful in nature. These words will be automatically flagged up and accounts that are flagged x amount of times should then be restricted from commenting for a period of time. If after this period, they continue to try and post comments with hateful content, they should be banned entirely from commenting.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	to reduce hate speech it is important to raise the stakes of what happens if you are caught. scientific evidence and criminological theory shows that if someone perceives greater risk in their actions, they are more likely to desist.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	Through active moderation.
__label__noRel	The public are not experts and their views should not be publicised as such.	Agreeing with others here: a standard of moderation would have to be communicated to the user, with straightforward policies of flagging or reporting potentially hateful comments. A synthesis of live and algorithmic moderators might be best, as certain words can be auto-flagged for review, whereas other things might involve a more delicate touch.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	The key way to do it would be with very in-depth moderation which is non-biased and respects criticisms but its aware when a comment is taken too far and viewed as hate speech. the comment section should not be eliminated but mainly moderated and supervised
__label__noRel	yes. good moderators are the key	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	agree, the news could start selling fake information if the comment section would be removed	The most effective way would be to produce effective and fair algorithms that can detect use of hate speech along with help of human moderation.
__label__noRel	Banning hate speech will radicalize people who will only feel more oppressed by the opposition trying to silence them.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	Trolls don't really care about anything but trolling so trying to reason with them is futile.	up to this point, moderators have done a poor job as evidenced by the amount of hate speech so maybe the answer is simply to remove the ability to comment.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.

__label__noRel	Hate speech must be moderated otherwise we are teaching future generation that is it acceptable	I think that moderation is the most effective way of preventing hate speech. Filtering comments would not work as it is difficult to find a algorithm for the context of a comment. Free speech is so important it should not be removed.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	This should be done with a mix of moderation, community flagging and reporting before moving to disabling comments, based ona mix of moderative judgement and amount of flagging
__label__noRel	totally agree	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	Sadly I must agree. Ongoing monitoring of comments would take too much effort and time. It is simpler to just remove the comments and let the newspaper articles stand for themselves. Pople can always link the article to their own twitter post and comment there if they feel the need to add their own thoughts.	Ensuring there are rules to adhere to, perhaps muting certain offensive words or phrases. Making sure commnect sections are heavily monitored.
__label__noRel	I Disagree, modern software technology is capable of knowing when to filter out post being made by the public. A system can be integrated as too where if a post achieves a certain threshold of flagged/reported tickets; there post would and can be immediately shut down.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	I disagree. Removing the comments section is limiting access to echo chambers, quite literally.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated.

__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	I am unsure if there is a way to reduce hate speech. One persons 'hate speech' is anothers 'freedom of speech'. As a supposedly democratic nation, we need to be able to permit people from all walks of lives and experiences to air their own personal views, whether these are educated views or not.

I think that fully blocking comments being allowed is detrimental to free speech, therefore comments should be allowed. However, there should be monitoring and banning of certain individuals if they are found to be continually hateful towards others.
__label__noRel	There is clear evidence of the efficacy of different moderation practices because these have been used on various sites for years now.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.

__label__noRel	That's a very valid point	appreciate people have different views
__label__noRel	How are moderators fairly decided upon? Would newspapers choose moderators who would enforce their political ideology? I think this is a quick road to platform-controlled censorship.	There needs to be a moderator who is reviewing the comments that are made, I see a lot of inappropriate comments posted to news stories on the comments section of the news articles on facebook that incite arguments and hate speech. This is not acceptable and should not be allowed to happen.

__label__noRel	Do you believe that a newspaper comment section is an appropriate system for dialogue with someone spreading hateful messages?	I think there should at least be a 'report' button and any hate speech reported should be removed.
__label__noRel	This would reduce the risk of hate speech.	I agree with the notion that being able to share our thoughts and feelings is a right and having people share their views can help people to question their own thoughts. The inclusion of moderators to prevent people from posting discriminatory or harmful comments would be good, but difficult to ensure these moderators aren't biased towards one argument

If someone wants to just use a racist term or promote their website, then these people's comment should be removed and they should be banned from commenting for a period of time. The idea to remove comments entirely is absurd as the news is not trustworthy enough to be the sole voice people hear. We need to hear other voices.
__label__noRel	I completely agree, it will help avoid people posting offensive comments and allow the comment section space to be a space of productiveness where we learn what our fellow communities think about articles posted	i think a law should be made that if you do not delete hate speech from your website or article than that newspaper will have to pay a fine.

__label__noRel	civility is better!	Overall I think I agree with some of the mentions that removing the comments section does reduce freedom of speech. We should be allowed to comment and share opinions on any topic as long as it isn't hate speech.

Regulations of comment sections has been proven with various other platforms to be the best solution. When there are clear rules put in place regarding what should be considered as hate speech and the consequences of the part taking in such could lead to eg. A ban from the being able to comment for a certain period of time.
__label__noRel	I believe having the ability to read through the comments of other is very important when making decisions. The fact that monitoring is weak across most platforms is the biggest issue.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	Hate speech will forever be a problem in society and its up to the newspapers website to make sure they publish newsworthy news that even if they come across negative comments, they know that on their side their story is true and there a no loopholes

We should all have the option to voice our opinion. If doing so can result in hate speech, then we have to find a way to fight it instead of trying to eliminate comments altogether. Flagging certain words or using algorithms could potentially could help hide comments that don't add any value and are just trying to cause harm
__label__noRel	this literally defeats the point of the internet. We stopped being passive consumers a while ago, and removing the ability to express your opinion is moving back instead of forward.	I agree that moderating the comment section with flagged phrases that automatically send comments for quick moeration would be a good solution.
__label__noRel	Unfortunately, people do seem to struggle with self-censorship, especially when anonymous and hidden behind a keyboard.	I think removing the comment space is just avoiding the problem. There can be interesting and thoughtful comments and we would miss from them. Newspapers websites should instead try to regulate the comment space by introducing a bot or hiring appropriate moderators or there should be some punishment to discourage the use of hate speech.
__label__noRel	The moderation can be subject to the Moderator's own thoughts/opinions.	Hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by educating people about the consequences of hate speech and what they can do to someone else.
__label__noRel	Yes, algorithms developed alongside the countries law makers and governing bodies could help reduce legally defined hate speech without making room for petty vendetas or the silencing of free speech.	The question is? Is hate speech not part of free speech? I think people should be left to express themselves however they feel is appropriate as long as they are not breaking an laws
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed.

I doubt not letting them comment will make it any worse	If we are to ban everyone who post a hateful comment we would be infringing on their basic right of freedom of speech.

__label__noRel	I think these people will then keep living in their own bubble and will never learn that their philosophy isn't normal.	It hink a moderation is required for hate speech. Removing the entire comment section is not an ideal option. However, hate speech is alsoa crime. It is clear that there should be some monitoring in social media in terms of tracking down the user when necessary so similar terms with the real world would be valid. If you make a crime in real word you get you will stand trial so similar option should be valid for social media.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	This is very sensible.	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__noRel	I disagree. Would you like to read a newspaper filled with hate speech just because they are not in charge of identifying what is hate speech or not?	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	No hate speech	I think that someone should be assigned as a moderator who assesses comments before they are posted to ensure they don't contain any offensive information
__label__noRel	It's true that this would eliminate hate speech	Hate speech should not be allowed to dominate the narrative as it defeats the process and hinders effective communication. As a result, flagging and blocking of problematic accounts can prove to be effective in combating the spread of hate speech.
__label__noRel	Newspapers operate under their own distinct ownership and can thus set their own policies. Stores have their own methods of queuing for product, concert venues have their own methods of admitting attendees. Sites have no obligation to allow unsupervised public discourse.	in my opinion there should be no comment section , article should be true and commenting no needed
__label__noRel	I agree, and this can be further enocouraged if the writerr or journalist engages with the comments that are being made on their story	Hate comments are always not good for any person
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	Freedpn of speech doesnt mean you must promote hate speech on newspapers, it basically means you free to voice out your concerns in around society in a more respectfull manner.
__label__noRel	This is true, moreover as it is said in this article https://medium.com/@flytedesk/the-pros-and-cons-of-removing-a-website-comment-section-9bea62f8e42b, removing a comment section might be thought by some users as a going against free speech and they will also spend less time on the website, leading to worse performances of the brand/website.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	i think these ideas would be the way forward and i agree	Readers should not be given a false assumption on the understandings of others.
__label__noRel	Would probably be very hard to actually do anything about people posting hateful comments	The only possible way to reduce hate speech is to have some kind of algorithm that may recognise certain words and phrases. Other than that it would mean moderating the comment section.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	other points of view should always be welcomed	Filter words so if a comment contains this word it will be reviewed as to if it is appropriate or automatically deleted
__label__noRel	Without the option for comments, the news providers become the sole voice of an opinion.	Hate speech should not be allowed to dominate the narrative as it defeats the process and hinders effective communication. As a result, flagging and blocking of problematic accounts can prove to be effective in combating the spread of hate speech.
__label__noRel	Readers should be able to challenge the editorial views of the newspaper / individual journalist otherwise the newspaper just becomes an echo chamber.	Newspapers should be a pleasure to read and not make you angry after reading comments not having comments will make them more pleasurable to read again.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Have a moderator than overlooks all readers comments and makes sure they're all suitable.
__label__noRel	I appreciate the balance here.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	the website should have terms and conditions on the words that can be used and warnings if failure to follow the recommended words .
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	I think you could ban some words or have someone checking the comments and deleting the ones that are unappropiate, but limiting the whole comment section would be a mistake
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	This reduces free speech and lets the negative win	Although it might be unfair for others, I think majority can agree that removing the comment section will be helpful because then it means anyone that has an opinion can rather call the newspaper.
__label__noRel	Free speech has a limit, and there is no reason why people should be allowed to post hate speech online.	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I am pretty sure some sort of hate speech itself is an infringement of ones human right and somehow defies what democracy stands for so it still does not lead to the necessary democracy either	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	I agree having an algorithm to delete specific words and phrases.	By monitoring individual responses and removing those not deemed suitable for publication
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	This is probably the optimal solution, but it also requires a lot of work force and might be quite expensive, too.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	In today's world where technology has advanced to such a degree, I'm of the belief that creating parameters that protect individuals from any form of hate speech is very much possible through things such as AI. The removing of commenting sections could be argued as a violation to one's freedom of speech, it also means the views and opinions of the public will be lost which could have detrimental effects.
__label__noRel	I feel this could lead to propagating false information through inclusion of poorly researched urls.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree, if we were to allow the public to have 'freedom of speech' We need to ensure someone who is unbiased can remove the comments that will only fuel hatred and not give a well structured opinion a chance.	The key way to do it would be with very in-depth moderation which is non-biased and respects criticisms but its aware when a comment is taken too far and viewed as hate speech. the comment section should not be eliminated but mainly moderated and supervised
__label__noRel	Removing comment sections on newspapers, enables limited misinformation and discrimination to reproduce.	Comment sections need to be well-moderated, and if algoritmic or user comment flagging is used this needs to also be reviewed by a human moderator to ensure that there is no bias or bad faith reporting going on.
__label__noRel	I agree	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by educating people about the consequences of hate speech and what they can do to someone else.
__label__noRel	who decides how the moderators moderate? This is too much power	In today's world where technology has advanced to such a degree, I'm of the belief that creating parameters that protect individuals from any form of hate speech is very much possible through things such as AI. The removing of commenting sections could be argued as a violation to one's freedom of speech, it also means the views and opinions of the public will be lost which could have detrimental effects.
__label__noRel	Who would do this?	In order to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. Active communinty management and moderation is required. This helps keep people in line with the community guildelines.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	You can reduce hate speech by moderating the comments, banning repeating offenders and requiring a phone number to create a account.
__label__noRel	If your opinion degrades or harms an individual it is not needed. Removing it is the best option	Alternatively I'd offer the opinion that goes against the question and states that we shouldn't offer a space for readers comments (and thus hate speech) at all on news since it's primarily a site and source for news. Systems like https://ground.news/ have been providing news and removing bias without a social aspect already and since third party social/sharing/commentary sites handle discussion and the problem of hate speech far better than newspaper websites presumably can hope to, the solution seems intuitive: remove it and let that happen organically on other websites and platforms.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	By outright banning IP addresses which contribute hate speech to platforms, and investing in moderation through human resources and through text analysis tools.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	Ideally comment section should not be available on newspaper to reduce hate speech
__label__noRel	it would take a lot of time before the news are released	There should be a strict comment management system in place, someone has to supervise it and react (and possibly penalise) to users spreading hate speech. The comments should not be anonymous since people feel more inclined to be hostile when hiding under a pseudonym. Maybe asking to verify your identity before posting a comment would make people think more before spreading hate.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	Websites should invest in software to remove hate speech, this would allow for healthy debate without racist or descrimination.
__label__noRel	there's always going to be some sort of criticism of freedom of speech	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__noRel	It could be damaging for allinvo	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__noRel	Removing all comments as a blanket measure is appropriate as it moves the conversations to other spaces. Newspapers should be for news, objective, they are no place for opinions	This should be done with a mix of moderation, community flagging and reporting before moving to disabling comments, based ona mix of moderative judgement and amount of flagging
__label__noRel	It doesn't give a space for hate speech	One way I propose to prevent hate speech is to remove anonymity online. Not being able to hide should limit cowardly behavior and thus reduce harmful speech.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	I think it is ok to remove the comments. There are other places people can go to express opinions.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	I agree with most of the commenters here, there needs to be moderation. Even if you don't agree with the arguments there are ways of saying it that do not fall into 'hate speech'.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	By allowing a section that briefly educates the viewers regarding the situation before they even get to the part of comment sections.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Flag known and "popular" derogatory terms automatically through the platform which does not allow you to post the comment without using the politically correct terms
__label__noRel	more teachers needed	It is important for people to voice their opions so I do not thik this discussion is fair, however I do agree that comments should be moderated. The readers should also be made aware of the rules that apply to commenting with regards to hateful speech.
__label__noRel	Firtly, i think the newpaper need to acknowledge the concern of hate speech. And is importnant because we can never fully avoid it. So the newspaper should have a platform support people who are targets of hate speech.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	That will take too long time to do manually, so it's best to ban some words in the start. If the user is using to many of the banned words, then ban the user automatically.	ALthough the idea of free speech is important, it cannot be used as an excuse to upset others and use racist/sexist/ violent language.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	There should be repercussions to extensive hate speech e.g a limited ban to the forum etc. Use moderators and ensure that users understand the consequences of hate speech commente
__label__noRel	People are entitled to an opinion that isn't hateful or intended to harm a person.	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	How do people exercise freedom of speech?	I dont think it is a fair choice. For how long should people be silenced. Hate speech is always going to be around. Shutting people up is not going to stop hate speech.
__label__noRel	However it could be argued that t it is so difficult for moderators to see the difference between someone practicing their freedom of speech and the idea of hate speech against a protected characteristic.	The only way to combat hate speech is through open debate. Restricting any form of speech (even hate speech) could lead to hateful views becoming unchallenged and potentially result in violence. There is also the issue that newspapers could define hate speech as certain comments they don't like destroying any potential for open debate. By maintaining open debate hate speech can be called out and as a result, become less frequent.
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	I dont think it is a fair choice. For how long should people be silenced. Hate speech is always going to be around. Shutting people up is not going to stop hate speech.

__label__noRel	That's a very good point and thanks for pointing out what it's called. I learned something new today! I have seen countless times in anti (fill in blank) groups that use asterisks and other characters to write out otherwise blocked words. They get around the system.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others.

__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	Filter the comments so that any with known hate speech terms cant be posted. Make sure people sign in to make comments etc
__label__noRel	You rely on readers actually flagging inappropriate comments and not just comments that they don't like	I disagree with the stance of doing away with the comment section in its entirety, it goes against the premise of media which is to spark a debate or discussion.

__label__noRel	This would create issues of illegibility and would only create more confusion as to the user's intent when the comment was made.	The best way to reduce hate speech would be to make sure that moderators are present to check on comments, it would not be advisable to cancel comments completely due the feedback it gives and people will always have their opinions and sometimes they will involve hate speech, which is unavoidable...
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	I think filtering hate speech comments can do that and allowing a better more positive and a welcome experience to all readers.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	State that the editor is free to print or not print any comments, and his/hers is the final decision.
__label__noRel	I think that it should be the responsibility of the news outlets to ensure that comments are fair and accurate.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	I totally agree with you. Adding that the comment section must remain closed until the education of the people takes effect. Remembering that the learning process takes time to complete.	Having a comments section can be ideal to engage in a healthy debate but will need to monitored very strictly to ensure there is no bullying or one sided views be taken against any individuals

__label__noRel	everyone has the right to be heard	Firstly, newspapers need to enact a proper system of moderation. Blocking all comments infringes on free speech and does not allow readers to provide a counterpoint to the position provided in the article.
__label__noRel	I agree, everyone has freedom of speech but no should abuse it and use it using hate speech. Everybody should respect everyone's idea/opinion.	I definately think the way forward is to have moderators that will review all comments before they get posted.They can then approve or disapprove all the comments and flag inappropiate user names. Yiou could also add a way for the readers to flag inappropiate comments and these will also flag to the moderators.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	One way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for reader comments would to have active community managers who are activetly managing the comment section. Making sure that all comments are in accordance to the community guidelines.
__label__noRel	Yes, freedom of speech is very important in this day and age.	I agree that it all should be reviewed before it is published
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	Having moderators or AI to automatically remove content that includes keywords with cursing or inflammatory language, having a report/flag button so people can report and remove very offensive things
__label__noRel	people have freedom of speech. which they can reflect upon their actions	hate speech must be clearly defined, it should not be left to the media to decide what is and is not considered hate speech
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	The newspaper website platform owners should be held accountable for any hate speech that occurs on their website and they can combat hate speech allowing fellow readers to be able to flag/report posts that they deem hateful.The moderators can then investigate.

More control by moderators plus a code of conduct for users

Nowadays, with all other social medias available, the conversation can happen on platform made for dialogue. But as practice shows, those "conversations" are often very polarized and everyone is kind of screaming in a void.
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	there needs to be some form of ceneorship of what newspaper can post i dont mean full censorship i just mean around things realating to hate of certain group
__label__noRel	The right to free speech doesn't mean there should be no consequences for hate speech.	I think we should just collect personal information. It works in South Korea. People will behave if their are not anonymous. Modertors are important too, but not enough,
__label__noRel	Debate is important	comment sections should not be removed as that will prevent those with positive comments form sharing their thoughts, they should instead be reviewed regulary so that hate speech is flagged and removed another solution is for comments to be approved by moderators before they go public

__label__noRel	difficult to judge hate speech	people who comment hate speech should be banned
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	Increasing the monitoring of comments made on a post will prevent the propagation of dangerous viewpoints and scams performed on people as no control over the content published create spaces for this to take place.
__label__noRel	This will enable people to discuss freely	Before an opinion is published it must be moderated and if it contains hate speech then the writer will not be able to post it.

I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words.

__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.

__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	That would reduce hate speech	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	The panel would be biased in some way no matter how much the newspaper tries to remove bias.	It hink a moderation is required for hate speech. Removing the entire comment section is not an ideal option. However, hate speech is alsoa crime. It is clear that there should be some monitoring in social media in terms of tracking down the user when necessary so similar terms with the real world would be valid. If you make a crime in real word you get you will stand trial so similar option should be valid for social media.
__label__noRel	I agree we can work to prevent it, but systems can be complicated to introduce or can be controversial in themselves	exclude certain words from being posted

__label__noRel	I do not understand comment sections in newspapers., I wish to read the story from the author; having a vox populi of people I don't know serves no purpose to me. I agree with this poster that there are (or could be) other areas where people can place their opinions -if anybody is really interested!	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	Allowing people who have profiles with the website to comment. Anonymity should not be allowed. Information that is traceable to an individual could be implemented(even though may be intrusive) could be requested when creating a profile. Examples, a cellphone number that is FICAd , student number, loyalty card number and the like.
__label__noRel	I agree	Filter the comments so that any with known hate speech terms cant be posted. Make sure people sign in to make comments etc
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	Having moderators or AI to automatically remove content that includes keywords with cursing or inflammatory language, having a report/flag button so people can report and remove very offensive things
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Younger people are susceptible to propaganda by the establishment "elites", they will be easy targets of manipulation by saying that ALL opposing views are "hate speech".

Is it really hate speech or is it just an opinion that we don't want to hear?
__label__noRel	yes this is the best way to reduce hate speech while still allowing readers to comment their opinion	This is something that I think is impossible to do. One can never ever be sure of people s intensions. I don't believe newspaper websites should even have space for readers comments , there are other platforms where readers can express themselves
__label__noRel	Lack of accuracy due to reliance on tech, opportunities to get past algorithm	I believe if we can be on the same page and let the media tell the story the truth with out lashing out on it.
__label__noRel	This isnt a freedom of speech issue. That is only in relation to the govt not curtailing free speech. A private company... newspaper, has no obligation to allow you to freely air your views.	There should be some level of censoring to eliminate hate speech, but not to the extent where comments are totally disabled
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Some of the comment section of some newspaper articles are not worth reading and may sometimes spoil the reading experience. https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/
__label__noRel	True I totally agree. I think having certain policies in place before being able to comment will help. Look at this article here. on policies for internet companies https://www.americanprogress.org/article/curbing-hate-online-companies-now/	I think the best way is to block or censor certain words. Especially words that are synonymous with hate speech. Or better yet, have moderators in comments sections.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is often used as a reason not to have readers comments. It seems that this is not a fair argument for eliminating readers comments because of the psychological phenomenon of "cognitive dissonance" - we automatically search for echo chambers in any context.
__label__noRel	There needs to be some space to discuss the news to encourage conversation and fact checking.	Freedom of speech still has its limits!!
__label__noRel	Readers comments are an accountability tool for curation	Newspaper websites should implement ways such as word filters, moderators and more strict rules and regulations to prevent post that include hate speech to be minimised. They can also educate people about the dangers of hate speech. "Fight back against harmful messages in public places by publicly standing with victims in solidarity" https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/combat-onlin-hate-speech/
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	My position as a reader and my argument is that bases on the rules of speech people have freedom of speech and expression. That should be done in a proper way without insulting others or hating or being racist in your speech. Websites and newspapers should not remove the comments of the people responding to hate speech. This is done according to the rules found in the following article: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Agree with your suggestions. I had the same idea. However, there would need to be a way to get around mispellings of words to get around the blocked vocabulary.	maybe make the comment section questions and answers about the article so comments are stictley moderated
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	you cannot eliminate it. dont try. freedom of speech is importante and we must appreciae others have different view
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	Hate speech online absolutely must be eliminated and we should not encourage it within online platforms. Hate speech can and does lead to violence which is more severe than 'being horrible online'. https://www.coe.int/web/european-commission-against-racism-and-intolerance/hate-speech-and-violence
__label__noRel	It is important to actually define what hate speech is before an agreed education policy can be enacted.	Websites should invest in software to remove hate speech, this would allow for healthy debate without racist or descrimination.

__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	Readers should not be given a false assumption on the understandings of others.
__label__noRel	By holding them liabile it will remove negativity on the platform.	Like I mentioned previously,the need for artificial intelligence is vital and like what AliceW mentioned in hjer post that people needs to be educated about hate speech which I strongly support.I also think it is everyone's responsibility to educate each other the damage hate speech has to individuals and the society at large
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	There needs to be a fine balance between freedom of expression and stopping hate speech. The best way is for comments to be screened as that would still allow opinions to be shared while ensuring the safety of all readers
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	Hate speech will always appear on open forums. The problem stems from how to stop this from happening.
__label__noRel	yes true i find no one really reads those comments anyways	I think having moderators who check the comments and remove any that contain hate speech is the best way of reducing it.
__label__noRel	Hate speech should not be taken as a form of free speech	https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-and-real-harm
__label__noRel	hate speech can not be given opportunity to thrive and or be heard. it should be removed the moment it is made	The algorithm should have code that detects certain hate speech words and shadow bans them so as they do not appear on the site. with a warning that it will happen if the post is posted.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	There is no need to reduce hate speech, we just need to accept it. Banning or reducing hate speech is just censorship which is not acceptable.
__label__noRel	Agreed	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Hate speech must be banned totally from the online publications.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	It is important to allow people to express their view to abide with freedom of speech. However, having the option to view these comment with a warning would allow people to ignore potential hate speech comments but still lets them read it if they want to.
__label__noRel	Knowing the rules, unfortunately, doesn't mean that people respect them. There's a lot of hate speech on Facebook and a lot of it goes unnoticed.	But education and training and awareness are also needed, so people don't repeat what mistakes they have done in the past.
__label__noRel	I agree with you, anonymity does seem to increase the level of hate speech and trolling. I found this article interesting though, it talks about the risks of splintering the internet if AI is used to limit speech too strongly. I found it interesting https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/03/29/the-future-of-free-speech-trolls-anonymity-and-fake-news-online/	Despite our general right to freedom of speech, hate speech remains inextricably linked to hate crimes and intolerance. A hard stance should be taken by newspapers against hate speech, utilising moderators to remove hateful comments, despite the fact that it could be construed as a restriction on free speech.
__label__noRel	I definitely agree on the part of sciencing valid criticism	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Comment space encourages discussion of important topics and allows free exchange of information and so should not be eliminated. Independent moderators should be used in order to ensure that hate speech is quickly deleted and encourage users to express their ideas without using inappropriate or aggressive language.
__label__noRel	I completely agree!	i believe commenting should have it's policy, where users have to read the policy before commenting. So if a user uses language that promotes hate speech, the comment should be removed.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	The website must have words that are automatically marked as unacceptable. whenever those words are included in a comment, the website must privately warn the sender and not allow the comment to go through until the comment is rephrased correctly and politely.
__label__noRel	not true	you should autoban key hate speech words
__label__noRel	I don't think this is appropriate if it is harmful to others.	By ticking a box to agree not to be abusive or hateful before being allowed to comment
__label__noRel	Even if someone provides their personal details many people are still not deterred from commenting hate speech proof of this is that in Facebook where most people have their personal information they still comment hate speech in the comments on posts	you must run a bot system that will automatically detect and remove posts with mature language
__label__noRel	Continuing as normal.	I believe the following article could provide more information on hate speech, not only in the context of this discussion but as a whole and what can be done to combat it. https://www.stompoutbullying.org/blog/hate-speech
__label__noRel	I think the comment section is a good space for people to interact with the author instead of removing they should create or have an inbuilt AI that identifies bad words and mark the post as bad	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Having a comment section approver would be costly to the newspaper. Maybe algorithms can be used instead?	to reduce hate speech it is important to raise the stakes of what happens if you are caught. scientific evidence and criminological theory shows that if someone perceives greater risk in their actions, they are more likely to desist.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Banning comments only based on keywords will remove certain comments fore sure but won't help in reducing hate speech	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words.

__label__noRel	Free speech has a limit, and there is no reason why people should be allowed to post hate speech online.	I agree with your ideas. I think it still gives people a voice but without going too far
__label__noRel	Regardless of training, unconscious and conscious biases will be introduced regardless as the moderators are human.	people should have values and respect for others.Just like facebook written words are monitored and people already know these rules.A set of rules should be set
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	You have to log on to write a comment, having character/post limits, comments must be verified by someone who checks for hate speech before approving the comment for publication
__label__noRel	This should prevent such comments from being printed, but I think any attempt to 'educate' such persons is totally futile. They are hard-wired to hold that point of view, often drilled into them by parents/caregivers.

__label__noRel	I feel like we somehow need to be a little bit more specific on which tools could work, because many times it could also be difficult to set limits in what can be said and what not.

__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Through active moderation.
__label__noRel	Would make less people with no intention of harmful comments interact as they will be fearful of giving out personal data.	There should be a strict comment management system in place, someone has to supervise it and react (and possibly penalise) to users spreading hate speech.

Maybe asking to verify your identity before posting a comment would make people think more before spreading hate.
__label__noRel	I agree	I think having moderators who check the comments and remove any that contain hate speech is the best way of reducing it.
__label__noRel	I agree 100%. And to add people should be asked to explain their comments. Most hateful comments are just people trolling and looking to cause a stir.

The way to fairly reduce hate speech is to use a mix of technology and human intervention to manage the potential volume of moderation required to provide a healthy environment for discussion. There are a number of tools available that allow for pre- and post-moderation to curb the worst excesses of user comments.

I think in order to eliminate hate speech, the comment section itself must be completely eradicated to take a way all potential risk.

__label__noRel	free speech	I think that moderation is the most effective way of preventing hate speech. Filtering comments would not work as it is difficult to find a algorithm for the context of a comment. Free speech is so important it should not be removed.
__label__noRel	i agree with this and awareness should be brought to the surface	It has been shown that comments sections are popular and do drive traffic to websites and make people spend more time on the site (so pleasing advertisers) So from a commercial/publishing point of view it would seem that some kind of moderation is the best way to deal with the problem and not eliminate the section altogether.

__label__noRel	I do not agree we should be able to speak up	the comment section is for sharing information and opinions without the need of hate speech. those who promote and share hate speech should get banned from the comment section
__label__noRel	The problem is hate speech really means political speech. It's a way of silencing dissent of political agendas that are transforming certain countries societies in a way people don't like.	readers comments be moderated and anything that is harmful, hateful or hurtful should be removed. this allows people to exercise their right of freedom of speech but limiting the harm that someones opinion may have
__label__noRel	I absolutely agree that people need to have an outlet to share their opinion, whatever that is. And the only reason to really turn comments off is where someone is seeking information, and have their answer/are satisfied with the response; but on a news site, I feel like blocking comments is a cop out for a controversial story, or to protect the sources feelings rather than giving the public a right to have a say.

__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	Some hate speech is clear, you can moderate the high level hate speech easily with key word bans, however some topics are more nuanced	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

They would need to have a pretty high number of mods in order to keep up as each newspaper carries so many articles.

__label__noRel	It would have the advantage of searching out offensive words prior to them actually being printed and could be stopped before they are.	We need a more thick skin with some of our debate topics if we want to win arguements against "hate"
__label__noRel	people with positive comments won't be able to share	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	Freedom of speech should be always encouraged	Be more strict when allowing people to create profiles, that require identification before allowing anybody to comment. Stopping people being anonymous enough to feel confident while posting hate speech I think will be more beneficial than restricting peoples comments.
__label__noRel	Agreed, just a simple implementation of guidelines can go a long way just as stated in the following article https://help.ft.com/faq/commenting-on-articles/what-are-your-commenting-guidelines/	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy

__label__noRel	That's true. Most social media companies are already using AI to detect and remove hate speech. Here's an article about this: https://www.newsy.com/stories/artificial-intelligence-is-used-to-track-down-hate-speech/	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section.

__label__noRel	Absolutely - and it is essential that these behaviours are addressed through better education on diversity and inclusivity.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	Limiting the algorithms push to only show negative or controversial viewpoints would go a long way to decreasing the hate comments.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I like this way of thinking. Allow everyone to comment however only a few comments are shown. Comments that are not hate speech	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	If comments are present they should not be regulated. People should not allow themselves to be personally offended by the opinions of others. People have a right to their own beliefs and opinions.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	One user by the name of AndreaP said in order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section Newspapers should be one sided providers. I strongly disagree with this argument. It is very autocratic and happens a lot in countries where media and citizens does not have freedom and oppressed by harsh leadership. Comments in newspapers help many to get raw information from the ground and open minds of many to see issues differently from differing opinions. Indeed comments section are necessary
__label__noRel	That people can write hate comments	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.

So maybe it is too fastidious	the comment section is for sharing information and opinions without the need of hate speech. those who promote and share hate speech should get banned from the comment section
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	The only possible way to reduce hate speech is to have some kind of algorithm that may recognise certain words and phrases. Other than that it would mean moderating the comment section.
__label__noRel	I really like this idea, as hateful material could be hidden quickly.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	Persons will have to think before responding.	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__noRel	I think appointing moderators for this task is quite costly and it will be based on the subjective opinion of the moderator. Interference will prevent freedom of speech and will be a bit biased.	I found this really interesting, "Khan said the freedom of opinion and expression, including the right to seek, receive and disseminate diverse sources of information, must be upheld by States in times of crises and armed conflict as a precious ‘survival right’ on which people’s lives, health, safety, security and dignity depend." This is similar to what lots of people have been saying regarding worrying that this sort of censorhip could overextend. (https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/10/protect-freedom-expression-vital-survival-right-civilians-armed-conflict-un)
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	I have already said that people who have already displayed hate speech on a website should be banned from giving their opinion.
__label__noRel	I agree with your suggestion	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	Yes people are very technological savvy and capable of using fake accounts to continue spreading whatever comments without consideration and that makes it hard to trace them.	The comment section needs to be moderated using some kind of filter to automatically filter any words on the banned list and then use a report system to flag up anything which tries to bypass this. This will allow a human moderator to quickly decide what can be kept and what needs action.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	Maybe AI could filter hate speech
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is often used as a reason not to have readers comments. It seems that this is not a fair argument for eliminating readers comments because of the psychological phenomenon of "cognitive dissonance" - we automatically search for echo chambers in any context.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.

__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	I think that someone should be assigned as a moderator who assesses comments before they are posted to ensure they don't contain any offensive information
__label__noRel	This still leaves comment sections open to abuse and may embolden other readers to pile onto the hate speech comments with hateful comments of their own.	comment sections should not be removed as that will prevent those with positive comments form sharing their thoughts, they should instead be reviewed regulary so that hate speech is flagged and removed another solution is for comments to be approved by moderators before they go public
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	I definitely think newspapers should remove the comment space because it encourages trolls and hate speech
__label__noRel	removing the comment space completely would allow people to focus solely on the content of the news and not allow people to provide their comments, this might give people the chance to be completely objective and just focus on what is in front of them instead of them using the comment space as a place to vent their frustrations.	While hate speech can be harmful , it can also be helpful. If we can read through the speeches we can be able to determine what the problem is from the comments and improve.We can also create work limit on comments.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	disagree, chat feature is useful	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.

__label__noRel	everyone has the right to share their opinions, however online comments make it too easy for hate and discrimination to be spread with out consequences. There needs to be a way to stop the hate spreading but also still give people the oppertunity to express their comments so i think this is a good idea	Having moderators remove hateful speech and providing better education.
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	I think we should just collect personal information. It works in South Korea. People will behave if their are not anonymous. Modertors are important too, but not enough,
__label__noRel	It would be irresponsible for newspaper publications to not police comments as they are giving the platform for people to voice their opinions.

__label__noRel	i agree with this comment,	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	people will find a way to comment horrible things elsewhere in newspapers	I think that the warning system is a good route, as the AI might eliminate valid arguments and miss hate speech accidentally. A warning system would still need an AI, but it warns users that their comment may be hate speech and if it is, the user can rethink their wording or risk posting it. If they post it, maybe a manual review can happen to determine if it was hate speech or not.

__label__noRel	Who is to say what is or isn't 'harmful'? It sounds like you want to control a good chunk of the population who don't agree with you on things.	More emphasis on moderation of specific language would reduce the risk of hate speech. Also, moderators approving comments before they appear on the website would help.

__label__noRel	This is very true and likely	I have read through some of the cooments and my stance is still the same. It is no doubt that hate speech is a problem, however, not allowing the public the opportunity to comment on issues may not only be a problem against freedom of speech, it may also cause the newspaper to lose some of its loyal readers if they're not able to engage with the content shared by the newspaper.

Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them.

This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	I agree. The BBC has previously been reprimanded for only having one side of the climate change debate speak (denier vs scientist). The public should receive multiple points of view in a way that is balanced and evidence-based.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	this is censorship	There should be moderation reviewers to delete harmful comments
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	We should all have the option to voice our opinion. If doing so can result in hate speech, then we have to find a way to fight it instead of trying to eliminate comments altogether. Flagging certain words or using algorithms could potentially could help hide comments that don't add any value and are just trying to cause harm
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	I believe removing the comment section is not a solution and that it actually encourages hate speech
__label__noRel	I agree with this, this tools can be helpful in reducing hate speech	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	I agree and I think because there are so many people with so many different opinions, it should be censored before it is either posted or passed through the section.	Despite our general right to freedom of speech, hate speech remains inextricably linked to hate crimes and intolerance. A hard stance should be taken by newspapers against hate speech, utilising moderators to remove hateful comments, despite the fact that it could be construed as a restriction on free speech.
__label__noRel	Implementing these can have a favourable outcome.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	'Free speech' does not mean the freedom to hurt others. It isn't a licence to offend and should definitely be regulated.	the best way is for companies to filter hate speech and remove it as long as the criteria for hate speech comes from an independent organisation. If companies themselves govern what is hate speech then we would become subject to there rules which you would lose the point of freedom of speech. Also there should be more support in the community for people who are being targeted in hate speech attacks.
__label__noRel	I agree, everyone has freedom of speech but no should abuse it and use it using hate speech. Everybody should respect everyone's idea/opinion.	Freedpn of speech doesnt mean you must promote hate speech on newspapers, it basically means you free to voice out your concerns in around society in a more respectfull manner.
__label__noRel	Readers should be able to challenge the editorial views of the newspaper / individual journalist otherwise the newspaper just becomes an echo chamber.	People should be told about hate speech and how it affects other people and I think people who participate in hate speech should have some sort of panishment.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	If eliminating readers comments is out of the question, then it must be that hate speech is recognized and removed before a comment is even published. People use the free speech argument but free speech isn't 100% guaranteed in cases of speech causing harm (e.g. Yelling fire in a crowded theatre). Hate speech causes harm.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	We need very close moderation as this in all likelihood is the best way to ensure hate speech does not spread, human interaction is key as algorithms do not do a very good job
__label__noRel	If journalistss are allowd hteir view and opinion which in many instances can be objecive, public should defientley be allowed to shar theirs, since ournalists are there to promot information and possibly dialogue as well	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	It risks depressing people	I think that the introduction of moderators to remove any hate speech would be beneficial. Perhaps the introduction of guidelines as to what constitutes permitted negative comments.
__label__noRel	I absolutely agree with that position. As much as I hope and believe people should not resort to hate speech, but rather have a civilized conversation and respect each other's opinions, I am aware people might simply not be capable of that. Also - hate speech is not illegal in most countries. Quote from Wikipedia: "While "hate speech" is not a legal term in the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that most of what would qualify as hate speech in other western countries is legally protected free speech under the First Amendment." Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_in_the_United_States	Having moderators or AI to automatically remove content that includes keywords with cursing or inflammatory language, having a report/flag button so people can report and remove very offensive things
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Large companies need to invest more money in having paiI td moderators to monitor hate speech on their articles. I think all speech excpet for speech inciting people to commit violence or murder should be allowed even if i so not agree with it. I think that to prevent hate sppech it will start with educating young people
__label__noRel	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button	There is a fine line between freedom of speech and hate. And hate can be interpreted differently for different people causing biased censorship. Therefore newspapers should have moderators from both sides of opinion that overlook comments to approve before they are published
__label__noRel	Only allowing paying users might result in the most of the users in a comment section having the same view. For example, many young people do not use newspaper websites. Each comment section might not be diverse at all in type of users or the opinions being shared. Is an echo chamber better, equal to, or worse than a few hate comments?	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Some people will always use hate speech and hide behind their computer, There needs to be some sort of filter added to flag such comments and people and a ban put on the user
__label__noRel	Allowing people to express their opinions ensures that there is free speech	Filter comments or have a ban on words that come across as hateful.
__label__noRel	Sometimes, the vocal minority are the ones which are giving the hate speech, having a system allows a voice for those who don't want to speak	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	Posting anonymously is not good. We should all be accountable to the website providers who have a duty to monitor their sites and act upon racist homophobe etc	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	Agreed, just a simple implementation of guidelines can go a long way just as stated in the following article https://help.ft.com/faq/commenting-on-articles/what-are-your-commenting-guidelines/	Make readers agree to not sharing hate speech and let them know that if they do, they will be blocked from commenting.
__label__noRel	not well explained	by never posting the hate speech words in the newspaper
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	I think in order to eliminate hate speech, the comment section itself must be completely eradicated to take a way all potential risk. Newspapers have the sole purpose of giving accurate depictions of current events, there is no responsibility for them to offer social commentary space. One only has to look at the hatred filled comments of the Daily Mail web pages to see the concerning language being used on a regular basis.
__label__noRel	Your post contains the argument, "Newspapers should cancel comment space because it can create... fake news." I don't think this is particularly convincing. By that logic, newspapers and news websites themselves should be cancelled since they will periodically create "fake news" - sometimes not due to malice but rather by an honest mistake [or journalist incompetence/ignorance]. Ben Goldacre, for example, runs (ran?) a blog called, "Bad Science" and a recurring motif was journalists failing to accurately depict scientific insights. We could argue that their exagerrations and mistranslations could be construed as "fake news" but there's no malice involved. The journalists weren't trying to deceive anyone. The solution to getting closer to an approximation of truth is not to remove an entire avenue of communication, but rather to open up (regulated) communication in the hopes that the arguments that are most cogent rises above the rest - and that the logical wheat be separated from the illogical chaff. That is to say, I think we need a better system than just, "let's get rid of the comment section." It's a tricky problem, no doubt, and a perfect solution may not exist. But we should not let "perfect" get in the way of, "good enough." In a subsequent post, I detail ONE possible method that incorporates several solutions previously mentioned (and as I write this post, I thought of ways to improve it further. Not perfect, but perhaps good enough).	the website should have terms and conditions on the words that can be used and warnings if failure to follow the recommended words .
__label__noRel	I agree that with good moderation it is possible to create an environment where people can openly discuss topics.	I think one way to reduce hate speech online would be monitoring the message. If someone writes a message, it should be checked before allowing it to be posted, it could be done by a simple program where the computer looks for offensive words.
__label__noRel	Sometimes, in the context of a debate, aggressive language is necessarily to demonstrate the emotion of the people and their dissatisfaction	First, it would be important to define what hate speech is so that readers that want to post comments have a chance to self-modify their posts. Secondly, having a filter that will automatically block posts that contain proscribed words could also help to reduce the amount of hate speech featured in comments sections.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	The key way to do it would be with very in-depth moderation which is non-biased and respects criticisms but its aware when a comment is taken too far and viewed as hate speech. the comment section should not be eliminated but mainly moderated and supervised
__label__noRel	I completely agree!	Is space for readers comment really that necessary? Nowadays, with all other social medias available, the conversation can happen on platform made for dialogue. But as practice shows, those "conversations" are often very polarized and everyone is kind of screaming in a void.
__label__noRel	would move the issue somewhere else	Proper moderation by the website owner should be required, whether using human moderators or using technology to flag potential hate speech for human review and action.
__label__noRel	https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/05/reader-comments-on-news-sites-we-want-to-hear-what-your-publication-does/ This article highlights what effect hate speech has on readers in the comments sections	They could force users to login and even if they chose to post annonymously, it can be flagged for hate speech and they can be banned from using the platform again.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	I think removing the comment space is just avoiding the problem. There can be interesting and thoughtful comments and we would miss from them. Newspapers websites should instead try to regulate the comment space by introducing a bot or hiring appropriate moderators or there should be some punishment to discourage the use of hate speech.
__label__noRel	giving those you always provide hate speech anonymously gives them the upper hand with gettong away with it. It makes it easier for them to do it over and over again	If eliminating readers comments is out of the question, then it must be that hate speech is recognized and removed before a comment is even published.

I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words.

__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes.

__label__noRel	I am deeply uncomfortable with the idea of 'tracking people down' for 're-education' for the sin of offering their opinions online (even if said opinions are quite obnoxious).	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	One mainstream way of mitigating hate speech on online comment sections is to pre-moderate comments. This however may lead to a 'biased' viewpoint. A lighter example of this could be how some youtubers delete constructive criticism.

__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry.

Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	I think there should be moderators on articles that make the comments. less visible so offensive comments can have a warning before viewing
__label__noRel	By removing the comment section will entice further hate speech on another platform. Rather allow people to give their opinion and block comments that relate to hate speech.	I think that hate speech should be reduced through widescale education about the origins, hurts and trauma behind words which are used. By educating people learn how to respect or debate in effective ways without insulting or offending. UNESCO are suggesting that addressing hate speech through education can bring respect for each other.
__label__noRel	Agree	We can start by encouraging people to debate and say their opinions to incite meaningful and helpful conversations and comments instead of hate and other harmful communication types
__label__noRel	Exactly, it's a slippery slope when a system is doing all the work https://www.cairn.info/revue-questions-de-communication-2020-2-page-529.htm	I think comments give the ability to the users to express their opinion on what is described in the articles and this is an important rule for democracy. Removing the ability to comment in my view is basically limiting free speech. I also believe that user do not need necessarily to be identifiable, being anonymous is fine as long as they respect others and their opinions.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Removing the comment section all together is a fair point as news is meant to be fair and impartial. People share their opinions based on their biases and that's not what the news is for - that's what social media is for. But in this case allowing the comment section to remain would be great if people would not abuse the power to share freely by sharing hate speech and slander. us as humans need to be regulated by a set of rules in order to keep a functioning society and i think a filtered comment section is the solution.

__label__noRel	Removal of hate speech is not too much power, but hate speech needs to be clearly defined and a set of rules adhered to.	Newspaper websites should use human or artificial intelligence-based moderators who can impartially identify hate speech and remove it from their platforms without removing or censoring genuine, constructive comments and perspectives.

__label__noRel	Yes. This will prevent the probability of danger that hate speech usually causes.	This article below focuses on the negative views of the comment section. I like the quote from Dr Philips, as she explains that more discussion is required, not less, and thus an onsite intervention is required to deal with hate speech as opposed to the removal of the comment section. https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation

It plays a role in keeping the discussion going. It would be smart to rather monitor comments to ensure hate speech or utterances of a vile nature are greatly reduced through the use of some sort of algorithm that picks up on problematic words and deletes comments or it being done manually by people who will moderate the comment section.
__label__noRel	more teachers needed	Hate speech is something people intentionally and so if people continue to participate in it, they should be punished.

__label__noRel	I think that removing peoples ability to comment would be more harm than good because they will just do it elsewhere like social media platforms.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	I totally agree with this statement.	While censoring certain words in the context of a comment would help reduce hate speech, an issue that would need to be considered is the use of images used as hate speech. Some "memes" can contain hate speech to the AI may misinterpret this as a regular image while the image could be posted as hate speech. An example of this is when people on Reddit use images as "memes" containing racism and sometimes the bot does not flag it as racism. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230
__label__noRel	I agree while hate speech can be and should be monitored and removed immediately in order to reduce trauma on affected group and not to embolden other bigots. Platforms should still allow users to express opinions contrary to the creators. Peer review of reporting works well in these instances when someone goes too far - but this is also abused by with review bombing	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	A possible way to address hate speech on newspaper sites would be to incorporate both human moderators and some sort of AI that monitors for hateful words and comments. The requirement to submit personally identifying information before commenting might also help because without this then anyone can create a fake name that hides the person's true identity so therefore more likely to engage in hate speech. If personal information is required, then hate speech would be less likely.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	It is a tricky one to get the balance correct. There will always be some people in society who are happy to spout nonsense/hatred online as they sit behind a keyboard. At the same time, there will also be people who wish to share their more sensible and respectful views on topics.
__label__noRel	i agree, its nice to see different opinions on different subject, different perspectives from community.	I think that education with penalties such as exclusion from the community for repeated offences is the best policy. Like many I agree that some people are unaware they unaware they have caused offence to others.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	There needs to be a level of moderation before comments are posted. Comments that are harmful, false or misleading shouldn't be allowed to be put up, but there should still be room for healthy debate.
__label__noRel	The public are not experts and their views should not be publicised as such.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	Great	Ideally comment section should not be available on newspaper to reduce hate speech
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	the fairly way of reducing hate speech from newspapers website is not allowing anyone to comment that is to bloc the comment section.
__label__noRel	A team of moderators would have their own bias so it is not possible to know what is really hate speech.	Filter comments or have a ban on words that come across as hateful.
__label__noRel	I actually really like this idea - it deals well with the issue of removing hate speech as nothing just gets automatically published and checked later. Yes it will cut down on the amount of comments overall but even that isn't a bad thing, if only the most coherent, high-quality comments are published.	I agree that the only way to ensure balanced discussion without allowing hate or eliminating genuine responses is through moderation of comments before posting
__label__noRel	I agree	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Make readers agree to not sharing hate speech and let them know that if they do, they will be blocked from commenting.
__label__noRel	Unmoderated online comment forums are magnets for noxious speech. For years they have carried people’s discontent out into the world, while the writers sit safely behind screens. It’s almost bittersweet to think back on the time we once blamed internet flaming on the online disinhibition of middle school pranksters. It is the many unhappy adults in the electorate who are posting the things they are really thinking in comment boxes. Nearly three-quarters of internet users – 73 percent – have witnessed online harassment. News website comment sections host antagonistic conversations between contributors. Nine out of 10 respondents of a Pew Research study said the online environment was more enabling of criticism. The squabbling can be overwhelming: As many as 34 percent of news commenters and 41 percent of news comment readers identified argumentative comments as the reason they avoid reading or joining the discourse. Multiple studies show online communities develop sophisticated norms that guide participants. Anger begets more anger. Unshackled digital vitriol is now volleyed back and forth online from all sides. Some commenters don’t even care if they are anonymous anymore. Researchers have found real-name comments on social media are actually nastier than unsigned commentary. Historically, American democracy always had some rudeness baked into it. For example, during the presidential election of 1800, incumbent President John Adams’ campaign proclaimed “murder, robbery, rape, adultery and incest will all be openly taught and practiced” if his opponent, Thomas Jefferson, won the presidency. Jefferson, meanwhile, described Adams as “a hideous hermaphroditical character,” with “neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman.” Civility in public discourse is often what people in power expect of their citizens. Demands for civility can be used by those with authority to deny power to those with none. People who feel marginalized or alienated use incivility and civil disobedience to fight the power. By causing offense and indignation, as we saw during Campaign 2016, outsiders gained massive attention for their cause. Yet “democracy only functions when its participants abide by certain conventions, certain codes of conduct and a respect for the process,” wrote cultural journalist Neal Gabler in an eloquent essay about how a hateful electorate threatens democracy. Gabler noted that the 2016 presidential campaign was referred to as the “hate election” because everyone professed to hate both candidates. It turned out to be the hate election, Gabler mused, “because of the hatefulness of the electorate.” He went on:https://theconversation.com/how-news-sites-online-comments-helped-build-our-hateful-electorate-70170	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	I agree	I dont think it is a fair choice. For how long should people be silenced. Hate speech is always going to be around. Shutting people up is not going to stop hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree the comment section is for everyone- but what else can we do. Evidence has shown that hate speech can lead to real life crimes, and that needs to be tackled.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	I agree	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	Name and shame those that want to spout hate, I agree.	I dont think it is a fair choice. For how long should people be silenced. Hate speech is always going to be around. Shutting people up is not going to stop hate speech.
__label__noRel	Additional administrative workload and time factor for posting comments	Well..hate speech is a problem then there is freedom of speech as well. There is a possibility a writer is giving valid points.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	Have something that sensors specific hate words and filter them out
__label__noRel	This is an interesting point of view and I certainly believe that reducing the level of anonymity may help to moderate opinions.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	moderating the comments would surely help
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	report anyone as soon as it is seen so they can be dealt with and removed.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	By moderating the comment section. Instead of having an individual who may be biased in their moderation, the use of an artificial intelligence software can be introduced to moderate the comment section.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	No-one should have to spend their time filtering out the disgusting things human beings are capable of saying about each other. Nobody has a right to comment on anything.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	The only way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites is letting the readers know that if they comment with negative words on the comment section they will be blocked
__label__noRel	When moderators have to approve all comments before they get posted you might create an environment where comments the moderator does not agree with do not get posted at all. The better option in my opinion would the second one where you allow readers to flag inappropriate comments, together with a moderator team reviewing these comments. In that case there is a public consensus and more transparency.	Should be reviewed first before it gets published
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	comments should be moderated but we cannot remove all the negative and leave the positive comments. it would look like the newspaper is being biased
__label__noRel	It may prevent multiples accounts from one user	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__noRel	The problem is that people can register an account giving false details, so how do we ensure they have given their correct age for example?	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	Punishments would be good but also a mixture of education and this could help. Hate speech is a very person-by-person thing, what some may think isn't, some may think is.	If the aim is merely to reduce hate speech then I think eradicating the comment section goes too far. Why should people not be allowed to comment and have their say. The newspaper is punishing the public for the crimes of a few. It seems rather unfair. I think the best method is to have monitors.
__label__noRel	Becauce we are different as peole we find some views offensive	I think this is a task that is hard to do because it has to be done in a way that would not hinder freedom of speech but at the same time not attack people. Thus, I think comments should be flagged depending on the words used but not be deleted until it has been checked.
__label__noRel	Because some peoples opinions can be hurtful to others	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	Hate speech an be considered a form of verbal assault. Why should we accept that?	Censoring speech prevents progress as a soceity. (https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2016/04/free-speech-important/)
__label__noRel	newspapers cover opinions that fit with their narrative so you cannot say that they don't portray a one sided profile	I think the best way to reduce hate speech in newspaper websites is to ensure that the site can detect words and phrases that can be considered hate speech, and block them from being posted on the comment section. Also, a moderator to approve each comment section before it becomes publicly accessible is a notion which can be adopted as well.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Algorithms are a must to cut out hate speech. Allowing only paying subscribers is elitist but necessary as being traceable is important.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Hate speech should not be allowed to dominate the narrative as it defeats the process and hinders effective communication. As a result, flagging and blocking of problematic accounts can prove to be effective in combating the spread of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I think this is very important. Hate speech will drive away advertisers as they will not want to be associated with hateful comments. Newspapers will have to stop those comments to retain revenue. Facebook has started to process and it is about time other media outlets follow. https://www.facebook.com/community/whats-new/new-tools-features-nurture-community/	A machine filtering comments would have a positive affect as then people still have the freedom of speech without the vulger and disrespectful language
__label__noRel	Using moderators and flagging can be abused to prevent valid comments. If the moderator doesn't like what you have written, or if there are several users who doesn't like you on the platform, they can abuse the flagging. Just look at YouTube and how many abuse the flagging to get rid of a channel or person who they don't agree with and who have strong opinions you don't agree with.	Ensuring there are rules to adhere to, perhaps muting certain offensive words or phrases. Making sure commnect sections are heavily monitored.
__label__noRel	this can work if they have a filtering system to filter out the the hate speech comments	Certain hateful words/phrases could be blocked or they could introduce a reporting option in the comments section.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Through active moderation.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-63291527
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	I disagree with the stance of doing away with the comment section in its entirety, it goes against the premise of media which is to spark a debate or discussion.
__label__noRel	I also agree this is a good solution	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	Even with human moderators it still comes down to personal preference. There is no person alive who doesn't have ANY biases. what one human moderator might deem acceptable language another might not. Therefore, even human moderation isn't 100% accurate and failsafe.	This article describes how censoring might lead users to leave platforms and join other platforms with lighter censoring rules https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/global-extremes/does-censoring-radical-right-social-media-work/
__label__noRel	This isnt a freedom of speech issue. That is only in relation to the govt not curtailing free speech. A private company... newspaper, has no obligation to allow you to freely air your views.	every comment submitted by readers must be checked internally for hate speech
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

Thus, I think comments should be flagged depending on the words used but not be deleted until it has been checked.
__label__noRel	Do not stop free speech, filter out hate speech!	As I saw some commentary on this platform, my opinion is that we need 2 things. A submission of personal data before one can have access to post anything related and real time moderation of the comments. Big platforms like YouTube, Instagram and others are held accountable for their users' actions and they have had a lot of success so far. Source: https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/combat-online-hate-speech/
__label__noRel	Education about hate speech has been around and people still practice hate speech	Hate speech poses grave dangers for the cohesion of a democratic society. It can lead to acts of violence and conflict on a wider scale.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	I think in order to eliminate hate speech, the comment section itself must be completely eradicated to take a way all potential risk. Newspapers have the sole purpose of giving accurate depictions of current events, there is no responsibility for them to offer social commentary space. One only has to look at the hatred filled comments of the Daily Mail web pages to see the concerning language being used on a regular basis.
__label__noRel	Who gets to determine what exactly IS hate speech? It's a slippery slope that eventual will deem everything hate speech.	someone to check their posts before the article goes live, like a robot think
__label__noRel	I agree	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	I agree!	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Hire moderators and similar positions, and also having filtering systems
__label__noRel	By making rules it means they might lose a some of their viewers because most people are disrespectful and hate discipline	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	This will allow online users to think twice before spewing hate speech	Newspaper websites can eliminate space for readers comments for articles that they think are more likely to receive more hate speech
__label__noRel	Comment sections seem rather pointless anyway and are just usually vessels for people to argue. There's social media nowadays to weigh in on your opinion	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	It may be a good idea to involve some form of moderators to check if there are any hate speeches. Aggressive comments may be censored accordingly. However, we need to be careful in doing this as some may have negative effect as silencing voices.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	Someone should monitor the comments in the website such as administrator or moderator. Or comments need to review first by administrator before it can be posted on the website
__label__noRel	I firmly agree. Comment sections need to be regulated not banned. Rules need to be put in place on what will be considered as hate speech with that,the consequences of part taking in the said hate speech.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	the newspapers should have an algorithm that can detect comments which go against the community guidelines and ban these accounts. Spam accounts should also be detected and banned if they do no contribute constructively to the newspapers.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	I think we can do this by having comments sufficiently moderated and removed if needed if they are producing hate speech.
__label__noRel	This would work well with non-bias moderators	hate speech online will always be there and we shouldn't focus on hate speech a lo because there will be a lot of positive comments
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	Agree with this, removing the space for commenting without educating people would just move the hate speech elsewhere.	Hate speech invites violence and undermines people
__label__noRel	making individuals aware	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	Could exclude nasty comments	newspaper might remove comment section as a way to prevent hate speech. however, it does remove freedom of speech to those who would like to express themselves through comment section.
__label__noRel	No room for intelligent discussion	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	i think this is a good idea but moderators would be time consuming and it depends on what is not harmful to one person maybe harmful to somebody else	I don't think removing the comment section reduces hate speech per se, it just pushes it elsewhere. I can't help feeling this sort of censorship is an infringement on free speech.
__label__noRel	How will we know how the public feels about about a certain topic if they cant even give their opinions? I do not think this is fair. At least appropriate measures can be taken in order to stop hate speech.	Agreeing with others here: a standard of moderation would have to be communicated to the user, with straightforward policies of flagging or reporting potentially hateful comments. A synthesis of live and algorithmic moderators might be best, as certain words can be auto-flagged for review, whereas other things might involve a more delicate touch.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	That would take away free speech, however I think they need to add some sort of AI that can immediately pick up any forms of hate speech and immediately delete or even block it
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	There should be some level of censoring to eliminate hate speech, but not to the extent where comments are totally disabled
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	WEBSITES BREACH FREEDOM OF SPEECH by eliminating space for readers comments
__label__noRel	This will improve the language but not the other content	The lines between hate speech and freedom of speecg and expression and constantly getting blurred further and further.
__label__noRel	yes definately, removal of the section is an infringement rather find a way to navigate around sensitive or hate speech comments. maybe burn subscription of that particular individual	monitor comments before the are posted
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	My position as a reader and my argument is that bases on the rules of speech people have freedom of speech and expression. That should be done in a proper way without insulting others or hating or being racist in your speech. Websites and newspapers should not remove the comments of the people responding to hate speech. This is done according to the rules found in the following article: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	Hate speech must be eliminated. The only way to do this thoroughly is with human moderation.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	flag all the comments that contain vulgar words and warn the sender. the comment must be rephrased, failure to do so must result in the suspension of the sender from commenting

__label__noRel	Requires a lot of moderation	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	the issue with an algorithm is that is isnt able to sympathise with news. yes it is good to filter out bad words but i think hate speech can be relative to the user digesting that information	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
