__label__Support	Technology is ever changing. Maybe what we currently have cannot make lasting change, but it can make a change in the right direction. As technology updates, we can do more. I think it's more of an issue of becoming willing.	Climate change is accelerating - due to feedback loops- much faster that what humanity can -or is willing to- decelerate it.

__label__Support	True, we need to increase technology to deal with this problem.	Climate change is accelerating - due to feedback loops- much faster that what humanity can -or is willing to- decelerate it. Unfortunately is not feasible with current technology
__label__Attack	I'm not sure the answers to those questions but if more of us put pressure on policy makers to invest funds into scientific studies it would give us a greater idea, but no one seems to care or want to spend any money to improve understanding of the issue.

__label__Support	Adaptation and fighting climate change often go hand in hand	Human resources and efforts are best used adapting to the effects of climate change, rather than attempting to mitigate climate change itself.
__label__Support	I agree I think we should adapt the best we can. We can't change what has already happened.	Human resources and efforts are best used adapting to the effects of climate change, rather than attempting to mitigate climate change itself.
__label__Attack	Since most of the climate change is caused by big organisations, I dont think just adapting to climate change is the right thing to say. There is a lot that is out of our hands.	Human resources and efforts are best used adapting to the effects of climate change, rather than attempting to mitigate climate change itself.
__label__Support	I agree that we, as humans, can adapt to the situation as best as possible. But we can also take small steps towards change. The situation doesn't have to be impossible.	Human resources and efforts are best used adapting to the effects of climate change, rather than attempting to mitigate climate change itself.
__label__Support	Adaptation is not giving up and I agree that effort made to do this is a good idea. The more people think about this, the more likely they are to achieve changes without even realizing they are doing it. Adaptation doesn't mean we are giving up on the environment. It means we are not stressing so hard over the guilt of what we perceive we have done to damage the earth.	Human resources and efforts are best used adapting to the effects of climate change, rather than attempting to mitigate climate change itself.
__label__Attack	I dont mind this but we cant ignore the fact that there are company who are spreading so much pollution and greenhouse effect just for profit. We need to reprimand them as well.	We can only achieve by tremendous advances and investment in technology: clean energy production, CO2 capture in massive scale, hydrogen planes, ... , and much much more

__label__Attack	absolutely true growing more trees are the only solution to this problem	Technology can not correct this problem unless u can grow more trees as quick as possible using technology.
__label__Support	I agree with this. With that being said, we as consumers need to demand more from the same organizations. We need to go to all levels of government and demand that these same organizations give us alternatives in the form of electric and hydro cars while also proving that we are ready to purchase them to give these same organizations incentive to play along.	I think we have to look into alternatives fuels and see how we can cut down on the consumption. The main onus is on big organisations since they are major defaulters.
__label__Attack	we need to adopt to the current situation , we should not deny that we are responsible for all the problem that we create in accordance with situation	We cannot adopt but we should adopt to it because there is no other go with the affected environment unless helping the environment less pollution
__label__Attack	While I agree, there are a lot of things that have to happen first before this can become a reality. We have to rework gas stations around the country so that they have the charging stations necessary for electric vehicles and we have to build the charging stations near highways and thoroughfares for those same electric cars so that the future infrastructure is ready to handle the influx of electric cars before demanding they be manufactured at such a high rate.	electric vehicles should be consider as mandatory by the major fuel consumption nations

__label__Attack	Technology may increase to where it can be - like developing time travel.	Some damage towards the climate is currently irreversible to prevent reversal in time.
__label__Attack	The fact is that the knowledge on climate change is still very limited. Assumptions that we make about the damage today could be disproved tomorrow. Take for example the holes in the Ozone. We discovered them with advances in technology, but no one is really sure that we caused them or even for how long they had actually been there. With advancements in technology there is little reason to believe we can't reverse some of these things.	Some damage towards the climate is currently irreversible to prevent reversal in time.

__label__Support	This an argument that I agree with. I do not believe there is a consensus and I have little confidence in the "science" that supports man's heavy influence on climate change. I believe a lot is hysteria used to socially engineer behavior. I also believe a lot of hubris and ego has contributed to this doomsday theory. The leftist talking point last year was we have only 12 years left before we are all dead due to climate change. That is utter nonsense.	Climate change is anyways is a hoax! 31,000 scientists reject global warming and say "no convincing evidence" that humans can or will cause global warming
__label__Attack	Countries still catching up to the industrial revolution will argue it unfair.	I agree it is going to need a world effort to combat climate change. Not just a few rich countries trying to.
__label__Support	Whether or not it is a hoax, human having rational thinking he have the guilty when he affect the environment with pollution like fumes, industrial wastes and other things damaging the society.	No. sorry i not accept Climate change is not a hoax. we also feel in real life. we need more awarness
__label__Attack	I tend to think that the government subsidizes too much already	And the Govt must give rewards to those who do activities to protect the environment.

__label__Attack	I think there is another group that is probably more a majority than the two groups mentioned. That group is the people who do care about the environment but is overwhelmed by the sheer cost and magnitude of the many things they are told they should be doing while also trying to navigate their own lives. And when they don't scream vocally about saving everything, they get accused of being part of the exploiting group.	There are two groups of people. one who want to save the ecology and another group who want to exploit the environment for making money. unless strict rules are passed to stop the abuse of nature we cant save the nature and the environment
__label__Support	This makes so much sense, and its not like it cannot be done. Many countries during the lockdown for Covid, showed they could easily have one day a month or such to have no pollution days where it would help the environment immensely	There must be one day lock down for every month to maintain the pollution which we are experiencing through lock down for corona
__label__Attack	Lockdowns are not the answer to the problem.

__label__Support	Absolutely right, we are in the hands of corporate business man. But we can change this situation by changing our lifestlyes.	I think climate change is a problem, but has been brought about not by the average citizens of the world but by the governments and big corporations who control us. We are deceived and being lied to by global organizations such as the World Economic Forum who want to take over and control the planet
__label__Attack	The world is changing in terms of human empowerment and the connectedness of the individual and the transparency of the powers that be. The opinions of the people CAN be heard and change is possible. Humanity needs to work together and gain strength from one another.	This conversation seems to be pointless as our opinions will probably never be heard by those who are in control and authority and by big government who controls the people. They are the ones that need to hear and listen to the people through forums and discussions
__label__Attack	If we don't ask corporations to step in and get involved, then we're ignoring the biggest contributor of this issue - EVERYBODY needs to be involved.	Placing blame and/or trying to figure out who's at fault is pointless. It doesn't matter if it's the corporations, individuals, or natural processes--the problem exists, whatever the cause. And it has to be addressed, even if it's expensive, even if it's monumental, even if it seems impossible to solve--because without working toward a solution, our planet and ourselves will cease to exist.
__label__Support	More emphasis on the smaller, daily things we can do to reduce waste would probably allow us to see change more quickly than being shamed about every product we use that might potentially be bad for the environment. Manufacturers can be a big part of that. If there are no cheap, dangerous plastic shopping bags made, then they won't be part of our homes that we need to deal with. It's definitely a group effort.	Everyone want to know about the climate change increase due to Manmade cause.So first we want start to reduce the waste level in our home.It leads to changes in the society if else we will face the huge climate changes in coming decades.
__label__Attack	All we can do is reduce our impact but not reverse it.Unfortunately is statistically inevitable	Sustainable efforts reduce and reverse the global warming trend.
__label__Attack	What point is there in preserving our climate for humanity, if, by taking these sorts of actions, we lose our collective humanity? Better for the human race to go extinct than to degrade to barbaric form of behavior advocated for in this argument.	Billionaires who make money by killing planet earth, should be shot to death. They are not understanding what they are doing. Their aim is only money.
__label__Attack	In a neoliberal capitalist society, is hard to find incentives for "everyone working together" and "making sacrifices"	I feel that manmade climate change can be reversed by everyone working together and making sacrifices to improve the environment. It will be made possible by people figuring out ways to save on carbon emissions instead of taking the easiest route. If we can do that in more ways than one, we should be able to save the planet.
__label__Support	You're totaly right. the problem is the power of consumption over our minds. I see the appeal it has on children.

__label__Support	Agree, bio-fuels is not a clean form of energy. Rich countries support it as a cheap form of energy, yet it has a high CO2 profile	Rich nations rigged poor (powerless) nations. By choosing bio-fuel or dams solutions they just sentencing poor nations to extinction

__label__Support	NOT. To "sort" climate change we need to do a LOT, and one of those absolutely mandatory requirement is to use clean energy - no matter the cost	Rich nations rigged poor (powerless) nations. By choosing bio-fuel or dams solutions they just sentencing poor nations to extinction
__label__Support	True, I have read on one of the report on the COP205 that issues left unresolved included discussions on Article 6, common time frames, long-term finance, transparency issues for the Paris Agreement, report of the Adaptation Committee, and the report of the Consultative Group of Experts.	I have heard that the Chile/Madrid Climate Change Conference Closes with Limited Ambition
__label__Attack	All the environment benefits can be achieved just by a vegetarian diet, you don't have to go fully vegan	This would have severe positive environmental advantages

__label__Support	Agree, think of CO2 emissions saved because of less caddle	This would have severe positive environmental advantages
__label__Support	also, less caddle means less incentives for deforestation	This would have severe positive environmental advantages

__label__Attack	There are far more sustainablity actions that should be taken before dietary constrictions, like reducing the loop of consumption in the US which is based on inflation and debt generation.	Vegan way of eating and living is the only sustainable (for our planet) lifestyle
__label__Support	There is a growing body of evidence that everybody - not just the vulnerable - wearing masks significantly reduces the viral load in a confined space.	We need a minimal set of protection measures (masks, ventilation...) in public spaces and public transportation.
__label__Attack	But "personal liberty" can't be absolute: one person's liberty should not force another person into hiding. Also, the whole "state control" meme seems to be disingenous: in times of great crisis the state not only may but MUST intervene for the safety and security of all. That is the core reason for the state to exist.	I believe that mandatory mask-wearing policies infringe upon personal liberty, and that mask mandates are politicized and are manipulative tactics by certain politicians and special interest groups as ways to increase state control
__label__Attack	I agree	No , I think that would seriously limit freedom of speech
__label__Support	yes, maybe like how filtering particular words are put into social media platforms like facebook, which allows particular words to be banned from posting.	No,I think the comment space should be there, but there can be another choice for people to mute the space who don't want to see them.
__label__Attack	On the other hand it also eliminates the chance of reflections or beneficial interactions within the audience	Yes it can avoid a lot of arguments and harrasments
__label__Support	I totally agree with this point because I think freedom of speech is fundamental in a modern and democratic society but at the same time we cannot avoid the fact that online hate speech have become a problem and we should deal with it	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.

__label__Support	I don't necessarily disagree, but solutions would include funding the planning system better and requiring LPAs to have conservation advice, both of which would aid early engagement and head off the development of proposals that are likely to be refused.

Inconsistent application of planning policy and conservation guidance means that improvement proposals meet with widely different and unpredictable responses in addition to delays caused by the strained planning system.
__label__Attack	This might be true, but the key is developing the pathway, which means advice.

Buildings that are not on a net zero pathway are in danger of being down valued by finance providers facing their own targets for financed emission reductions.

Cost of upgrades, which are always higher for properties in a heritage setting, are unaffordable for individual owners in low wage, low property value areas.
__label__Attack	I don't agree that upgrades are always more expensive in heritage settings; heating controls don't cost more, and secondary glazing is cheaper than window replacement, as well as saving more carbon emisisons on a whole life basis. Appropriate materials are currently less available, but fitting inappropriate materials is already against current building codes of practice; urgent training for the building industry in appropriate materials would result in increased demand and scaled-up production, driving costs down.

__label__Attack	However, it might also discourage people from leaving comments generally as it is quite difficult to leave a response and not many people would go through that much effort to say something, which there is a risk of being personally identified as well.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

__label__Attack	You'd have to get everyone to agree on a definition for cyber bullying before creating the software. Computers only know what you tell them, they aren't sentient beings capable of moral distinction. The human programming the software defines the meaning of hate speech, this really ties into the book "Noise" which discusses variables and the way it can drastically change outcomes based on the individual handling things. What is their life experience, have they experienced bullying, have they gotten therapy etc. If it's more than one person you have to collectively agree on shared experiences that culminate to the final definition of bullying.	By introducing a cyber bullying detecting software
__label__Support	This is interesting! I read an article about moderators with different policies on what constitutes hate speech and should be removed. There is an argument that some are too strict and moderate incivility, rather than just hate speech. Perhaps an AI version would have clearer guidelines programmed in? https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793	By introducing a cyber bullying detecting software
__label__Attack	At the same time, this seems like it would have such potential for corruption - who programmes the software? Newspaper sites could simple auto-remove any comments that disagree with them.	By introducing a cyber bullying detecting software
__label__Support	https://time.com/5739688/facebook-hate-speech-languages/ This is especially true because not all people speak the language! An algorithm would be best, but there are still some technical issues that we need to address.	Moderating comments sections is a lot of work to do manually, the individuals tasked with it would burn out in short time trying to manage that effectively while also having to read hateful garbage all day. If there was a system to remove hate speech it needs to be automated with an algorithm that catches certain words, then reviewed manually when someone disagrees with the content removed and it not being against guidelines. We use guidelines for everything including media regulations for accurate reporting or having to retract when information is not accurate. It's no different in the comments section, it doesn't remove free speech it regulates it to create a healthy environment to have a conversation in. Over moderation can have as severe of an effect as under, it has to be a system that takes in common complaints from both sides. Not the hate speech side per say but the sides of people who are pro free flowing conversation and those who want more shielding to avoid extremist echo chambers.
__label__Support	Absolutely, we should support hate speech or encourage it by allowing multiple infractions to be pass by unpunished.	Identifying users with hate speech and restricting their accounts from using the platform and commenting on it.
__label__Attack	Regulations fail, and extremists will point to any minor failing as strong proof of their firmly held beliefs.	i am against the removal of the comment section and i believe that regulations and clear rules are the way to go, have systems put into place and enforce the rules. let there be punishable offences for rule breakers.
__label__Support	Absolutely, vague definitions are the downfall of effective communication. A lot like "Karen" replacing the actual words for situations like racist, entitled, rude, emotionally volatile, unreasonable etc. When we all hold a different definition for a word because it's been used too broadly it becomes harder to communicate. Clearly defining what hate speech is with links to the definitions in every format is what could help. People consume information more effectively in different modes like audio, visual, written etc.	by blocking users who violate 'hate speech rules', i feel it should be clearly stated what hate speech is.
__label__Attack	If we need other peoples opinions before we can form our own then we are literally just looking for confirmation bias of what we already believe	I think that readers who use hate speech should be reported and temporarily banned from the site, as I believe that we need comments section in online newspaper articles. It is important to share your views as we have freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	We already struggle to prosecute rapists what makes you think cyber bullying takes priority?	People who take part in hate speech should be dealt with lawfully so as its a form of cyber-bullying, that way less people will resort to hate speech
__label__Attack	Education is a great tool but essentially your website gives the solution without the steps. First people need to learn how to disarm the person they're debating with to educate them, which most people don't have the finesse to do. How do you change someones views when they're defensive from start to finish of your conversation?	I believe the following article could provide more information on hate speech, not only in the context of this discussion but as a whole and what can be done to combat it. https://www.stompoutbullying.org/blog/hate-speech
__label__Attack	I think it is interesting to read the comments on a newspaper article, as the article is written from one perspective, while the comments show a much wider view. Even if I disagree with them, it is interesting and thought provoking to read the alternative view. Disabling comments reduces free speech and makes everything monitored and authorised - then you have to question who is controlling what we see?	Some of the comment section of some newspaper articles are not worth reading and may sometimes spoil the reading experience. https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/
__label__Attack	I feel that in this case, by getting rid of hate speech, I feel that it is worth sacrificing a part of free speech in order to make everyone feel comfortable.	Disabling comments reduces free speech and makes everything monitored and authorised - then you have to question who is controlling what we see?
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	I actually agree that eliminating the space for conversation on polarizing topics can reduce extremist echo chambers sometimes. Though they often move to other platforms that have zero regulations to hold that conversation when they can't have it where they saw something. Which increases the odds of being stuck in a hateful echo chamber.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	Doing nothing because of a fear that doing something will be ineffective, means simply that nothing will definitely be achieved. Freedom of speech is definitely curtailed if people who are likely to be attacked are themselves, afraid to speak. The experience of CreepyPMs in keeping their site open, friendly and inclusive, using 30 moderators for a relatively small site and a tough policy where in essence that comments must be conductive to a supportive environment and if not, can be removed, even if they have not violated a specific rule, seems to potentially curtail freedom of speech and could silence valid criticism but can also "allow marginalised and targeted individuals who are not likely to share their stories or opinions when the door is left open to the rest of the world" to speak. https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.

__label__Attack	This article summarises it well https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.

Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	I agree, newspapers should remain impartial as much as possibe and outsource the management to a third party that most consumers of media can agree on to form that structure for defining and removing comments.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Support	I totally agree, it will create more positive experiences to readers if it is removed.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	re-education will not help some people	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people.

I see that most people have the same idea as I have of having moderated. I did not think about what the guidelines could be and how censoring could be a contributing factor to my stand on having comments moderated, but it still seems like the best solution.
__label__Attack	Removing the comments limits speech, it goes against our freedom	I think filtering hate speech comments can do that and allowing a better more positive and a welcome experience to all readers.

The rights and liberties of journalists and their role in fostering and developing peaceful societies should be emphasized in media ethics education. The political, social, and cultural rights of individuals and groups, including the freedom of expression, must be made more widely known, as well as the obligations and societal repercussions that come with press freedom. Journalists need to have the knowledge and abilities to spot hate speech and disseminate anti-hate messaging.

__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Support	I agree	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	Hate speech is bad and must not be tolarated	Hate speech must be banned totally from the online publications.
__label__Support	I would love to think that we could screen every comment written about every article but it is simply not realistic. Removing the platform that gives power to hate comments is the best solution. I understand that people want free speech, but i do not see this idea manifesting seamlessly	Monitoring of comment areas is not realistic
__label__Attack	As technology becomes more advanced, there are algorithms that detect hate speech, for example on Twitter. People can also report hateful comments so that only appropiate comments are left.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	According to a recent survey by Morningconsult, 80% of people want to see all forms of hate speech removed. https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/social-media-firms-moderate-content/	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	I feel they do have a responsibility to monitor trolling and abusive behaviour as this can be harmful to others. A modern legal test of the legitimacy of proposed restrictions on freedom of speech was stated in the opinion by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. in Schenk v. U.S. (1919): a restriction is legitimate only if the speech in question poses a “clear and present danger”—i.e., a risk or threat to safety or to other public interests that is serious and imminent.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way.

So maybe it is too fastidious	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	This would require a special team to supervise the comment section at all times which might be costly.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	Moderation can be timely and expensive and then you wouldn't see comments in real time	I think that someone should be assigned as a moderator who assesses comments before they are posted to ensure they don't contain any offensive information
__label__Support	This should prevent the majority of hate speech to be eliminated.	I think that someone should be assigned as a moderator who assesses comments before they are posted to ensure they don't contain any offensive information
__label__Attack	-links showing other sites are a great way to show hateful infos in a coversation	https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3394231.3397902
__label__Support	That is actually a good idea, but gives a lot of power to the moderators.	I believe hate speech should be moderated and perhaps shadow-banned. That way users who post comments which are marked by the moderators as hate speech would never know they were banned and would not create new accounts or post more hateful comments.
__label__Support	"hate speech has been identified as a common precursor to atrocity crimes, including genocide"	https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-and-real-harm
__label__Attack	I think using AI would not prove to be very effective. If this AI was to be self-supervised (without any moderators) I think it would quickly start flagging not-hateful comments as hate speech since it's very susceptible to user input - see what happened to Microsoft's Twitter bot Tay. After a couple of weeks, if I'm not mistaken, the AI started posting very hateful tweets about the holocaust and minorities.	By using moderators or AI to police the posts

__label__Attack	As much as I would *like to* agree, I unfortunately cannot. Free speech still IS a part of free speech. I'm afraid you can't have one or the other - they are co-dependent as I believe, humans are inherently seeking conflict.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	I absolutely agree with that position. As much as I hope and believe people should not resort to hate speech, but rather have a civilized conversation and respect each other's opinions, I am aware people might simply not be capable of that. Also - hate speech is not illegal in most countries. Quote from Wikipedia: "While "hate speech" is not a legal term in the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that most of what would qualify as hate speech in other western countries is legally protected free speech under the First Amendment."

__label__Attack	I used to moderate a forum. The administrator set up various parameters for keyword triggers.

Have slurs programmed in as keywords so that comments which feature them are not published.
__label__Support	This would help the content management team not have to answer every mail about comments.	The algorithm should have code that detects certain hate speech words and shadow bans them so as they do not appear on the site. with a warning that it will happen if the post is posted.
__label__Attack	This may be challenging for newspaper websites with large audiences and therefore a great deal of traffic (which is a likely goal for most/all newspaper companies). The volume of new comments following a breaking story would likely be quite great and the task would very taxing for moderators. If the proportion of content that is hateful is quite high, you may be looking at quite a bit of burnout amongst the moderators who may quickly grow cynical, jaded, and emotionally exhausted from filtering out so much hatred and profanity.	The best way to curb hate speech would be to have the comments section moderated for any forms of hate speech.

__label__Support	I agree, there should be a policy on what is considered hate speech therefore making easy to censor hate speech	There should be some level of censoring to eliminate hate speech, but not to the extent where comments are totally disabled
__label__Attack	Have you actually read the comments on a newspaper article!	I strongly feel that comments are an essential part of the readers experience.

__label__Attack	You may argue that it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police their comment sections. Having said that, perhaps the relevant question you should be asking is whether it is in their best interests to do so. That is, even if it's not their moral obligation, it may STILL be in their financial and functional best interest to do so. The prevalence and salience of hate speech may signal to audiences that the newspaper tolerates (at best) and endorses (at worst) the hateful commentary appearing in their comment section. How do you think this would impact the bottom-line of the bottom line of said newspaper company? I would argue: Not well. And how do you think this would impact the ability of said newspaper to reach future audiences? I would argue: Not well. Individuals disgusted by the appearance of hate speech may be at an increased probability of avoiding said newspaper website in the future on moral grounds.

This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__Attack	Do you believe that a newspaper comment section is an appropriate system for dialogue with someone spreading hateful messages?	I think that education is the way to go about it, Humans must respect opposing views of others and tolerant society should be encouraged at all times instead of censorship
__label__Attack	removing comments section is never going to encourage tolerance it is	Readers should be able to comment but be informed of certain comments that would be considered hate speech.

Freedom of speech includes allowing people to talk about their opinions, but not threatening people or expressing prejudice against certain groups.	I am unsure if there is a way to reduce hate speech. One persons 'hate speech' is anothers 'freedom of speech'.

Their broad discretion stems from the Communications Decency Act. The 1996 law exempts tech platforms from liability for actionable speech by their users.

__label__Support	Unmoderated online comment forums are magnets for noxious speech. For years they have carried people’s discontent out into the world, while the writers sit safely behind screens. It’s almost bittersweet to think back on the time we once blamed internet flaming on the online disinhibition of middle school pranksters. It is the many unhappy adults in the electorate who are posting the things they are really thinking in comment boxes. Nearly three-quarters of internet users – 73 percent – have witnessed online harassment. News website comment sections host antagonistic conversations between contributors. Nine out of 10 respondents of a Pew Research study said the online environment was more enabling of criticism. The squabbling can be overwhelming: As many as 34 percent of news commenters and 41 percent of news comment readers identified argumentative comments as the reason they avoid reading or joining the discourse. Multiple studies show online communities develop sophisticated norms that guide participants. Anger begets more anger. Unshackled digital vitriol is now volleyed back and forth online from all sides. Some commenters don’t even care if they are anonymous anymore. Researchers have found real-name comments on social media are actually nastier than unsigned commentary. Historically, American democracy always had some rudeness baked into it. For example, during the presidential election of 1800, incumbent President John Adams’ campaign proclaimed “murder, robbery, rape, adultery and incest will all be openly taught and practiced” if his opponent, Thomas Jefferson, won the presidency. Jefferson, meanwhile, described Adams as “a hideous hermaphroditical character,” with “neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman.” Civility in public discourse is often what people in power expect of their citizens. Demands for civility can be used by those with authority to deny power to those with none. People who feel marginalized or alienated use incivility and civil disobedience to fight the power. By causing offense and indignation, as we saw during Campaign 2016, outsiders gained massive attention for their cause. Yet “democracy only functions when its participants abide by certain conventions, certain codes of conduct and a respect for the process,” wrote cultural journalist Neal Gabler in an eloquent essay about how a hateful electorate threatens democracy. Gabler noted that the 2016 presidential campaign was referred to as the “hate election” because everyone professed to hate both candidates. It turned out to be the hate election, Gabler mused, “because of the hatefulness of the electorate.” He went on:https://theconversation.com/how-news-sites-online-comments-helped-build-our-hateful-electorate-70170	This is not just a newspaper comment section problem... it's a social media problem as well, more like an internet problem.

__label__Support	yes, hate speech criteria should be overlooked and set by a credible outside source.	the best way is for companies to filter hate speech and remove it as long as the criteria for hate speech comes from an independent organisation. If companies themselves govern what is hate speech then we would become subject to there rules which you would lose the point of freedom of speech. Also there should be more support in the community for people who are being targeted in hate speech attacks.
__label__Attack	I think this should be done by a real person, as using a computer, some hateful words can be disguised and still get through	Hate speech can be controlled by blacklisting keywords on the search engine of a particular blog post/newspapers which will delete any comments that may contain any of the blacklisted keywords.
__label__Attack	If the information was moderated & hidden if deemed to be hate speech then it would still exist for the purposes of feedback but not be visible within the comments section	Ultimately the comments are needed to gather feedback in certain situations, removing the comments section wouldn't help us eliminate hate speech because where information needs to be gathered, no blacklist will help.

__label__Support	I really liked the identity verification requirement	There should be a strict comment management system in place, someone has to supervise it and react (and possibly penalise) to users spreading hate speech.

__label__Attack	I think this solution can be very intrusive. Especially in a times where our personal data is being collected as a commodity.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them.

__label__Support	I think in the cases of newspapers, the hateful comments can be removed before print. If it's an online platform then said user can be shadowed	This is a win or loose situation.

The newspaper can still allow for readers comment however, the hate speech comments can be filtered. This is a democratic world and people have a right to have an opinion in what becomes available to them
__label__Attack	Yes people are very technological savvy and capable of using fake accounts to continue spreading whatever comments without consideration and that makes it hard to trace them.	Removing hate speech comments is also not a good thing because with the technology that we have, people will go and create fake accounts and still go back to comment hatefully and disrespecting words of which it will be a daunting task to delete all the comments

Actually replying to that comment as the newspaper will show everyone else that it really is not okay	I think we firstly have to call out hate speech in order for people to learn that it is not okay and unacceptable. The reason being online 'haters' tend to abuse their right to free speech such that it infringes upon the next person because they have the comfort of knowing that nobody will find put who they really are and confront them.

__label__Support	I actually really like this idea - it deals well with the issue of removing hate speech as nothing just gets automatically published and checked later.

Some hate speech is actually illegal, so that should definitely be reported and removed. https://www.report-it.org.uk/reporting_internet_hate_crime
__label__Support	Agreed	Space on comments is a must have because many users get to participate into a good course that could help many others and therefore those spewing hate should be harshly dealt with. Blocked actively so
__label__Support	I agree, Article 19 of the ICCPR guarantees the right to freedom of expression but also disallows discrimination. Restricting any sort of speech violates the right to freedom of expression and can be utilised by leadership or publications to discriminate. https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/international-covenant-civil-and-political-rights	One user by the name of AndreaP said in order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section Newspapers should be one sided providers. I strongly disagree with this argument. It is very autocratic and happens a lot in countries where media and citizens does not have freedom and oppressed by harsh leadership. Comments in newspapers help many to get raw information from the ground and open minds of many to see issues differently from differing opinions. Indeed comments section are necessary
__label__Support	The only way hate speech can be combatted is through open debate. Any restrictions on speech by the newspaper have the implication it could restrict this open debate and allow those with hateful comments to become isolated and potentially commit violence if their views go unchallenged.

__label__Attack	Disagree. I think that newspapers have always been allowed to 'sell' information, but news sites do so at their own risk by eliminating vast swaths of subscribers and advertisers. A good reliable newspaper is also the best long term business model	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship.

__label__Support	I agree that this question is subjective to an extent - news matter varies and can often be divisive or challenge certain views. However, I think moderation could first take into account the relevancy of certain comments (i.e. personal quips, etc.).

__label__Support	You are right. it is the people who do not know, what they are taking about, they make problems	Removing the comment section will not solve the problem. It will just create a filling of censorship and will make debate and dialogue vanish. It is important that people discuss news topics and also give feedback on those news to the newspaper.

Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__Support	I think this is a good point. I hadn't thought about moderator bias.	By moderating the comment section. Instead of having an individual who may be biased in their moderation, the use of an artificial intelligence software can be introduced to moderate the comment section.

__label__Attack	I agree over-censorship is a negative, but there are laws about hate speech that should be upheld.	The is no need to moderate comments they must be dished out raw as they are writen by the readers
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.

Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it.

__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__Attack	Perhaps but a well defined policy by the newspaper should be able to indicate what is and is not allowed	Short answer is you can't, as the term 'hate speech' is incredibly vague, and can differ from person to person.
__label__Support	Definitely, it can be very polarising in itself with a definition and cause more issue if the wrong thing is removed	What is characterised as hate speech needs to be assessed on a case by case basis. It is not absolute
__label__Attack	I agree most with this post, there's no reason to allow hate speech to exist on social platforms when it's so easy to moderate and control	Research has shown that hate speech can be effectively controled since freedom of speech is not absolute
__label__Support	more online platform needs a moderator role, too often you see posts on social media that have rampant hate speech going unfiltered and the commenter going unpunished	There is a careful balance to be made between protecting others from the effects of hate speech and protecting free speech. Online hate speech unfortunately can have the effect of increasing violence against minorities (https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons) but blocking all free speech because of the actions of a few seems like a poor decision. More must be done to remove hate speech online quickly and this means spending more money tackling it.

Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

The best way to achieve an ability to comment on online newspaper articles and websites is to allow free speech but to regulate comments so as to avoid nasty hate speech, people then making such hateful comments could then be blocked from further comments.	Hire moderators and similar positions, and also having filtering systems
__label__Attack	I agree with this, as it creates a more safe space for everyone	By implimenting a system that can filter out all comments before the comments are added to the website or newspaper for the readers to read
__label__Support	It would certainly be effective as there's a team solely focused on that.	I still think a filtering system of removing categorically hateful words could help a little, but there is still the big problem of other comments bypassing that. I think an independant and unbiased moderation team could help to remove the issue of the newspapers removing valid critisism or comments about inaccurate reporting for example.

__label__Support	I agree with this statement. All hate speech can be removed if being monitored properly.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	I think people having to give personal data will make people think before they post hate speech or negative comments.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__Attack	Newspapers are nationally available.As are there websites.Whilst newspapers cant be held responsible for the comments of its readers ,i do think they should have a moderater to delete harmfull posts that could offend.

Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender.

__label__Support	I don't think it will make a difference. People will comment elsewhere. Fake news spreads more rapidly on social media than from the comments section of a newspaper website. I think the whole issue is being over thought.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Attack	Great! I have a similar approach	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__Support	I agree muting certain offensive words can have an impact on how much hate speech gets through on the website	Ensuring there are rules to adhere to, perhaps muting certain offensive words or phrases. Making sure commnect sections are heavily monitored.

__label__Attack	I don't think we will ever fully get rid of hate speech on these platforms unfortunately however more close monitoring could decrease it, as well as sanctions for those who write the hate speech.	My position as a reader and my argument is that bases on the rules of speech people have freedom of speech and expression. That should be done in a proper way without insulting others or hating or being racist in your speech. Websites and newspapers should not remove the comments of the people responding to hate speech. This is done according to the rules found in the following article: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks.

There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__Attack	That could help, although that would take a long of time. Also at the end of the day, whoever writes hateful speech do not see the dangers of what they are doing. According to an article in The Guardian, some people think this is just the internet and it does not reflect true life.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__Attack	I believe you are referencing an AI, but that would require certain technology and datasets for it to understand what to look for.

For example, there could be a bot or something (I do not know the exact name) that checks for any hateful words and eliminate that comment.
__label__Support	I share the same opinion on that having a bot that can check for hate speech is the way either block users who use hate speech or put them on time out.

__label__Attack	I agree,the should be someone who's hired to check comment and to block.Also those who bully people shoul not be allowed on the site	I think newspapers websites should have an online system that can detect hate speech and block users that use this kind of language but keeping it open for negative or positive feedback would be fair but not giving readers the freedom to use hate speech.
__label__Attack	Not allowing hateful comment does not mean we limit people freedom of speech but promote kindness.	Although it would be fair to allow for both critical and positive input, I believe that newspaper websites should have a mechanism in place that can identify hate speech and restrict individuals who use it.

__label__Attack	The problem with allowing commentary to flourish without restrictions is that it can undermine the credibility of legitimate news sources. Frank Waddell, associate journalism professor at the University of Florida, noted that “If you see a bunch of individuals online who are leaving negative comments on a news article, you might think most people are evaluating this news as low quality,” Waddell said. “When asked to evaluate the news yourself, you might also think the news is more negative relative to someone who reads that same article without comments.” https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/	human rights of the masses should not be violated regardless of their beliefs and views

__label__Attack	While I see the logic to this argument, the publics interaction with paper newspapers and slower press looks to have declined according to this article, therefore I'm not sure this solution would work: https://clubs.waketech.edu/wake-review/magazine/creative-writing/non-fiction/the-decline-in-newspapers-a-closer-look-joseph-ahrens/	Newspapers and free speech functioned well for a couple of hundred years without instant comments. People used to write letters to the newspaper, including their name. The newspaper would then publish some letters anonymously.

__label__Attack	I disagree and believe that other views should be respected and be allowed to be aired. If we only read one particular newspaper then our view will become one sided, with a comments section arguing different points, then it opens us up to many other arguments.

__label__Support	Firtly, i think the newpaper need to acknowledge the concern of hate speech. And is importnant because we can never fully avoid it. So the newspaper should have a platform support people who are targets of hate speech.	Filter words so if a comment contains this word it will be reviewed as to if it is appropriate or automatically deleted
__label__Attack	This works in terms of removing literal slurs from the platform, but doesn't account for when hate speech is more well-disguised or nebulous - how could we expect an automatic system to understand a dogwhistle?

So, the hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by removing comments with hate speech or having a software that can identify hate speech in a comment before it is posted.

I think the best way to deal with hate speech is to have filtered comments, raising awareness and age restrictions on wensites and comment sections
__label__Support	Should reduce Trolls	I think that the idea of users submitting personal data before making a comment can have positive and negative effects - positive in the sense that the user may think twice before posting hate speech and that they can be tracked down and educated; negative in the sense that the user could be on a website that wants to use user's personal data for the wrong reasons. I am still of the view that comments with hate speech need to be filtered out because each individual needs to be responsible in their speech.
__label__Support	A way to deal with this could be starting laws against hate speech or have punishments in place.	There is no cure for hate speech, but there is a way to stand up against it. Speak out against hate speech - fight racism and bigotry with love, empathy, compassion, and strength. We may not be able to eliminate hatred entirely, but the more steps we can take to educate and support human beings, and speak out against injustice, the better this world will become.

__label__Support	freedom of speech and opinion to the articles the news we read.	In my opinion the comment section should not be removed. I personally get very annoyed if I watch or read something and want to express my opinion, then go down to the comment section to sadly find out the comments are turned off. This limits the freedom of speech and blocks the ability for the people to vent out somehow. I think this builds aggression and causes problems afterwards. The better thing to do is to limit bad speech, foul words and cursing but removing the comments completely is not a good idea.
__label__Attack	Not necessarily. I think opinions are okay but not when it is hate and discrimination. Thinking morally that is wrong and shouldn't be allowed on any type of platform.	We live in a democratic society and so people have the right to their opinions. They just need to be voiced in the right way

I was completely taken aback by some strong stances to remove the comment space, and the belief in that because Newspapers should be one-sided providers.

Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

Though total ignorance would also be unfair, so really we need a position of just LESS attention and care given to such perspectives.
__label__Attack	There could be a risk with this. In an article from 2016 (https://www.jstor.org/stable/44014621) Flaxman et al. make the following point in their abstract: 'the vast majority of online news consumption is accounted for by individuals simply visiting the home pages of their favorite, typically mainstream, news outlets'. If this is the case, it's possible that the 'diverse' opinions will be in a cycle of one sided shared opinions, and few 'other' or opposed opinions. These could well end up being quite extreme, and the policy to include other opinions could well serve the opposite function of promoting hate speech when it is a massive minority.....maybe.	Control what is printed or posted to make sure that it is diverse and does not contain any hate speech but the message they are trying to get across they are able to. That way newspaper can leave the comment section and different opinions are heard and expressed and no one gets hurt.
__label__Attack	This sounds like a very expensive solution - I think maybe more time and money should be spent on algorithms that can do the same thing	create a team of people that can look for and remove the hate speech and leave all other respectful arguments to make the comment section diverse.
__label__Attack	I disagree! There could errors in implanting this to begin with and it may discourage them from using it, and therefore these products in general. I feel a dedicated team for tackling this matter or if a smaller company general overseers from time to time would be better and also hold a more human opinion on whether it is deemed hate or not.	Websites should invest in software to remove hate speech, this would allow for healthy debate without racist or descrimination.
__label__Attack	I agree with you on the fact the media controlling what we view can be untrustworthy and outright terrifying, however in the view of hate speech and affecting the health of authors and committed readers mentally factors in more greatly than this, in my personal opinion.	The idea that media should be able to stop a conversation is wrong and this is what would happen if comments were removed.
__label__Support	Again, good point. Maybe there should be a daily limit on how many posts can be removed? (In order to avoid publishers becoming reliant on retrospective fixing, rather than their initial checks - which are where the problem originates).	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.

__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	I agree with this statement. When we didn't have any computers, people didn't have the luxury to comment instantly.

__label__Attack	I still think newspapers hold quite a bit of merit when it comes to what they post.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy

__label__Attack	Newspapers are not supposed to be one-sided in the first place; they're supposed to give all the information, which will include different viewpoints by nature to avoid bias. This seems like a slippery-slope to accepting journalists' opinions as fact.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	This could work	More emphasis on moderation of specific language would reduce the risk of hate speech. Also, moderators approving comments before they appear on the website would help.
__label__Attack	But are moderators available to this? And who agrees what can be said and what can't be?	More emphasis on moderation of specific language would reduce the risk of hate speech. Also, moderators approving comments before they appear on the website would help.
__label__Attack	The thing is if people filter these comments, they may not work as accurate as AI. For example, they may use their own judgements to decide if something is appropriate. If we use AI, we can simply add new filters, like words or phrases, AI will filter all comments in the way we "teach" it.	I think the first step to reducing hate speech in readers comments should be in the form of a moderation team in which they filter inappropriate comments. I think it should be a group of people rather than AI to do this to ensure all hate speech within a variety of contexts are eliminated, as if this was done by a computer there is risk of hate spilling through. For example, hate speech on the social media platform Twitter can often be missed as users purposefully misspell hateful speech to ensure it does not flag up on the AI searches, going as far as hateful language misspelt actually trending on Twitter.
__label__Support	I agree, it is just what I said.	It is not fair if newspapers take away the comment space. I do not consider this to be fair choice in a supposed democratic society/
__label__Attack	This article (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17512786.2013.859838?casa_token=V_anYAQrBCIAAAAA%3A8IhQZy8qfCjnjwaIRbnec33KKLtJ-bMtB2hlHbj2F-zaeHbi--55gbSq8lsDIkCmhmSQE1khpVZRD9M) states that comments are integral to keeping news fresh and discussed. Having news discussed by people is what sparks change in our society, so they are still important and probably shouldn't be removed!	I think in order to eliminate hate speech, the comment section itself must be completely eradicated to take a way all potential risk. Newspapers have the sole purpose of giving accurate depictions of current events, there is no responsibility for them to offer social commentary space. One only has to look at the hatred filled comments of the Daily Mail web pages to see the concerning language being used on a regular basis.
__label__Attack	I would agree, but this article (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0163443712472089?casa_token=FJm_UB0wIqEAAAAA%3ALr9dI-lrHJemMa9XgBVkx8tCkSQUSUAg14owxExDkpThv0tpIu6LJySR_p7EJ_lPqQbiATTxEfULs7k) states that filtering racism doesn't really stop racism, it just encourages it to go elsewhere. Maybe it will protect sites that use it, but otherwise, people will still find racism online. And maybe that's not the responsibility of the news site, but I find it disheartening still.	In summary, I think we should not remove comment sections. We need to "teach" AI to filter the comment section on newspaper websites. In that way, we can add or remove filters, and AI will simply do the work of making sure the comment section is appropriate. People should not get involved to directly filter comments, they may not be fair at all.

__label__Attack	Right to free speech isn't necessarily a right to a platform or a publisher. Before the internet, people weren't entitled to have their comments on the news stapled inside a copy of the paper. They were just able to express their opinions on it independently, to family or coworkers, or by writing their own publication in response. I'm not sure if newspapers simply choosing not to publish readers' comments (which is what they are doing by hosting those comments on their site) is the same as censoring free speech. By this logic, anyone who writes a poorly written opinion piece and submits it to the New York Times should get it published, because otherwise their speech is oppressed.	I do not think it is possible, in a fair and just way. When speech is restricted that's called censorship. Who would justify the restrictive opinion?

__label__Attack	What is considered free speech (and should therefor be allowed) depends heavily on the location of the platform and the user. In the US free speech is protected by law to a much greater extend than in Europe. In the US there are only a few categories of speech not protected by the First Amendment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_free_speech_exceptions), like incitement to lawless action. In Europe however free speech stops there where it infringes on someone else their rights, for example the right to not be discriminated against. Racism and targeted hate for that reason is not protected by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights) or the national laws of many of the European countries.

__label__Support	This definitely needs human input, it's too sensitive a matter for machines!	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	Flagging comments does work with limited effectiveness, however, like with social media, you will always invite people who want to censor anything they disagree with.

__label__Support	I completely agree. It's not the job of online sites to become speech police. I frequent many different online comment sections, and oddly enough, hateful comments are swiftly dealt with by other contributors. Sometimes the best way to eliminate hate speech, is to allow it to be seen, then vastly condemned by those seeing it. Algorithms should be used to deal with trolling. Honest, sometimes brutal comments should not censored just because they make others uncomfortable.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted.

__label__Support	I think the practicalities of providing identity verification could be tricky. For instance, you could have people attempting to pose as others and posting inflammatory statements.	A possible way to address hate speech on newspaper sites would be to incorporate both human moderators and some sort of AI that monitors for hateful words and comments. The requirement to submit personally identifying information before commenting might also help because without this then anyone can create a fake name that hides the person's true identity so therefore more likely to engage in hate speech. If personal information is required, then hate speech would be less likely.

As per 'The Free Speech Balancing Act of Digital Intermediaries: An explication of the concept of content governance' (Johnson, Brett (2015)' online news outlets face several competing duties: to promote free speech, to prevent harm, to obey the law, and to make money. Their entire business model relies on discourse and to prevent that is to deny readers/users the very service they claim to be providing. Some kind of voting system would allow harmful comments to be surpressed by the users themselves. It should really be left to the platforms themselves to figure out a way to manage potential hate speech (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00550-7#Sec4) through their own platforms as they have a responsibility to both limit harmful speech but keep discussion free and open.

The way to fairly reduce hate speech is to use a mix of technology and human intervention to manage the potential volume of moderation required to provide a healthy environment for discussion. There are a number of tools available that allow for pre- and post-moderation to curb the worst excesses of user comments. This can be further enhanced by requiring readers to give a little more data about themselves to reduce the anonymity which provides a cloak for the potentially worst expressions of hatred.
__label__Attack	The reason why I disagree is because removing the comment sections unable readers from expressing their view and opinions on certain topics covered in the newspaper.

The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them.

Allowing people to post their opinions is healthy and a normal part of human society- people will not always agree. However, in order to reduce hate speech, which can so often lead to crime, it could be done so that there are monitors (either human or computer) who check comments before they are posted to ensure they are not hate speech.
__label__noRel	The newspapers aren't reading consumer input though. The only people reading the comments section are other consumers.

I have read through some of the cooments and my stance is still the same. It is no doubt that hate speech is a problem, however, not allowing the public the opportunity to comment on issues may not only be a problem against freedom of speech, it may also cause the newspaper to lose some of its loyal readers if they're not able to engage with the content shared by the newspaper.

__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	While freedom of speech is a human right, it is imperative to be cognizant of the fact that each and every person has the right to have their rights respected.

__label__noRel	I agree that this question is subjective to an extent - news matter varies and can often be divisive or challenge certain views. However, I think moderation could first take into account the relevancy of certain comments (i.e. personal quips, etc.). Bullying or other clearly offensive comments (racist, sexist, ableist etc.) contributes nothing to a discussion, so it should be moderated. Comments that lend to the wider argument (however contrasting) should be regulated at the newspaper's own discretion.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others.

__label__noRel	yes definately, removal of the section is an infringement rather find a way to navigate around sensitive or hate speech comments. maybe burn subscription of that particular individual	There should be some filters to remove bad comments
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	I agree with Dominic , who becomes judge of what is true, what is without bias, what is hateful versus what is simply disagree, disapprove, dislike. Do we say happy things only and simply create artifical safe spaces where only positive ego boosting comments are allowed?	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	I believe some sort of regulation in media will always be necessary to decrease the damage hate speech might cause -- comments space included.

__label__noRel	I agree with this. The trick is how to select unbiased moderators. They have to go by a guideline	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	I like the idea of controversial opinions still being available to see other perspectives, but not being forced to see them if you don't want to.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	This would minimise the amount of time that potential hateful comments can be seen	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	Comments should be regulated, but comment space should not be removed.
__label__noRel	It is possible to express opinions without being aggressive, but that doesn't mean people will do so.

Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	I agree it is an individual's responsiblity to choose their words carefully, and if they don't then their comments, or eventually if they persist, their accounts should be removed.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	Hiding them could be a good idea as it allows a log of this person, and could even allow possible banning of people from the platform if they use it in a bad way	I don't think any attempts should be made to block or censor anything.

__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	I've gone over most opinions on this topic. The best solution would be a bot that would filter out the harmful comments
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is often used as a reason not to have readers comments. It seems that this is not a fair argument for eliminating readers comments because of the psychological phenomenon of "cognitive dissonance" - we automatically search for echo chambers in any context.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	Maybe the only solution is to remove the space for comments? We see the same issues on other platforms that allow comments!
__label__noRel	Whilst I think that removing comments wouldn't fix hate speech, surely it would definitely diminish it and isn't that better than no solution at all?	online newspaper will definately attract a lot of people if there is comment section as some people prefer to go through comments first to get insight of the content.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	i think a law should be made that if you do not delete hate speech from your website or article than that newspaper will have to pay a fine.
__label__noRel	Algorithms also have issues and can be inherently racist: https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/18/21121286/algorithms-bias-discrimination-facial-recognition-transparency	A combination of a warning system, detailing what might be considered hate speech and a manual review if potential hate speech is detected as well as on manual reports (allowing brief descriptions for reasons for reporting) seems like a good way to go about it. People who have a history of posting more than one hate comment on the platform should be moderated each time before their comment gets publicised whether it's detected as hate speech by the algorithm or not. They would lose the privilege of being able to comment instantly without review.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way.

__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.

__label__noRel	I think the fact that Facebook, one of the richest companies in the world, struggle with moderation points to the fact that small local newspapers would struggle.

I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__noRel	Yes, algorithms developed alongside the countries law makers and governing bodies could help reduce legally defined hate speech without making room for petty vendetas or the silencing of free speech.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	i suppose that for those who do listen and pay attention that this is a good idea as it allows for the idea of freedom of speech aslong as everyone knows what they are saying and how it can effect people	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	You would need to detect which accounts are using hate speech and ban them from writing posts
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	Readers should be able to comment but be informed of certain comments that would be considered hate speech. If they are aware and still choose to comment hateful words, the newspaper website should feel comfortable enough to remove those comments since the reader was informed that comments like those would not be acceptable.
__label__noRel	not focusing on the interconnection between free speech and hate crime	We need to let people have their opinions spoken. Removing the comment space is not a good option. Instead, we need to better educate people on what's good and what's bad.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Make readers agree to not sharing hate speech and let them know that if they do, they will be blocked from commenting.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	I'm a firm believer of freedom of speech therefore eliminating it in any form especially because of something that can be regulated like hate speech, to me is ridiculous.
__label__noRel	A good point, a lot of memes may be seen as offensive and may be flagged as such. There is the man I saw on the news who made a video for YouTube and made his dog do an offensive stance as a joke and ended up with prison time, it depends on how far a joke could go and the stance of those seeing the joke. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-43478925	Removing hate speech comments is also not a good thing because with the technology that we have, people will go and create fake accounts and still go back to comment hatefully and disrespecting words of which it will be a daunting task to delete all the comments
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	Perhaps newspapers could use similar tools to respondology (https://respondology.com/ ) or hive moderation (https://hivemoderation.com ) that can identify and block hateful speech. This might well work and I think both of these use AI.
__label__noRel	yes true i find no one really reads those comments anyways	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	I think comments should be limited and all negative comments should be blocked
__label__noRel	flagging comments would be an easier way	I think the best way to reduce hate speech in newspaper websites is to ensure that the site can detect words and phrases that can be considered hate speech, and block them from being posted on the comment section. Also, a moderator to approve each comment section before it becomes publicly accessible is a notion which can be adopted as well.

Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	I simply do not agree with your views Andrea. How can anyone living, or wanting to live in a democratic world want to actively curtail free speech in any form. I have done a little online research tonight and it seems my argument can be backed up by various articles and sources. Such as this one https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/	Not possible to to it completely, hate spech can be quite subtle. Needs real time moderation.
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	Removing the comment section should not be an option, we should not lose the right to freedom of speech based on the likelihood that a few may post hateful comments, strict moderation and being able to report hate speech is the solution. Having people sign up for platforms and use ID to which they could be held personally accountable is an option as well. Hate Speech often comes from being able to hide behind a keyboard, screen and a fake username.
__label__noRel	i agree, people who repeatadly post negative hateful comments need to have suspensions and bans	People should be told about hate speech and how it affects other people and I think people who participate in hate speech should have some sort of panishment.
__label__noRel	I completely agree, it will help avoid people posting offensive comments and allow the comment section space to be a space of productiveness where we learn what our fellow communities think about articles posted	It can be done by using algorithms

__label__noRel	I agree	Have them reviewed after they are posted and do not allow them to be viewed before they are revied, as well as keeping tabs on the user posting the comments.
__label__noRel	Eliminating space for readers in its entirety removes any possibility of stimulating discussion. While hate speech is a serious consideration, I would hope that it forms a small minority of the comments posted on newspaper websites (but I guess this also depends on the topic since some are more charged than others). Surely some form of regulation would suffice to address the severity of hate speech.	Removing the comment section will not solve the problem. It will just create a filling of censorship and will make debate and dialogue vanish. It is important that people discuss news topics and also give feedback on those news to the newspaper. It is important to moderate this comments in a strict no hate speech way and bring accountability in. Eliminating comments will just hide a problem that needs to be fixed by moderating and educating people.
__label__noRel	limitations are important.	My position as a reader and my argument is that bases on the rules of speech people have freedom of speech and expression. That should be done in a proper way without insulting others or hating or being racist in your speech. Websites and newspapers should not remove the comments of the people responding to hate speech. This is done according to the rules found in the following article: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230
__label__noRel	That's true. Most social media companies are already using AI to detect and remove hate speech. Here's an article about this: https://www.newsy.com/stories/artificial-intelligence-is-used-to-track-down-hate-speech/	Allow users to report comments.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	I'm not sure if it will work but they can put a sign on the website that says no to hate comments allowed. Or a report button can also help then administrator can review the reported comments
__label__noRel	I agree with moderators and hate speech/report buttons. Also Thumbs up and thumbs down are good and helps people understand the popularity of other peoples' ideas/comments.	I think that readers who use hate speech should be reported and temporarily banned from the site, as I believe that we need comments section in online newspaper articles. It is important to share your views as we have freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	I believe the following article could provide more information on hate speech, not only in the context of this discussion but as a whole and what can be done to combat it. https://www.stompoutbullying.org/blog/hate-speech
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	I think we should just collect personal information. It works in South Korea. People will behave if their are not anonymous. Modertors are important too, but not enough,
__label__noRel	I agree with this statement. Updates can also be installed to reduce the number of inappropriate comments	By making people aware that hate speech is not good by creating awareness campaigns against hate specch.
__label__noRel	great comment, thanks for adding verified sources which strengthens these ideas	I think the best option would be to put some moderators that are educated about hateful speeches and let them see comments before they are online so that they can decide to approved them or not. They are doing it in Germany (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793)
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	I disagree with the stance of doing away with the comment section in its entirety, it goes against the premise of media which is to spark a debate or discussion.
__label__noRel	I share the same opinion on that having a bot that can check for hate speech is the way either block users who use hate speech or put them on time out.	user logins can allow for better regulation of comments
__label__noRel	different people will have different interpretations of 'disrespectful'	Flag known and "popular" derogatory terms automatically through the platform which does not allow you to post the comment without using the politically correct terms
__label__noRel	https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/04/1025742/ai-hate-speech-moderation/ It is (at least for the moment) not really possible for an AI to filter out hate speech efficiently. https://hai.stanford.edu/news/why-ai-struggles-recognize-toxic-speech-social-media	By having technology that can detect hate speech so that it can be blocked before it is posted.
__label__noRel	Reducing scam/spam profiles, or profiles just intended for hate speech protects vulnerable people.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	Yes, I think that readers can also downvote a comment or flag it so that it can be brought to the moderator's attention and they should take action within a specified time frame.	I believe the fairest way is the hardest way and that's to have a small group of people moderating REAL hate speech and spam. If someone wants to just use a racist term or promote their website, then these people's comment should be removed and they should be banned from commenting for a period of time. The idea to remove comments entirely is absurd as the news is not trustworthy enough to be the sole voice people hear. We need to hear other voices.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	as long as good moderators are in place, hate speech and disrespectful comments will be weeded out.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Removing the comment section all together is a fair point as news is meant to be fair and impartial. People share their opinions based on their biases and that's not what the news is for - that's what social media is for. But in this case allowing the comment section to remain would be great if people would not abuse the power to share freely by sharing hate speech and slander. us as humans need to be regulated by a set of rules in order to keep a functioning society and i think a filtered comment section is the solution.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.

__label__noRel	it is a great idea	Removing the comment section from online newspapers is not the answer. Allowing people to post their opinions is healthy and a normal part of human society- people will not always agree.

I still think a filtering system of removing categorically hateful words could help a little, but there is still the big problem of other comments bypassing that. I think an independant and unbiased moderation team could help to remove the issue of the newspapers removing valid critisism or comments about inaccurate reporting for example.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	hate speech online will always be there and we shouldn't focus on hate speech a lo because there will be a lot of positive comments
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Provide a clear definition on what is considered hate speech and eliminate those comments that fit in that definition
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	By simply monitoring the comments and blocking the negative ones and removing them
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	There needs to be a moderator who is reviewing the comments that are made, I see a lot of inappropriate comments posted to news stories on the comments section of the news articles on facebook that incite arguments and hate speech. This is not acceptable and should not be allowed to happen.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	The vast majority of digital news consumers - that is 76% in America, read comments sections. This means by removing them were missing a big chance at limiting the harmful effects of echo chambers and encouraging consumers to think critically and question things
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	I believe having the ability to read through the comments of other is very important when making decisions. The fact that monitoring is weak across most platforms is the biggest issue.	I think removing space for comments is not the solution because how else will people discuss the matter at hand or share their opinion. I think hate speech should be set to be hidden from being viewed instread.
__label__noRel	I agree	The best solution would be one that elegantly ties the reduction of hate speech in the comment section with no detrimental effect to the publics freedom of speech. This could be done by setting guidelines for hate speech, and also ensuring that the public provides identifying information such as their email address and especially their phone number. Both can be tracked to the person. To take it even further would be to be able to collect data such as ip addresses( with the commenters permission of course) when the person sends their comment so as to be able hold them accountable for any hate speech they send in. This will prevent people from using such language and hoping to hide under anonymity.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	This project takes the approach of counterspeech, whereby hateful comments are not removed, but instead responded to with alternative, police and non-aggressive comments. https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/counterspeech-better-way-tackling-online-hate
__label__noRel	I strongly agree with your opinion, however the reader comments need to be respect as a platform despite people having the right to freedom of speech.	The comment section needs to be moderated using some kind of filter to automatically filter any words on the banned list and then use a report system to flag up anything which tries to bypass this. This will allow a human moderator to quickly decide what can be kept and what needs action.
__label__noRel	In an ideal world perhaps, but how would you recognise 'hate speech' and police this in practical terms without infringing civil liberties and free speech.

__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	WHile the definition in general can apply to most types of hate speech, there is one flaw, which can be illustrated by the following statement: "I don't care about your race, religion or gender. I do not like you because you are an idiot (or stupid)". Is that hate speech or an expression of opinion?	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	I think the best way to reduce hate speech in newspaper websites is to ensure that the site can detect words and phrases that can be considered hate speech, and block them from being posted on the comment section. Also, a moderator to approve each comment section before it becomes publicly accessible is a notion which can be adopted as well.
__label__noRel	I agree the comment section is for everyone- but what else can we do. Evidence has shown that hate speech can lead to real life crimes, and that needs to be tackled.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	This might negatively affect the person/ people in the articles.	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it.

__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	have word filters

__label__noRel	one way would be to not let and comments be published until a moderator has checked each comment.	I think that any 'contributors' should have a profile and should not be allowed to use an alias. I also think that there should be moderators looking at every post before it is published online.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	The idea of using AI algorithms to combat hate speech is an attractive one. However, using experience of Facebook, it's clear that AI systems are still not advanced enough to undertake this task without human oversight. Facebook often censors posts or comments unfairly because its AI algorithms doesn't understand the context. In short, I don't believe we can get away without using humans to check the flagged comments at least.	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions

I tend to agree that newspapers should provide spaces for dicussion. It encourages people to read about the topic before making comments and peopel can easily reference reference the article in their comments. I think this allows for a more fruitful and productive discussion that on other platforms e.g. social media. However, hate speech is certainly an issue and easily derails conversations. While moderation of hate speech would be ideal, the burden on the newspaper is likely too great to do this manually. Perhaps a mixture of auto-moderation (flagging/removing key words), manual review by the newspaper and some form of community moderation may work well together.
__label__noRel	That will take too long time to do manually, so it's best to ban some words in the start. If the user is using to many of the banned words, then ban the user automatically.	Awareness campaigns need to be implemented to teach people about the significance of avoiding hate speech.

__label__noRel	Yes, I think that readers can also downvote a comment or flag it so that it can be brought to the moderator's attention and they should take action within a specified time frame.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__noRel	I agree	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	Proper moderation by the website owner should be required, whether using human moderators or using technology to flag potential hate speech for human review and action.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	I was completely taken aback by some strong stances to remove the comment space, and the belief in that because Newspapers should be one-sided providers. I would disagree because newspaper share societal information and society should be allowed to engage and be part of the conversation instead of just consuming whatever information is being released for consumption. It has been seen as a result of other newspaper websites removing the comment section that it reduces the trust of the reader because they are aware of the bias of the information they are consuming, and also it reduces the amount of time readers spend on these sites because there is no community engagements.

__label__noRel	Sadly I must agree. Ongoing monitoring of comments would take too much effort and time. It is simpler to just remove the comments and let the newspaper articles stand for themselves. Pople can always link the article to their own twitter post and comment there if they feel the need to add their own thoughts.	i do not agree with the method of doxxing people. hate speech has always existed, it is now on a more global scale because the world is more centralised as a result of social media. i believe the solution is censorship and moderation which sites like reddit and youtube already preactise.

Every person should be traceable, so they are accountable. If your comments consist of hate speech or are offensive then you be accounable.
__label__noRel	eliminating space for readers comments? is that the right approach?	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	Unmoderated online comment forums are magnets for noxious speech. For years they have carried people’s discontent out into the world, while the writers sit safely behind screens. It’s almost bittersweet to think back on the time we once blamed internet flaming on the online disinhibition of middle school pranksters. It is the many unhappy adults in the electorate who are posting the things they are really thinking in comment boxes. Nearly three-quarters of internet users – 73 percent – have witnessed online harassment. News website comment sections host antagonistic conversations between contributors. Nine out of 10 respondents of a Pew Research study said the online environment was more enabling of criticism. The squabbling can be overwhelming: As many as 34 percent of news commenters and 41 percent of news comment readers identified argumentative comments as the reason they avoid reading or joining the discourse. Multiple studies show online communities develop sophisticated norms that guide participants. Anger begets more anger. Unshackled digital vitriol is now volleyed back and forth online from all sides. Some commenters don’t even care if they are anonymous anymore. Researchers have found real-name comments on social media are actually nastier than unsigned commentary. Historically, American democracy always had some rudeness baked into it. For example, during the presidential election of 1800, incumbent President John Adams’ campaign proclaimed “murder, robbery, rape, adultery and incest will all be openly taught and practiced” if his opponent, Thomas Jefferson, won the presidency. Jefferson, meanwhile, described Adams as “a hideous hermaphroditical character,” with “neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman.” Civility in public discourse is often what people in power expect of their citizens. Demands for civility can be used by those with authority to deny power to those with none. People who feel marginalized or alienated use incivility and civil disobedience to fight the power. By causing offense and indignation, as we saw during Campaign 2016, outsiders gained massive attention for their cause. Yet “democracy only functions when its participants abide by certain conventions, certain codes of conduct and a respect for the process,” wrote cultural journalist Neal Gabler in an eloquent essay about how a hateful electorate threatens democracy. Gabler noted that the 2016 presidential campaign was referred to as the “hate election” because everyone professed to hate both candidates. It turned out to be the hate election, Gabler mused, “because of the hatefulness of the electorate.” He went on:	After doing some follow up reading from https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/what-is-online-hate-crime/ I have seen how the anonymity of these online comments can be what makes it so easy for people to be hateful. Therefore, an easy solution would be to make it impossible for people to comment anonymously, and have people have to provide personal information. However, I am not sure how this would work from a data protection point of view. It is certainly a start.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	Totally agree . Users all human beings after all
__label__noRel	The way to circumvent abuse of flagging is to create consequences for it. Being banned from the comments section in increments of time until someone is eventually permanently banned for too many infractions	I am proposing the use of AI to manage this space
__label__noRel	Really like that idea	i believe comment are important, to allow people to discuss. sometimes you can get factual information from other people comments
__label__noRel	people can no longer criticise	you can add an AI system in the website that will scan all comments instantly after they have been posted and it can remove any hate speech before it is seen by many people on the comment section, this method is used by some online communication platforms.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	Newspaper websites should also be held accountable if they do not deal with hate speech
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Some people will always use hate speech and hide behind their computer, There needs to be some sort of filter added to flag such comments and people and a ban put on the user

__label__noRel	I dont think you can use all means necessary to eradate hate speech. You can only control how you react to it	Addressing hate speech should not mean prohibiting freedom of speech which is what you will be doing if the comments' section is removed. Instead a way to reduce the hate speech from escalating into something dangerous must be sourced and implemented. https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/UN%20Strategy%20and%20Plan%20of%20Action%20on%20Hate%20Speech%2018%20June%20SYNOPSIS.pdf

__label__noRel	people naturally get angry so its difficult to reduce hate speech without any group being offended to some distinction	Newspaper comment spaces allow people the opportunity to share their opinions and feel that they can contribute their thoughts and ideas - it can also help readers engage with the content in a different way.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	I think that someone should be assigned as a moderator who assesses comments before they are posted to ensure they don't contain any offensive information

__label__noRel	This is a very good point. And will make the reading experience pleasant. Another method that can combat hate speech is education.

Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.

__label__noRel	Newspapers are a valid and beneficial space for comments	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	Yep. Rather implement ways in which one can refrain from hate speech	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	I agree	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.

__label__noRel	while free speech is our right and we are entitled to our own opinions, when you are promoting/endorsing hatred and discrimination of any sort, the line should be drawn. having a discussion/debate with opposing sides is normal and gives insight to both sides with little bias, but that cannot be used as an excuse to be hateful or discriminatory.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	There should be a strict comment management system in place, someone has to supervise it and react (and possibly penalise) to users spreading hate speech. The comments should not be anonymous since people feel more inclined to be hostile when hiding under a pseudonym.

__label__noRel	How do you propose to address the root causes?	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it.

In order for effective moderation to occur, some kind of consensus or clearly reachable policy on what constitutes hate speech (including dogwhistling, which may be less clear to a lay viewer) would need to be in place.

Education in media ethics: The first step in combating tribalized hate speech is realizing that, while the right to free expression is a fundamental human right, the rise of social media has produced a number of different channels for its creation, packaging, and transmission. The rights and liberties of journalists and their role in fostering and developing peaceful societies should be emphasized in media ethics education. The political, social, and cultural rights of individuals and groups, including the freedom of expression, must be made more widely known, as well as the obligations and societal repercussions that come with press freedom. Journalists need to have the knowledge and abilities to spot hate speech and disseminate anti-hate messaging.

Newspapers and free speech functioned well for a couple of hundred years without instant comments. People used to write letters to the newspaper, including their name. The newspaper would then publish some letters anonymously. This meant that people were protected but offered well considered opinions, rather than abusive or nasty comments. Perhaps a slower postal system encourages better behaviour rather than an amplified Twitter-esque school-yard of bullying and abuse.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	by never posting the hate speech words in the newspaper
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Eliminating the space for reader comments would be violating free speech, in my opinion it would be much better to have every incident recorded as a Non-crime hate incident'. The government needs to have stricter and clearer laws on what entails hate crime and hate incidents.	Removing the comment section should not be an option, we should not lose the right to freedom of speech based on the likelihood that a few may post hateful comments, strict moderation and being able to report hate speech is the solution. Having people sign up for platforms and use ID to which they could be held personally accountable is an option as well. Hate Speech often comes from being able to hide behind a keyboard, screen and a fake username.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	moderating the comments would surely help
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	AI could be the first step flagging any potential wording or offensive phrases and a human could doublecheck	I think that keeping a comment section is overall good as it keeps engagement but needs to be heavily moderated and regulated so it doesn't just dissolve into a lot of hate speech and grounds for radicalisation
__label__noRel	Some comments can be seen as hate speech but they are not hate speech. They will be taken down and that will prevent freedom of speech	The only way to combat hate speech is through open debate. Restricting any form of speech (even hate speech) could lead to hateful views becoming unchallenged and potentially result in violence. There is also the issue that newspapers could define hate speech as certain comments they don't like destroying any potential for open debate. By maintaining open debate hate speech can be called out and as a result, become less frequent.
__label__noRel	I think this is very important. Hate speech will drive away advertisers as they will not want to be associated with hateful comments. Newspapers will have to stop those comments to retain revenue. Facebook has started to process and it is about time other media outlets follow. https://www.facebook.com/community/whats-new/new-tools-features-nurture-community/	the removal of comment spaces is not good for the well being of humans because other people share ideas using the comment space and other comments can make certain people happy.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__noRel	lowers the risk of hate speech being needed	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	Hate speech is already defined in law in many countries. As its already a criminal offence , the existing legislation provides the definition of hate speech, and blueprint to follow.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	people should have values and respect for others.Just like facebook written words are monitored and people already know these rules.A set of rules should be set
__label__noRel	In addition to using algorithms, technology can be used to eliminate comments that involve hate speech for reader inclusivity. I definitely agree to this. Everyone has a freedom of speech, but it should infringe the rights of others too.	I think that the idea of users submitting personal data before making a comment can have positive and negative effects - positive in the sense that the user may think twice before posting hate speech and that they can be tracked down and educated; negative in the sense that the user could be on a website that wants to use user's personal data for the wrong reasons. I am still of the view that comments with hate speech need to be filtered out because each individual needs to be responsible in their speech.
__label__noRel	Training is essential for the Moderators. Moderator will support monitoring.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people.

__label__noRel	I agree	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	This would work well with non-bias moderators	An article proving AI can be helpful, but can struggle to interpret or detect certain things, suggesting manual reviewing is still very important. https://www.latrobe.edu.au/nest/can-combat-rise-online-hate-speech/ On another note, I also think anonymity plays a huge role in what people allow themselves to post online and think that certain platforms should consider only allowing people to comment under their own identity rather than online handles and such.
__label__noRel	Perhaps if there was some form of verification to reduce the hate speeches rather than eliminate free speech completely	allow people to say what they feel
__label__noRel	The only problem is that facts and hate can sometimes be intertwined together and a system cannot always distinguish it easily	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	There absolutely are ways to facilitate healthy conversation and debates without allowing hate speech. Both algorithms and human moderation are ways to ensure debate can continue without resorting to abuse.
__label__noRel	who decides how the moderators moderate? This is too much power	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	censoring/controlling speech in any way is a power that can be used to push a narrative, even with the best intentions in mind. The only way to have free and open debate is to not censor comments or ideas	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	I agree with this as it reflects my own view. Moderation is the way to go and not removal	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	We need rules and governance as a society. We don't always have to say what we think especially when it constitutes hate speech. You can argue respectfully.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	Simultaneously limits freedom of opinion. A censored comment section can hinder thought-provoking discussions	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/19/npr-comments-decision-guardian-readers
__label__noRel	I think it is important for newspapers to provide a platform for people to express and discuss their opinions. Being able to hear other peoples' opinions is an important part of educating oneself, so completely eliminating a comment section seems unprogressive.	I definately think the way forward is to have moderators that will review all comments before they get posted.They can then approve or disapprove all the comments and flag inappropiate user names. Yiou could also add a way for the readers to flag inappropiate comments and these will also flag to the moderators.
__label__noRel	A different perspective	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	monitor the comments that are posted
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	I agree slightly, it is good to see what others think unfiltered.	Limiting the algorithms push to only show negative or controversial viewpoints would go a long way to decreasing the hate comments.
__label__noRel	I think this is a bad idea. The comments section is an important means of debunking biased articles or potentially gaining a different perspective on what others think about what you've just read.	To ensure freedom of speech is still maintained, moderation needs to be carried out fairly. To achieve this, we need to understand what is hate speech and what are the lines that seperate that with constructive criticism. Attached is an article by the Standford encyclopedia of physiosphy regarding hate speech. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hate-speech/
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	I'm not sure if it will work but they can put a sign on the website that says no to hate comments allowed. Or a report button can also help then administrator can review the reported comments

__label__noRel	Its not fair, I believe its best to leave comment bar available to everyone because freedom of speech is still and thing and some who practice hate speech might be educated by another. Instead of leting one person practice hate speech elsewhere its best discussed and dealt with there and then. Something hate speech happenes dure to lack of knowledge.	Make readers agree to not sharing hate speech and let them know that if they do, they will be blocked from commenting.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	Hate speech is not a criticsm and should be avoided
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	I think that only people who provided identifying information can post their opinions. Also I agree that there should be AL tools to prevent hate speech. Eliminating hate speech from newspaper websites has nothing to do with the infringement of the free speech right.
__label__noRel	posting hate is not freedom of speech	There is a fine line between freedom of speech and hate. And hate can be interpreted differently for different people causing biased censorship. Therefore newspapers should have moderators from both sides of opinion that overlook comments to approve before they are published
__label__noRel	I absolutely agree, everyone should be able to express how they feel however shouldn't do so at the expense of others.	I think it is important for people to be able to comment on newspapers websites, but I think there needs to be a way of moderating the comments section to prevent/remove hate speech.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	i believe comment are important, to allow people to discuss. sometimes you can get factual information from other people comments
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	Hate speech should be flagged, hidden and the user should be given a strike. People should be able to still view those comments with a "trigger warning" disclaimer. After 3 strikes the user should be banned from commenting. But they should still be able to view the newspaper so that they don't miss an article that probably would have helped that particular person to change their behavior . More safe and reliable ways of verifying accounts should also be implemented.
__label__noRel	According to a recent survey by Morningconsult, 80% of people want to see all forms of hate speech removed. https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/social-media-firms-moderate-content/	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	I believe some sort of regulation in media will always be necessary to decrease the damage hate speech might cause -- comments space included. We still need to get to the bottom of the issue, though.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	AI could be used to flag hate speech, meaning comments that are hate speech can be flagged at the time. The tech needs more work though based on this article: https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/04/1025742/ai-hate-speech-moderation/
__label__noRel	I don't think removing the comment spaceis a good idea, people should still be given a platform where they can voice themselves out. Having a team look through the comments and find those that include hate speach and remove them and maybe ban the people whith hatespeach comments from ever posting comments again.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	People should be entitled to share opinions.	news media can look into AI technology to solve such problems.the machine will detect faul speeach and instantly hide or delete the comment ,then send a warning to the post writer
__label__noRel	Yes, I totally agree with this. Actually, I think this might be the solution to this problem. If comments are moderated before they go public then there is no chance that offensive and inappropriate comments will make it to the public comments section.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	Removing the comment section from online newspapers is not the answer. Allowing people to post their opinions is healthy and a normal part of human society- people will not always agree. However, in order to reduce hate speech, which can so often lead to crime, it could be done so that there are monitors (either human or computer) who check comments before they are posted to ensure they are not hate speech.
__label__noRel	would move the issue somewhere else	to reduce hate speech it is important to raise the stakes of what happens if you are caught. scientific evidence and criminological theory shows that if someone perceives greater risk in their actions, they are more likely to desist.
__label__noRel	Thats why its best to have set rules. Like swear language, certain words, threats and stuff like that but anything that is just opinion should be allowed no matter if you disagree or don't like what is said.	I agree that free speech should be honoured and upheld. That being said, newspapers are their own entities that should have autonomy over their interactions and comments from readers. Therefore, I think the use of moderators, filtering out certain offensive language, and strict and visible posting guidelines are good ways to reduce hate speech on these websites.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	Moderating is good and maybe informing the person why their message was moderated so that they know and do better next time
__label__noRel	Whilst I agree that the platforms should be responsible, with the vast numbers of people contributing to some platforms it is virtually impossible to moderate every single comment.	By the whole nature of the newspapers removing this ability, who is to say the newspaper itself could be potentially spreading hate news?
__label__noRel	I agree, that feels like a reasonable approach. Although I'm a little bit skeptical what comes to its effectivity.	More emphasis on moderation of specific language would reduce the risk of hate speech. Also, moderators approving comments before they appear on the website would help.
__label__noRel	People bypass these filters in a large number of ways that are hard to stay ahead of. A simple method for example is replacing an E with a 3 in a word so egg becomes 3gg. It is still pretty clear what is being said and bybasses the system that says I can not use that word for example.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	just a maybe if kids are taught to be nice online or in comments from a tender age.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Before an opinion is published it must be moderated and if it contains hate speech then the writer will not be able to post it.
__label__noRel	If we need other peoples opinions before we can form our own then we are literally just looking for confirmation bias of what we already believe	Most people tend to respond aggressively when they know that they are anonymous because they think that they cannot be held accountable for their actions (https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-24373-001)
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	This would reduce the risk of hate speech.	It must me a government's responsibility to implement policies against hate speech.https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-to-combat-fake-news-and-disinformation/
__label__noRel	I agree	There should be serious repercussions against hate speech
__label__noRel	Racists can no longer hide behind anonymity.	I agree with FransescoT online forums can be a wonderful community but hate speech with faceless people can ruin it. If you want to comment there should be some accountability.
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed.

If the community isolates the perpetrators by flagging negative content that would be helpful. Flagged content would then need to be followed by banning perpetrators

I think this is a task that is hard to do because it has to be done in a way that would not hinder freedom of speech but at the same time not attack people. Thus, I think comments should be flagged depending on the words used but not be deleted until it has been checked.
__label__noRel	Agreed, this article shares the same views. Its should not be the Newspaper taking accountability	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	A system should be developed to detect certain words that are considered as hate speech. This will help prevent or eliminate hate speech comments
__label__noRel	I agree with the statement, however in this article https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea they speak about different countries laws and UN laws. The difficulties in combatting hate speech on such a universal level is there is not a solid agreement from the world on what constitutes hate speech and how to combat it.	The technical team of the newspaper should select comments that don't promote hate speech and make those comments the only ones that are going to appear on the newspaper's websites.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	Some of the comment section of some newspaper articles are not worth reading and may sometimes spoil the reading experience. https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed.

__label__noRel	You are right -People have lost the ability to debate, and think that shouting the loudest wins the argument.	I think an AI that could identify some keyword related with hate speech would be helpful to flag that comment and allow further review
__label__noRel	Sadly I must agree. Ongoing monitoring of comments would take too much effort and time. It is simpler to just remove the comments and let the newspaper articles stand for themselves. Pople can always link the article to their own twitter post and comment there if they feel the need to add their own thoughts.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	what is considered non-beneficial to a discussion. (there becomes an issue with bias and matter of opinion)	It may be a good idea to involve some form of moderators to check if there are any hate speeches. Aggressive comments may be censored accordingly. However, we need to be careful in doing this as some may have negative effect as silencing voices.
__label__noRel	the mods could be outweighed due to the content volume	as long as good moderators are in place, hate speech and disrespectful comments will be weeded out.
__label__noRel	@LawrenceM and @AndrewA said it best. This world is already in utter chaos. Humanity? Is that even a thing anymore. Lets's not add further to a world which is breeding hate, discrimination, selfish propoganda, etc on a daily basis. And for the love of all things good, let's use our limited time and energy on this earth to promote tolerance, acceptance and understanding when dealing with matters or situations that we find uncommon or "alien"to us.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Is this a legally binding contract?	The editor must appoint a diverse panel, meaning from different backgrounds to screen comments
__label__noRel	It's up to the reader to consider what is true and what is untrue. I think newspapers could do more to provide guidance on how to evaluate the reliability of sources.	By ticking a box to agree not to be abusive or hateful before being allowed to comment
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	lts true hate speech should be taken as positive criticism
__label__noRel	But have you considered which one has more serious effects and consequences? I think that should be guiding in the main argument on whether to allow commenting or allow hate speech	A reporting site that is accessible across all platforms would be a good start like https://www.report-it.org.uk/reporting_internet_hate_crime.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	user logins can allow for better regulation of comments
__label__noRel	I think that would be a good thing as there isn't really a way to predict how someone will react to specific words or general ideas used against them	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.

__label__noRel	That's a very good point and thanks for pointing out what it's called. I learned something new today! I have seen countless times in anti (fill in blank) groups that use asterisks and other characters to write out otherwise blocked words. They get around the system.	This is not a black or white topic. The question is how exactly we define hate speech. Criticism in itself is not hate speech, but it is easy to take things to extremes, especially when someone expresses their opinion anonymously. Education about the reasons is important to better understand our own feelings and behaviour. Educate people do not restrict them!
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Large companies need to invest more money in having paiI td moderators to monitor hate speech on their articles. I think all speech excpet for speech inciting people to commit violence or murder should be allowed even if i so not agree with it. I think that to prevent hate sppech it will start with educating young people
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	I am not sure collecting data about the person before posting will help with tracing them down and trying to re-educate them. Just blocking the post and providing a response to them saying their post is not accepted by the platform is more appropriate.	by checking what people comment befor approval
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	https://time.com/5739688/facebook-hate-speech-languages/ This is especially true because not all people speak the language! An algorithm would be best, but there are still some technical issues that we need to address.	The comments could be checked for hateful speech. For example, there could be a bot or something (I do not know the exact name) that checks for any hateful words and eliminate that comment.
__label__noRel	it is a thin line to censorship	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	Reduced number of readers because of the cost of purchase.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	I don't think any attempts should be made to block or censor anything. Yes I,m Gen X, yes I gre up with the old adage "sticks and stones make break my bones but words will never touch me" . It aint true, but its a good way to live your life.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	Ideally comment section should not be available on newspaper to reduce hate speech
__label__noRel	The problem is establishing standards can be quite subjective and cause users to complain about censorship...	I agree with your ideas. I think it still gives people a voice but without going too far
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	Having read all of the previous discussion surrounding this debate, I still stand by my original opinion. Moderating comments by an official representative of the newspaper doesn't allow for free speech. We do however, need to eliminate hate speech. I think the best way to do this is to put this in the hands of the community and other readers.
__label__noRel	Reductions in violations	I think people should be encouraged to give personal comments however they need to be monitored to ensure hate speech cannot be seen which might negatively impact others
__label__noRel	giving away personal/sensitive information	The pros of removing comment sections would be to eradicate the spreadof hate speech. Certain individuals thrive on adding fuel to fire. In this case having the comment section deleted would be a positive thing. On the other hand only by having differing opinions can discussions and debates happen. So if someone spews hate speech only then can we see the extent to which someone disagrees with a certain group/viewpoint etc. https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	It goes further than this. We live in a society that has a lot of cry babies. We need to be impervious to negative comments from strangers on a social platform and that is anonymous. Most people need to grow a pair, develop a spine or stop being cry babies. Once this is achieved you will see that any contribution you make to a discussion will be debated in a civilized manner.
__label__noRel	I agree in principle to the idea of moderators, but in practice this can be a pretty blunt tool and quite labour intensive.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	Alternatively I'd offer the opinion that goes against the question and states that we shouldn't offer a space for readers comments (and thus hate speech) at all on news since it's primarily a site and source for news. Systems like https://ground.news/ have been providing news and removing bias without a social aspect already and since third party social/sharing/commentary sites handle discussion and the problem of hate speech far better than newspaper websites presumably can hope to, the solution seems intuitive: remove it and let that happen organically on other websites and platforms.
__label__noRel	I agree that many people have different platforms to air their opinions these days, in fact it is very easy to create fake identities, and posts.	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	educate young people on online politeness for want of a better word word have meaning and consequences in the real world and individuals have to take responsibility and not hide behind keyboards
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	exclude certain words from being posted
__label__noRel	IT is absoluety the websites job to police polirising comments if nesccearry to keep peace wihthin the outiside community viewing their newspapers.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech.

__label__noRel	The united states supreme court has upheld the right to anonymity: McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/514/334/ "Anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority"	I tend to agree that newspapers should provide spaces for dicussion. It encourages people to read about the topic before making comments and peopel can easily reference reference the article in their comments. I think this allows for a more fruitful and productive discussion that on other platforms e.g. social media. However, hate speech is certainly an issue and easily derails conversations. While moderation of hate speech would be ideal, the burden on the newspaper is likely too great to do this manually. Perhaps a mixture of auto-moderation (flagging/removing key words), manual review by the newspaper and some form of community moderation may work well together.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Totally agree . Users all human beings after all
__label__noRel	This will enable people to discuss freely	I don't think newspapers, who have already seen their takings plummet in recent years due to everything moving online, will want to pay to employ moderators for their articles. They would need to have a pretty high number of mods in order to keep up as each newspaper carries so many articles. This topic is a massive minefield and I don't think there is a simple solution to it.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Not possible to to it completely, hate spech can be quite subtle.

__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	I am reminded while discussing this of the way Daily Mail in UK handles the comments section. It just mentions on top of the comments page that theses comments are not moderated.So it allows everybody to express their opionion. This is how it should be done in my opinion
__label__noRel	Some newspapers already don't have comment sections on certain articles which they think would attract harmful comments or trolls.	I have found that as well as reading the articles from newspapers, I have also been paying keen attention to the comments section of the article. Either on the newspaper site or on social media. I find that while the opinions of the article presens the views and research of the author, the comments offer an alternative viewpoint and opinions. A chance to see if the article hit the right note, and an opportunity to understand positives and negatives of a topic raised.
__label__noRel	I agree and I think because there are so many people with so many different opinions, it should be censored before it is either posted or passed through the section.	By flagging certain vocabulary which relates to hate speech and once this is flogged, the person commenting is blocked from posting their view. We would need to look at ways of getting around mispellings of the words though, as people could use this to get past the AI.
__label__noRel	it would be a less divisive place	No-one should have to spend their time filtering out the disgusting things human beings are capable of saying about each other. Nobody has a right to comment on anything.

__label__noRel	Aren't we surveilled enough as it is?	human rights of the masses should not be violated regardless of their beliefs and views
__label__noRel	I think this is very important. Hate speech will drive away advertisers as they will not want to be associated with hateful comments. Newspapers will have to stop those comments to retain revenue.

__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	This project takes the approach of counterspeech, whereby hateful comments are not removed, but instead responded to with alternative, police and non-aggressive comments. https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/counterspeech-better-way-tackling-online-hate
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	Comment sections need to be well-moderated, and if algoritmic or user comment flagging is used this needs to also be reviewed by a human moderator to ensure that there is no bias or bad faith reporting going on.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used...

__label__noRel	Banning hate speech will radicalize people who will only feel more oppressed by the opposition trying to silence them.	Comments could be checked for hate speech before going live.
__label__noRel	The creation of specific platforms to discuss this information often leads to groups with similar beliefs setting up their own platforms, which become a haven for hate speech and fake news	Removing the comment section should not be an option, we should not lose the right to freedom of speech based on the likelihood that a few may post hateful comments, strict moderation and being able to report hate speech is the solution. Having people sign up for platforms and use ID to which they could be held personally accountable is an option as well. Hate Speech often comes from being able to hide behind a keyboard, screen and a fake username.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	Where is the evidence for this? There is no guarantee that people will give correct credentials. Also, who defines 'hate speech'? This is not as simple as you may believe.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed.

__label__noRel	collapsing the comment section is not the solution because people have freedom of speech however those who make hateful comments can be flagged or banned from using the site	There should be moderation reviewers to delete harmful comments

__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	The best way to reduce hate speech would be to make sure that moderators are present to check on comments, it would not be advisable to cancel comments completely due the feedback it gives and people will always have their opinions and sometimes they will involve hate speech, which is unavoidable...

__label__noRel	Yes, any form of hate speech should never be tolerated.	Before an opinion is published it must be moderated and if it contains hate speech then the writer will not be able to post it.

It is a tricky one to get the balance correct. There will always be some people in society who are happy to spout nonsense/hatred online as they sit behind a keyboard. At the same time, there will also be people who wish to share their more sensible and respectful views on topics.
__label__noRel	this would be a good start, i think that having a moderator would help to eliminate hate speech	Hate speech can be controlled by blacklisting keywords on the search engine of a particular blog post/newspapers which will delete any comments that may contain any of the blacklisted keywords.

__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	Every person should be traceable, so they are accountable. If your comments consist of hate speech or are offensive then you be accounable.
__label__noRel	I think that would be good	I think it is important for people to be able to comment on newspapers websites, but I think there needs to be a way of moderating the comments section to prevent/remove hate speech.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Increasing the monitoring of comments made on a post will prevent the propagation of dangerous viewpoints and scams performed on people as no control over the content published create spaces for this to take place.

__label__noRel	maybe get something to control what comes in and goes out	There should be repercussions to extensive hate speech e.g a limited ban to the forum etc. Use moderators and ensure that users understand the consequences of hate speech commente

__label__noRel	Freedom of speech should be always encouraged	hate speech online will always be there and we shouldn't focus on hate speech a lo because there will be a lot of positive comments
__label__noRel	I really liked the identity verification requirement	It seems like many users think that having your personally details posted along with your comment would be a deterrent for people to comment hate speech
__label__noRel	Persons can become very insensitive and offensive in the opinions given, especially in the unmoderated comments forums.	Control what is printed or posted to make sure that it is diverse and does not contain any hate speech but the message they are trying to get across they are able to. That way newspaper can leave the comment section and different opinions are heard and expressed and no one gets hurt.
__label__noRel	yes this absolutly true, newspapers should not be acting like the censorship police	Addressing hate speech does not mean limiting or prohibiting freedom of speech. It means keeping hate speech from escalating into something more dangerous, particularly incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence, which is prohibited under international law. https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	Only People from certain age should be allowed to comment
__label__noRel	I think this already happens on some sites (flagging offensive comments) and is a good way of ensuring any comments which may offend someone, can be moderated and removed if necessary.	The website must have words that are automatically marked as unacceptable. whenever those words are included in a comment, the website must privately warn the sender and not allow the comment to go through until the comment is rephrased correctly and politely.
__label__noRel	Care must be taken not to accidentally block users	There should be some level of censoring to eliminate hate speech, but not to the extent where comments are totally disabled
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	As I saw some commentary on this platform, my opinion is that we need 2 things. A submission of personal data before one can have access to post anything related and real time moderation of the comments. Big platforms like YouTube, Instagram and others are held accountable for their users' actions and they have had a lot of success so far.

__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	The use of admins and moderators can be helpful in removing hate speech. They would need strict rules for the public in order to not let their own personal biases judge what is and isn't considered hate speech.
__label__noRel	That said, I'd agree that everyone should be able to express their opinions.....as long as they are public and the accounts are transparent, without the users hiding behind anonymous accounts. If they do that, then consequences can occur.	By blocking comments with offensive words related to the topic, and banning individuals who constantly engage in hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree	My final argument is that it is possible to monitor and reduce hate speech on website comments by using both AI and human intelligence
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	What about allowing the comment section, but having a built-in screener running in the background, that automatically prevents posts with certain hateful words it is built to detect?
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	Issues around hate speech bring into clear relief the emergence of private spaces for expression that serve a public function, this may lead to violence or non-radical behaviors for the public at large. The only possible way of reduction is for writers to not write or give out any opinions of hate speech. This will ensure that readers are comfortable.
__label__noRel	It is politically incorrect to defy people their freedom of speech.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	I have already said that people who have already displayed hate speech on a website should be banned from giving their opinion.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	I think filtering hate speech comments can do that and allowing a better more positive and a welcome experience to all readers.
__label__noRel	But humans are humans and some abuse these priveleges by posting what they like without considering the consequences.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	I agree with this argument. It is important to balance the right to freedom of speech against the need to reduce hate speech.	Using tool, that automaticully remove discussions where is wrong kind words
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	I feel newspapers don't work well and an interactive medium anyway. "letters to the editor" might be an avenue	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	There needs to be some form of restriction on the content of speech, can you imagine if everyone was given free reigh?	I think certain people should be not allowed to share their opinions publicly because their only intention is to create hate and to upset people. Separately, society need to be educated on how to communicate via Social Media.
__label__noRel	have profiles that are always flagged totally blocked	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	Some people could cloud hate speech as 'open mindedness' and use it as a way to push their agenda without taking responsibility.	I definately think the way forward is to have moderators that will review all comments before they get posted.They can then approve or disapprove all the comments and flag inappropiate user names. Yiou could also add a way for the readers to flag inappropiate comments and these will also flag to the moderators.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	Charactertisation of hate speech should be done case-by-case, rather than applied universally
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	Even though I am generally curious to read other people's comments, I think the best would actually be to eliminate comments altogether, or restrict to the way paper news work, i.e. you can write a letter and they might publish it next time.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I agree	Everyone shoould be able to express their own ideas but we could have some kind of protection in words the should not be allowed and also have a way to keep moderators on the website, people could be warned that they are doing something wrong and be explained that there IS NO HATE SPEECH and be offered maybe some way to express herself without hurting or damaging others.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way.

We may not be able to eliminate hatred entirely, but the more steps we can take to educate and support human beings, and speak out against injustice, the better this world will become.

__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	I have found that as well as reading the articles from newspapers, I have also been paying keen attention to the comments section of the article. Either on the newspaper site or on social media. I find that while the opinions of the article presens the views and research of the author, the comments offer an alternative viewpoint and opinions. A chance to see if the article hit the right note, and an opportunity to understand positives and negatives of a topic raised.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	By making people aware that hate speech is not good by creating awareness campaigns against hate specch.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	I believe that people are allowed to express their opinions , that is why we have freedom of speech. However with that right, we are not subjected to hate speech, there are so many ways of expressing yourself without using offensive or hateful words. Considering a newspaper is a public platform, I believe everyone should try to be respective at all times. The comment space must not be removed, it helps to get insights of readers and is very helpful. I think the website should be enhanced in a way that it detects offensive language and doesn't allow the reader to continue if they use such. Also, comments should be monitored before being posted to the public.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	I think that the introduction of moderators to remove any hate speech would be beneficial. Perhaps the introduction of guidelines as to what constitutes permitted negative comments.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Agree, as you can read here > https://accessiblelaw.untdallas.edu/limits-free-speech-social-media	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	Yes, I totally agree with this. Actually, I think this might be the solution to this problem. If comments are moderated before they go public then there is no chance that offensive and inappropriate comments will make it to the public comments section.	A pop-up can be used which reads "if any 'hate speech' comment is discovered, it will be removed from these comments".
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I actually agree. Just have the news present a perspective. Readers can agree or disagree on their own.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	I think this is a good idea, but people have a way of getting around these filters by using different fonts or characters that cannot be read by the filter bots.	Go through and censor out certain words
__label__noRel	Well thought argument. But most people are over 18 years old and are deliberate in spewing hate its unlikely that they will be re-educated if they have chosen to be bad apples	moderating the comments would surely help
__label__noRel	exactly. One of the root causes is poor education and people not knowing any better, as is stated in this post by United nations: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/impact-and-prevention/preventive-role-of-education. on the UN post, it is said that: "The United Nations Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech places specific emphasis on the transformative power of education as a fundamental tool to address the root causes and drivers of hate speech, and to promote peaceful, inclusive and just societies for all" as they have realised how big of an impact education has on reducing hate speech.	Research has shown that hate speech can be effectively controled since freedom of speech is not absolute
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	This is an interesting point - I wonder if some websites already use AI to moderate user comments and posts. I think AI could be trained to recognise hate speech, although it would have to be tested first as it could censor too much.
__label__noRel	The newspaper has the duty of educating and informing the public. One-sided articles should not be allowed as they fail to give a full perspective and may even spread misinformation, if there commenters are not allowed to correct or add a new perspective.	Hate speech can be controlled by blacklisting keywords on the search engine of a particular blog post/newspapers which will delete any comments that may contain any of the blacklisted keywords.
__label__noRel	makes people feel safe and undiscriminated against when going online	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Removing the comment facility in no way infringes free speech. The content providers, newspapers, are at liberty to provide discussion space or not as they see fit. The use of a moderator might be useful but this seems a great investment of time to little effect. There are obviously those who enjoy using comment spaces to express extreme and unthought out opinions as well as to insert hate speech. Perhaps only those who have subscribed to a news source should be allowed to comment.
__label__noRel	I don't think this is appropriate if it is harmful to others.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	Always a question of who guards the guardians	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	There have to a way to remove hate speech before it could reach the comment space, the comment space is important because some people will help to improve the online newspaper
__label__noRel	I agree	there must be a code of conduct which is publicly accessible to write a comment. comment themselves could have button on where any other person could consider the comment to behateful with a points system in place
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	How did you reach that conclusion? Regulation of comment sections has proven to be effective, as long as people are willing to help the platform by reporting these hate speeches so that it is properly dealt with.	I think if all comments go under review for hate speech, that should still allow a chance for hate speech comments to be retracted
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	I agree that moderating the comment section with flagged phrases that automatically send comments for quick moeration would be a good solution.
__label__noRel	Good for open mindedness.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	Newspaper should avoid subscription from people who use hate speech
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	Implementing a software that detects comments including hate speech, like the ones on social networks. Also including a report button for poeple to report hate speech comments
__label__noRel	I agree, because not all comments will be hate speech, some are positive.	Moderating comments could be a viable solution. The use of AI could make it easier given that there could be thousands and thousands of comments, too much for human moderator/s to keep track of.
__label__noRel	I disagree. This limits the freedom of speech of people and for people to be able to give their opinion and potentially challenge the thoughts of the newspaper. I agree that this should be done in a respectful way.	Holding platforms responsible for all content they publish would help
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	by just making the section smaller and have trasparency with dooing so
__label__noRel	The disadvantage of having free speech it causes people to think it is Ok to bully, lie or name call other people and this causes more chaos and leads to more hate which is not the path that most newspaper websites want.	By ticking a box to agree not to be abusive or hateful before being allowed to comment
__label__noRel	I support the filtering of comments instead of removing the comment section. A filtering systems should be put in place	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	i think minimum news coverage should be given to hate speech and it shouuld be very stictley monitered as well
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	100% correct	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	Yes, it is a very difficult balance and trying to find mechanisms that are fair and balanced to control these are basically impossible to find.	Awareness campaigns need to be implemented to teach people about the significance of avoiding hate speech.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	Stop calling it hate speech maybe it is just another opinion
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	news media can look into AI technology to solve such problems.the machine will detect faul speeach and instantly hide or delete the comment ,then send a warning to the post writer
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	can help educate	One way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for reader comments would to have active community managers who are activetly managing the comment section. Making sure that all comments are in accordance to the community guidelines.
__label__noRel	yes we need to be able to express our opinions	It seems this remains a diffcult question, with varying responses on the subject
__label__noRel	Freedom of speech and thought are both really important and allow people to sometimes 'clear' their minds of thoughts.	Debate should be available upon all topics. To reduce this availability reduces the opportunities for people to express their opinions and undermines democratic processes. Hate speech should be managed and eliminated before publication.

The bot will therefore remove the comment andhold it until it has mannually reviewed by a human. Another option can be to allow the users to report comments from other users and if the reports reach a certain threshold then hold that comment for review.
__label__noRel	it would give focus to the journalism.	I think newspapers should not take away the comment section. Firstly this is unfair to all the people who want to have their say and should be able to do so Dominicis wrong
__label__noRel	yes, in this way since it will be able to detect hate speech, and readers will still have a chance to news others options, nor to add their thoughts into the account.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	by checking what people comment befor approval
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	/?Are there ways to better police it and identify key words/phrases? Is there an automated moderator program?
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	I don't want to see the comments space removed as it amounts to censorship. I'd much rather that people saw what other people thought and were able to consider it. Hopefully, readers will recognise when some people are irrational and will not add fuel to the fire. Good moderators would help but they mustn't be trigger happy. They must allow dissent and only remove what it clearly offensive.
__label__noRel	regulation means a safe space	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.

Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	I do not agree with this, to solve this issue, there should be moderators to monitor the comments before they are posted	While freedom of speech is a human right, it is imperative to be cognizant of the fact that each and every person has the right to have their rights respected. It is for this reason that readers comments cannot be removed. Everyone has the right to make a comment and we do not necessarily always have to agree, we always have to respect. A system can be put in place to remove any vulgar language.
__label__noRel	This might overcome some problems, but would be hard to remove subtle or 'disguised' hate speech, if only working on word triggers.	people should have values and respect for others.Just like facebook written words are monitored and people already know these rules.A set of rules should be set

__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	I think you can put a price to the website- a subscription to readers.
__label__noRel	Yeah. That's true anyway. Freedom of speech is good but protecting the citizens and preventing violence through hate speech is also great	I think hate speech is always going to be a problem unfortunately, and although websites can monitor comments and remove any hate speech what ultimately is needed is teaching people there are better ways to get their opinions across and better use of freedom of speech.

__label__noRel	I also agree with this. This solution is a middle ground between two extremes.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	This is true which is why I also suggested introducing a reporting feature so that, in cases where hate speech may not automatically be detected, people would still be able to raise a concern about the comment.	This article made me reflect on the definition of hate speech and I aggree with blocking comments that go against a persons protected characteristics - if a comment like that is made, it should instantly be banned from the platform / comment section. https://about.fb.com/news/2017/06/hard-questions-hate-speech/
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated.

__label__noRel	freedom of speech	In the digital world we live in - unfortunately hate speech is part and parcel of the benefits of having such an open forum and allowing everyone to have a voice.

__label__noRel	I agree	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.

__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	You should be allowed to give your opinion to express your view about a news article. To moderate this or to filter what you can and cannot say would it stop it from being free speech. What really needs to be looked at is to see how you can stop online trolling which I think is the root cause of some of these comment sections become so toxic. But for the media who is so depended on free speech themselves so that they can report on news in an unbiased way to eliminate the comment space is almost hypocritical. Just a weird idea here but perhaps you should do a quick test or verification before you can comment. A lot of people would not go through the effort of completing this if they just want to spread hate.
__label__noRel	Free speech can be restricted.	Have a moderator than overlooks all readers comments and makes sure they're all suitable.
__label__noRel	there is no diversity which might make people not want to read the newspaper	hate speech is inevitable

A lot of individuals hide behind their screens and say things to people that they wouldn't have the guts to say in person given the opportunity. So with that being said I stand for the elimination of the space bar for readers.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	I disagree with the stance of doing away with the comment section in its entirety, it goes against the premise of media which is to spark a debate or discussion.
__label__noRel	But some publishers are indeed deciding to pre-emptively remove comment sections, whether across the entire site or just for specific articles they expect to lead to problematic comment sections - see some of the links within https://digiday.com/media/comments-sections/	Hate speech is a problem but we do need to have debate. We need to respect different views and allow people to voice their opinion where necessary to further a debate on a news topic. Having the comments vetted before they appear does allow for some censorship but that must not be at the cost of open discussion.
__label__noRel	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button	Newspaper comment spaces allow people the opportunity to share their opinions and feel that they can contribute their thoughts and ideas - it can also help readers engage with the content in a different way.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	Newspapers should be a pleasure to read and not make you angry after reading comments not having comments will make them more pleasurable to read again.
__label__noRel	It is the way to go. Hate speech should not be allowed a space in society	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	It is important to allow people to express their view to abide with freedom of speech. However, having the option to view these comment with a warning would allow people to ignore potential hate speech comments but still lets them read it if they want to.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	I think people still have the right to comment on an article and give their opinion. It would be wrong to not permit this.	Despite our general right to freedom of speech, hate speech remains inextricably linked to hate crimes and intolerance. A hard stance should be taken by newspapers against hate speech, utilising moderators to remove hateful comments, despite the fact that it could be construed as a restriction on free speech.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	I think people should be able to express their feelings, but there should be a way to block hate speech
__label__noRel	I agree most with this post, there's no reason to allow hate speech to exist on social platforms when it's so easy to moderate and control	By flagging certain vocabulary which relates to hate speech and once this is flogged, the person commenting is blocked from posting their view. We would need to look at ways of getting around mispellings of the words though, as people could use this to get past the AI.
__label__noRel	I think using AI would not prove to be very effective. If this AI was to be self-supervised (without any moderators) I think it would quickly start flagging not-hateful comments as hate speech since it's very susceptible to user input - see what happened to Microsoft's Twitter bot Tay. After a couple of weeks, if I'm not mistaken, the AI started posting very hateful tweets about the holocaust and minorities.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	i believe that people know what is wrong and what is right. they do know when their comments are harmful	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	Some hate speech is actually illegal, so that should definitely be reported and removed. https://www.report-it.org.uk/reporting_internet_hate_crime

__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	I was completely taken aback by some strong stances to remove the comment space, and the belief in that because Newspapers should be one-sided providers. I would disagree because newspaper share societal information and society should be allowed to engage and be part of the conversation instead of just consuming whatever information is being released for consumption. It has been seen as a result of other newspaper websites removing the comment section that it reduces the trust of the reader because they are aware of the bias of the information they are consuming, and also it reduces the amount of time readers spend on these sites because there is no community engagements.

__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	Recent political positions in the UK have lead to more fighting for 'free speech' and saying that it is ok to be offended - this is shown in a police news release (https://www.college.police.uk/article/protecting-freedom-expression-updated-guidance). I would disagree - offending people is unacceptable.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	I do not think it is possible, in a fair and just way. When speech is restricted that's called censorship. Who would justify the restrictive opinion?
__label__noRel	Prevents fake news	using key words and having moderators might help
__label__noRel	I do think that people just comment on things even if they don't have a strong opinion about it, just because it's easy to. This is why I feel they wouldn't act out in another way if the commenting platforms were taken away, as they inherently don't actually feel passionately about an issue enough to put energy into opposing it.	I think that a comment section is necessary for engagement and exchange of ideas but having said that, there should be a code for AI embedded within that platform which will be able to detect hate speech or words classified as hate speech then the AI can delete them automatically. Also people can report the comment and the AI should delete the comment within minutes of it being reported.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	monitor comments before the are posted
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	You can let people create an account with a full name so they will have to think more about what they write and can't so easily spew hate
__label__noRel	This may work	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	https://eachother.org.uk/would-removing-social-media-anonymity-protect-or-threaten-our-rights/ Perhaps hate comments could be reduced by removing the ability to post comments anonymously?
__label__noRel	IT is absoluety the websites job to police polirising comments if nesccearry to keep peace wihthin the outiside community viewing their newspapers.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	by having it monitored and removing hate speech at source
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	I agree on the usefulness of a report button.	I think that someone should be assigned as a moderator who assesses comments before they are posted to ensure they don't contain any offensive information
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	I agree!	Maybe online newspapers can invest in text mining, where if hate speech is detected, the comment will not go through. Or, in the comments section, there could be a greyed message in the background that states a non-tolerance to hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree	Readers should be able to comment but be informed of certain comments that would be considered hate speech. If they are aware and still choose to comment hateful words, the newspaper website should feel comfortable enough to remove those comments since the reader was informed that comments like those would not be acceptable.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	Yes, algorithms developed alongside the countries law makers and governing bodies could help reduce legally defined hate speech without making room for petty vendetas or the silencing of free speech.	There will always be a few bad apples in a batch just as there will always be bad people among humanity. Honestly the easiest method of combatting this issue is through the utilization of manual review teams perhaps hired by the newspaper or even paid through revenue made by the articles failing that approach bots can be instantiated with the programmed capability of removing comments that have flagged contents inside them.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	But what about those who were going to give positive comments. I believe comments should just be monitored
__label__noRel	it allows disagreement while preventing abuse	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.

__label__noRel	Good. As long as it wasn't reported and the opinion was well written.	ADD A HATE SPEECH DETECTOR
__label__noRel	I think this already happens on some sites (flagging offensive comments) and is a good way of ensuring any comments which may offend someone, can be moderated and removed if necessary.	Just don't write about it
__label__noRel	I really liked the identity verification requirement	I agree that the only way to ensure balanced discussion without allowing hate or eliminating genuine responses is through moderation of comments before posting
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I don't think the best education policy will combat trolls, bad faith actors or targeted/well orchestrated hate campaigns.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Exactly	The power of newspapers is too strong and needs to be restricted , moderation of the comments section is needed linked with non anonymous posting of mcomments
__label__noRel	there is always a need for opinions	The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is often used as a reason not to have readers comments. It seems that this is not a fair argument for eliminating readers comments because of the psychological phenomenon of "cognitive dissonance" - we automatically search for echo chambers in any context.
__label__noRel	I don't believe that anybody who had the capacity to give rise to fake news can do something more powerful than commenting, and I think that filters being put into place would be more productive than completely eliminating to option to comment - this phenomenon will always exist and can easily take place on other platforms regardless	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	readers comments be moderated and anything that is harmful, hateful or hurtful should be removed. this allows people to exercise their right of freedom of speech but limiting the harm that someones opinion may have
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	by blocking users who violate 'hate speech rules', i feel it should be clearly stated what hate speech is.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	The root cause of most issues is likely from a select few, root out the troublemakers and ban accordingly.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	comment sections are necessary so we can see different opinions on one topic
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Through active moderation.
__label__noRel	That's a very good point and thanks for pointing out what it's called. I learned something new today! I have seen countless times in anti (fill in blank) groups that use asterisks and other characters to write out otherwise blocked words. They get around the system.	Firstly, newspapers need to enact a proper system of moderation. Blocking all comments infringes on free speech and does not allow readers to provide a counterpoint to the position provided in the article.
__label__noRel	Sometimes people do need to be censored, especially when it comes to hate speech because sometimes those words become actions and people get assaulted in real life. Words spoken online sometimes rally people together to take action (for example what happened in the United States when people stormed the Capitol because of fake news spreading online about the voting results being fraudulent https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/06/election-misinformation-helped-fuel-jan-6-capitol-attack-now-climate-misinformation-threatens-planet/ )	I think we could have a hold on comments until it is checked and fact checked by a panel of people! Not just one person making the decision. Also I think if there were stricter punishments for hate speech the newspaper would make the person and newspaper think twice.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	the things is they might create fake accounts or have bots commenting on their behalf.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	Sometimes newspapers are very skewed and/or publish incorrect information. This approach would make it harder for people to question facts and stats/the content provided.	Disabling comments reduces free speech and makes everything monitored and authorised - then you have to question who is controlling what we see?
__label__noRel	In the same way that society needs to fight hate, the Internet needs to fight online hate.	The use of admins and moderators can be helpful in removing hate speech. They would need strict rules for the public in order to not let their own personal biases judge what is and isn't considered hate speech.
__label__noRel	is achievable	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	this article : https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/830/3/032006 indicates that the algorithm that is considered to be the best for removing hate speech is still only just over 71% effective. This still leaves a lot of room for error.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	Holding platforms responsible for all content they publish would help
__label__noRel	This is one of the most sane posts in this discussion. Thank you.	Should be reviewed first before it gets published
__label__noRel	yes indeed we have to check the root cause analysis	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	I don't think any attempts should be made to block or censor anything. Yes I,m Gen X, yes I gre up with the old adage "sticks and stones make break my bones but words will never touch me" . It aint true, but its a good way to live your life.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	After doing some follow up reading from https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/what-is-online-hate-crime/ I have seen how the anonymity of these online comments can be what makes it so easy for people to be hateful. Therefore, an easy solution would be to make it impossible for people to comment anonymously, and have people have to provide personal information. However, I am not sure how this would work from a data protection point of view. It is certainly a start.
__label__noRel	I absolutely agree with this. As we've seen recently (https://medium.com/dfrlab/alt-right-and-alt-social-media-4fa23eb2fbd1) cracking down on the more ofensive comments on one website can lead to groups of people finding a more lenient place and bunching up there, creating a vicious cycle where they push each other to be more and more extreme. It's true that we should monitor the comment section, but overdoing it could lead to worse results somewhere else.	Having moderators remove hateful speech and providing better education.

__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?

__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Offers good ways to combat hate speech on newspaper websites.	There needs to be rules and regulations stating the type of comments that can be made about other people. There should also be verification of a persons identity everytime they make a comment so that is visible who the statement was made by. Newspaper articles should constantly ready and delete hate speech comment.
__label__noRel	A way to deal with this could be starting laws against hate speech or have punishments in place.	i agree that people have the right to express their own ideas but you have to be considerate otherwise it can easily be interpreted as hate if your not careful with wordings.
__label__noRel	Because some peoples opinions can be hurtful to others	Research has shown that hate speech can be effectively controled since freedom of speech is not absolute
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	One way I propose to prevent hate speech is to remove anonymity online. Not being able to hide should limit cowardly behavior and thus reduce harmful speech.

__label__noRel	everyone should be entitled to free speech	I am unsure if there is a way to reduce hate speech. One persons 'hate speech' is anothers 'freedom of speech'.

Newspaper websites should use human or artificial intelligence-based moderators who can impartially identify hate speech and remove it from their platforms without removing or censoring genuine, constructive comments and perspectives. If AI is used, certain terms and phrases can be added to a database and comments containing them flagged for moderation to remove hate speech fairly.

__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	I think newspapers websites should have an online system that can detect hate speech and block users that use this kind of language but keeping it open for negative or positive feedback would be fair but not giving readers the freedom to use hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used...

__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	I think hate speech is always going to be a problem unfortunately, and although websites can monitor comments and remove any hate speech what ultimately is needed is teaching people there are better ways to get their opinions across and better use of freedom of speech.

__label__noRel	I agree as many news papers in our days don't have comment sections as it is expensive and time consuming	Freedom of speech can be used as catch-all term to justify the use and propagation of bigoted and hateful language. If we accept that some language is not acceptable due to it's clearly hateful nature then we have to acknowledge that some form of censorship of those particular instances has to occur. I would suggest that eliminating all such spaces from newspaper websites would have a massive detrimental effect on valid, non-bigoted, freedom of speech a cornerstone of western life. We don't ban all cars because some people speed dangerously, we monitor the roads and ban the bad drivers. I suggest that as long as readers comments are monitored continually they should remain.
__label__noRel	I think this is a good idea, but people have a way of getting around these filters by using different fonts or characters that cannot be read by the filter bots.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	Training AI to do that would be a great way to prevent this phenomen	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

__label__noRel	Agree, it is essential to monitor hate	reducing hate speech on the newspaper websites is possible without taking the drastic measures of completely cancelling the comment section one way of doing that there should be moderators who approve the comment before they are published on the website.

While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I totaly agree, it will help to screen the comments in a way to avoid such incidences where people say things that can be hateful to another person. With the help of the technology i do belive this can be achieved in future to avoid being violated.	A possible way to address hate speech on newspaper sites would be to incorporate both human moderators and some sort of AI that monitors for hateful words and comments. The requirement to submit personally identifying information before commenting might also help because without this then anyone can create a fake name that hides the person's true identity so therefore more likely to engage in hate speech. If personal information is required, then hate speech would be less likely.
__label__noRel	People are entitled to an opinion that isn't hateful or intended to harm a person.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	I agree with this! It would reduce hate speech.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	Freedom of speech can be used as catch-all term to justify the use and propagation of bigoted and hateful language. If we accept that some language is not acceptable due to it's clearly hateful nature then we have to acknowledge that some form of censorship of those particular instances has to occur. I would suggest that eliminating all such spaces from newspaper websites would have a massive detrimental effect on valid, non-bigoted, freedom of speech a cornerstone of western life. We don't ban all cars because some people speed dangerously, we monitor the roads and ban the bad drivers. I suggest that as long as readers comments are monitored continually they should remain.
__label__noRel	You can't censor everybody because of the behaviour of the few. Better to deal with the keyboard warriors individually	I tend to agree that newspapers should provide spaces for dicussion. It encourages people to read about the topic before making comments and peopel can easily reference reference the article in their comments. I think this allows for a more fruitful and productive discussion that on other platforms e.g. social media. However, hate speech is certainly an issue and easily derails conversations. While moderation of hate speech would be ideal, the burden on the newspaper is likely too great to do this manually. Perhaps a mixture of auto-moderation (flagging/removing key words), manual review by the newspaper and some form of community moderation may work well together.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.

__label__noRel	Yes, the most easy way to make sure that people don't spread hate speech any further would be to educate people on the steps that should be done before posting any of your opinions. https://www.thecommentingclub.co.uk/sharing-your-opinion/	I think there should a program that verify the comment before they are displayed on the newpaper

__label__noRel	The issue at hand is not the total elimination of hate speech, but whether it can be reduced on newspaper websites.

It is important to censor comments, freedom of speech does not always equate to disrespecting the views and opinions of others. While I agree that comments should be censored, I do not agree that every comment should be removed. As mentioned before, a system can be implemented that removes comments with certain words, thus making the comment section a safe space for all who use it.
__label__noRel	It may prevent recruitment to these groups of people who may hold similar views or brainwashed into accepting false theories	One way I propose to prevent hate speech is to remove anonymity online. Not being able to hide should limit cowardly behavior and thus reduce harmful speech.

Blocking words does not stop hate, what we need to do is have a filter that alerts a human so that a post.

__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	I agree with the notion that being able to share our thoughts and feelings is a right and having people share their views can help people to question their own thoughts.

__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	We can reduce hate speech by holding the owner of the platform accountable for hate speech being on their platform, this will force the platform owners to put strict systems in place to ensure this does not occur.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	Moderating comments sections is a lot of work to do manually, the individuals tasked with it would burn out in short time trying to manage that effectively while also having to read hateful garbage all day. If there was a system to remove hate speech it needs to be automated with an algorithm that catches certain words, then reviewed manually when someone disagrees with the content removed and it not being against guidelines. We use guidelines for everything including media regulations for accurate reporting or having to retract when information is not accurate. It's no different in the comments section, it doesn't remove free speech it regulates it to create a healthy environment to have a conversation in. Over moderation can have as severe of an effect as under, it has to be a system that takes in common complaints from both sides. Not the hate speech side per say but the sides of people who are pro free flowing conversation and those who want more shielding to avoid extremist echo chambers.

__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	This article made me reflect on the definition of hate speech and I aggree with blocking comments that go against a persons protected characteristics - if a comment like that is made, it should instantly be banned from the platform / comment section. https://about.fb.com/news/2017/06/hard-questions-hate-speech/

__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	Comment space encourages discussion of important topics and allows free exchange of information and so should not be eliminated. Independent moderators should be used in order to ensure that hate speech is quickly deleted and encourage users to express their ideas without using inappropriate or aggressive language.
__label__noRel	I agree, and I think it's best to ban some words that will offend people. I also think the users who are trolls should be banned early on to protect the comment section.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	I think it demonstrates clearly how often AI struggles to detect hate speech or misclassifies innocent content as hateful - it would just further restrict freedom of speech.	Readers that feel the need to put hate speech in comment section only do so because of the way they can remain anonymous online. In everyday life you could go months and if not years without hearing hate speech, whilst it can almost be a daily occurrence when browsing online in various forums, social media platforms or comment sections on news websites. Finding a way for readers/users not to remain anonymous and having real consequences for spreading hate speech would reduce this issue.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	Eliminating the space for comments entirely will mean that each article is viewed through the lens of the journalist.

__label__noRel	Totally agree but the team of moderators might be a high cost for the newspaper, especially if they need to evaluate every comment	I'm a firm believer of freedom of speech therefore eliminating it in any form especially because of something that can be regulated like hate speech, to me is ridiculous.
__label__noRel	There needs to be some form of restriction on the content of speech, can you imagine if everyone was given free reigh?	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	there would be no hate speech	Proper moderation that does not tolerate racist, sexist or any other discriminating behavior or hate speech.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	An article proving AI can be helpful, but can struggle to interpret or detect certain things, suggesting manual reviewing is still very important. https://www.latrobe.edu.au/nest/can-combat-rise-online-hate-speech/ On another note, I also think anonymity plays a huge role in what people allow themselves to post online and think that certain platforms should consider only allowing people to comment under their own identity rather than online handles and such.
__label__noRel	Stops people with genuine none discriminatory opinions to express themselves	Moderation is key. Plenty of newspapers and online media are able to keep comments open with a bit of moderation.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	The newspaper website platform owners should be held accountable for any hate speech that occurs on their website and they can combat hate speech allowing fellow readers to be able to flag/report posts that they deem hateful.The moderators can then investigate.

One user by the name of AndreaP said in order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section Newspapers should be one sided providers. I strongly disagree with this argument.

Either on the newspaper site or on social media. I find that while the opinions of the article presens the views and research of the author, the comments offer an alternative viewpoint and opinions. A chance to see if the article hit the right note, and an opportunity to understand positives and negatives of a topic raised.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech.

__label__noRel	i think they should have a filtering software to remove hate speech words and from being posted on the newspaper websites.	While censoring certain words in the context of a comment would help reduce hate speech, an issue that would need to be considered is the use of images used as hate speech. Some "memes" can contain hate speech to the AI may misinterpret this as a regular image while the image could be posted as hate speech. An example of this is when people on Reddit use images as "memes" containing racism and sometimes the bot does not flag it as racism. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230

An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	I dont agree with this, if hate speech is causing societal issues it should be talk about in the news	I definately think the way forward is to have moderators that will review all comments before they get posted.They can then approve or disapprove all the comments and flag inappropiate user names.

__label__noRel	How can we draw the fine line between hate speech and freedom of speech?	I think that keeping an open space for discussion is vital and needed. Strick and easy to understand rules should be there and a group of moderators implementing them as well. We should do more about educating on media ethics, keeping freedom of expression should be combined with counteracting hate speech messages.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	I think having moderators who check the comments and remove any that contain hate speech is the best way of reducing it.
__label__noRel	comments can be moderated and removed	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	I believe the fairest way is the hardest way and that's to have a small group of people moderating REAL hate speech and spam. If someone wants to just use a racist term or promote their website, then these people's comment should be removed and they should be banned from commenting for a period of time. The idea to remove comments entirely is absurd as the news is not trustworthy enough to be the sole voice people hear. We need to hear other voices.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	We can reduce hate speech by holding the owner of the platform accountable for hate speech being on their platform, this will force the platform owners to put strict systems in place to ensure this does not occur.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	I think that the warning system is a good route, as the AI might eliminate valid arguments and miss hate speech accidentally. A warning system would still need an AI, but it warns users that their comment may be hate speech and if it is, the user can rethink their wording or risk posting it. If they post it, maybe a manual review can happen to determine if it was hate speech or not.
__label__noRel	This is true because it takes the focus away from the real news!	I would disagree richard, newspapers can often fuel hate speech through their phrasing and the way they choose to title their articles therefore it is down to them to avoid hate speech spreading on their websites.
__label__noRel	I agree , however strong moderation to the comments very quickly could work.	The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is often used as a reason not to have readers comments. It seems that this is not a fair argument for eliminating readers comments because of the psychological phenomenon of "cognitive dissonance" - we automatically search for echo chambers in any context.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	It is true, there is freedom of speech, all readers should be able comment on what they think	I see that most people have the same idea as I have of having moderated. I did not think about what the guidelines could be and how censoring could be a contributing factor to my stand on having comments moderated, but it still seems like the best solution.

__label__noRel	I like the idea of 'repeat offenders' being noticed if you will. It means people can't abuse the system as easily	My position as a reader and my argument is that bases on the rules of speech people have freedom of speech and expression. That should be done in a proper way without insulting others or hating or being racist in your speech. Websites and newspapers should not remove the comments of the people responding to hate speech. This is done according to the rules found in the following article: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230

__label__noRel	I absolutely agree, everyone should be able to express how they feel however shouldn't do so at the expense of others.	I don't think removing the comment section reduces hate speech per se, it just pushes it elsewhere. I can't help feeling this sort of censorship is an infringement on free speech.

__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.

__label__noRel	If your opinion degrades or harms an individual it is not needed. Removing it is the best option	The question is? Is hate speech not part of free speech? I think people should be left to express themselves however they feel is appropriate as long as they are not breaking an laws
__label__noRel	Persons will have to think before responding.	Having a comments section can be ideal to engage in a healthy debate but will need to monitored very strictly to ensure there is no bullying or one sided views be taken against any individuals
__label__noRel	It is their responsibility though because if someone feels unsafe on their platform due to hate commentary then they lose customers and in some eyes may endorse hate speech by not doing anything to address it or try and filter it.	The best way to curb hate speech would be to have the comments section moderated for any forms of hate speech. In this manner people who have an opinion with substance can have a say in whatever article that was published.

It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	We can reduce hate speech by holding the owner of the platform accountable for hate speech being on their platform, this will force the platform owners to put strict systems in place to ensure this does not occur.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	We need people to supply their personal details in order to limit hate speech
__label__noRel	That will take too long time to do manually, so it's best to ban some words in the start. If the user is using to many of the banned words, then ban the user automatically.	We can have a system where every comment has to be checked and vetted for hate speech and if it infringes on any of the platform's rules and regulations then the comment is automatically removed.

Having news discussed by people is what sparks change in our society, so they are still important and probably shouldn't be removed!	Have them reviewed after they are posted and do not allow them to be viewed before they are revied, as well as keeping tabs on the user posting the comments.

__label__noRel	I don't believe the comments section should be removed as everyone is entitled to a voice	Ask people to be respectful and back-up their opinions factually. The danger, of course, is attaching URLs or info that themselves propagate misinformation by presenting it as fact.
__label__noRel	This solves one problem - no one can then be offended	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it.

__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	i think by just censoring specific words that are hateful/derogatory this could then automically screen out hateful comments that are abusive - i think it should be judged on what would be an offense to say in person.

Asking people to identify themselves when doing their registration. If we remove the anonymous factor, people will be afraid to act like trolls.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	Having read all of the previous discussion surrounding this debate, I still stand by my original opinion. Moderating comments by an official representative of the newspaper doesn't allow for free speech. We do however, need to eliminate hate speech. I think the best way to do this is to put this in the hands of the community and other readers.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	We can have a system where every comment has to be checked and vetted for hate speech and if it infringes on any of the platform's rules and regulations then the comment is automatically removed.
__label__noRel	I think this is a good idea, but people have a way of getting around these filters by using different fonts or characters that cannot be read by the filter bots.	I agree with some other opinions on the use of A1 to flag or censor certain words that constitute hate or violent speech.

__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	Democracy dies in darkness. Commentary on news was made to spark debate and deeper thought about new events. I feel something is lost if we remove this feature from news articles.	Perhaps newspapers could use similar tools to respondology (https://respondology.com/ ) or hive moderation (https://hivemoderation.com ) that can identify and block hateful speech. This might well work and I think both of these use AI.
__label__noRel	Completely correct, effective moderation is the answer.	Having read through the opinions of others, my stance has not completely changed. It is important to censor comments, freedom of speech does not always equate to disrespecting the views and opinions of others. While I agree that comments should be censored, I do not agree that every comment should be removed. As mentioned before, a system can be implemented that removes comments with certain words, thus making the comment section a safe space for all who use it.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Who deems whether criticism is valid or invalid in this situation? I guess there will always be conflicting opinions and ideas, but over policing of this may not be the solution to managing hate speech.	This article below focuses on the negative views of the comment section. I like the quote from Dr Philips, as she explains that more discussion is required, not less, and thus an onsite intervention is required to deal with hate speech as opposed to the removal of the comment section. https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	I think we firstly have to call out hate speech in order for people to learn that it is not okay and unacceptable. The reason being online 'haters' tend to abuse their right to free speech such that it infringes upon the next person because they have the comfort of knowing that nobody will find put who they really are and confront them. By calling out users on the newspaper website and responding to their comment as the moderator of the comments, and actually suspending their accounts because of it can go a long way.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	I think there should at least be a 'report' button and any hate speech reported should be removed.

__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	We need to create a society where we can debate with each other respectfully, we can know which platforms to use and not rile each other up without offending. It is widely suggested that education can address the extent of hate speech: https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/addressing-hate-speech-through-education-global-education-ministers-conference. However, this needs to go hand in hand with moderation of sites to ensure people are kept within reason. It is not a case of any one single solution.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	It must me a government's responsibility to implement policies against hate speech.https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-to-combat-fake-news-and-disinformation/
__label__noRel	Tracking details could become intrusive.	I strongly feel that comments are an essential part of the readers experience. It assists readers by giving them a broader sense and understanding of the topic being discussed. Removing them would be taking a way an integral part of that experience.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	Our freedom to do anything as part of a society is limited. Thus freedom of speech should be no different. Poeple need to be held accountable for their mistakes, so everybody else's rights will be protected. So having a set of keywords which are not allowed to be used is a way of reminding the writter that using the offensive word he/she is trying to use is considered a crime. An additional way to handle that is having the flag option by users and a team of moderators who follow a standard and will verify if flagged comments should be maintained or not. Lastly, anonymity might bring a feeling of impunity and even its possibility, so a way to avoid that is allowing one profile per person/email, where a fake username can be set, but, in the backstage, the website will know who it is that wrote each comment.
__label__noRel	I agree. Considering much of this hate speech comes from bots it is impossible to keep up with it. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20563051221104749	My position as a reader and my argument is that bases on the rules of speech people have freedom of speech and expression. That should be done in a proper way without insulting others or hating or being racist in your speech. Websites and newspapers should not remove the comments of the people responding to hate speech. This is done according to the rules found in the following article: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	Asking people to identify themselves when doing their registration. If we remove the anonymous factor, people will be afraid to act like trolls.
__label__noRel	Banning hate speech will radicalize people who will only feel more oppressed by the opposition trying to silence them.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender.

__label__noRel	yes, and don't remove all post, just the part that contains what is termed hate speech,	The only way to combat hate speech is through open debate. Restricting any form of speech (even hate speech) could lead to hateful views becoming unchallenged and potentially result in violence. There is also the issue that newspapers could define hate speech as certain comments they don't like destroying any potential for open debate. By maintaining open debate hate speech can be called out and as a result, become less frequent.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	Newspaper websites should use human or artificial intelligence-based moderators who can impartially identify hate speech and remove it from their platforms without removing or censoring genuine, constructive comments and perspectives. If AI is used, certain terms and phrases can be added to a database and comments containing them flagged for moderation to remove hate speech fairly.
__label__noRel	i agree. it is not a permanent solution	I agree with most of the commenters here, there needs to be moderation. Even if you don't agree with the arguments there are ways of saying it that do not fall into 'hate speech'.
__label__noRel	If they give source to backup their views. That is good as you can verify it though the site could be bias.	Recent political positions in the UK have lead to more fighting for 'free speech' and saying that it is ok to be offended - this is shown in a police news release (https://www.college.police.uk/article/protecting-freedom-expression-updated-guidance). I would disagree - offending people is unacceptable.
__label__noRel	Unmoderated online comment forums are magnets for noxious speech. For years they have carried people’s discontent out into the world, while the writers sit safely behind screens. It’s almost bittersweet to think back on the time we once blamed internet flaming on the online disinhibition of middle school pranksters. It is the many unhappy adults in the electorate who are posting the things they are really thinking in comment boxes. Nearly three-quarters of internet users – 73 percent – have witnessed online harassment. News website comment sections host antagonistic conversations between contributors. Nine out of 10 respondents of a Pew Research study said the online environment was more enabling of criticism. The squabbling can be overwhelming: As many as 34 percent of news commenters and 41 percent of news comment readers identified argumentative comments as the reason they avoid reading or joining the discourse. Multiple studies show online communities develop sophisticated norms that guide participants. Anger begets more anger. Unshackled digital vitriol is now volleyed back and forth online from all sides. Some commenters don’t even care if they are anonymous anymore. Researchers have found real-name comments on social media are actually nastier than unsigned commentary. Historically, American democracy always had some rudeness baked into it. For example, during the presidential election of 1800, incumbent President John Adams’ campaign proclaimed “murder, robbery, rape, adultery and incest will all be openly taught and practiced” if his opponent, Thomas Jefferson, won the presidency. Jefferson, meanwhile, described Adams as “a hideous hermaphroditical character,” with “neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman.” Civility in public discourse is often what people in power expect of their citizens. Demands for civility can be used by those with authority to deny power to those with none. People who feel marginalized or alienated use incivility and civil disobedience to fight the power. By causing offense and indignation, as we saw during Campaign 2016, outsiders gained massive attention for their cause. Yet “democracy only functions when its participants abide by certain conventions, certain codes of conduct and a respect for the process,” wrote cultural journalist Neal Gabler in an eloquent essay about how a hateful electorate threatens democracy. Gabler noted that the 2016 presidential campaign was referred to as the “hate election” because everyone professed to hate both candidates. It turned out to be the hate election, Gabler mused, “because of the hatefulness of the electorate.” He went on:https://theconversation.com/how-news-sites-online-comments-helped-build-our-hateful-electorate-70170	By the whole nature of the newspapers removing this ability, who is to say the newspaper itself could be potentially spreading hate news?
__label__noRel	I agree, having it flagged and hidden until review is fair. If the comments section has clear rules then its easy to moderate if a comment broke them or not instead of it being subjective or based on opinion	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	covering both sides is great but we should be able to be respectful towards eachother	We need very close moderation as this in all likelihood is the best way to ensure hate speech does not spread, human interaction is key as algorithms do not do a very good job
__label__noRel	The problem is hate speech really means political speech. It's a way of silencing dissent of political agendas that are transforming certain countries societies in a way people don't like.

There is a fine line between free speech and hate speech. I don't think there is any way to reduce this because people will take the stand and say that their free speech is being taken away from them.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__noRel	I agree the comment section is for everyone- but what else can we do. Evidence has shown that hate speech can lead to real life crimes, and that needs to be tackled.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	There needs to be a moderator who is reviewing the comments that are made, I see a lot of inappropriate comments posted to news stories on the comments section of the news articles on facebook that incite arguments and hate speech. This is not acceptable and should not be allowed to happen.
__label__noRel	Who is to say what is or isn't 'harmful'? It sounds like you want to control a good chunk of the population who don't agree with you on things.	Where is the evidence for this?

__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it.

__label__noRel	I actually agree. Just have the news present a perspective. Readers can agree or disagree on their own.	Addressing hate speech should not mean prohibiting freedom of speech which is what you will be doing if the comments' section is removed. Instead a way to reduce the hate speech from escalating into something dangerous must be sourced and implemented. https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/UN%20Strategy%20and%20Plan%20of%20Action%20on%20Hate%20Speech%2018%20June%20SYNOPSIS.pdf

I was completely taken aback by some strong stances to remove the comment space, and the belief in that because Newspapers should be one-sided providers. I would disagree because newspaper share societal information and society should be allowed to engage and be part of the conversation instead of just consuming whatever information is being released for consumption. It has been seen as a result of other newspaper websites removing the comment section that it reduces the trust of the reader because they are aware of the bias of the information they are consuming, and also it reduces the amount of time readers spend on these sites because there is no community engagements.

__label__noRel	hate speech can not be given opportunity to thrive and or be heard. it should be removed the moment it is made	i do not agree with the method of doxxing people. hate speech has always existed, it is now on a more global scale because the world is more centralised as a result of social media. i believe the solution is censorship and moderation which sites like reddit and youtube already preactise.
__label__noRel	That is the problem not everyone thinks that they saying something hateful until someone mentions it.	What about allowing the comment section, but having a built-in screener running in the background, that automatically prevents posts with certain hateful words it is built to detect?

__label__noRel	Good. As long as it wasn't reported and the opinion was well written.	The difficulty with moderation is that it is subjective - if done so via human moderation if there is no existing framework to follow particular viewpoints or comments may not be seen to be worthy of removing though for others this may not be the case.

__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	I think with careful moderation, there's nothing wrong with keeping the comments section. Reddit is a fine example of extremely good moderation combined with bots that immediately remove content with insults and hatespeech.
__label__noRel	The comment section should not be taken out instead, they should use software that is able to detect hate speech and not allow it to be posted	I believe that people are allowed to express their opinions , that is why we have freedom of speech. However with that right, we are not subjected to hate speech, there are so many ways of expressing yourself without using offensive or hateful words. Considering a newspaper is a public platform, I believe everyone should try to be respective at all times. The comment space must not be removed, it helps to get insights of readers and is very helpful. I think the website should be enhanced in a way that it detects offensive language and doesn't allow the reader to continue if they use such. Also, comments should be monitored before being posted to the public.
__label__noRel	Algorithm not always working	There could also be a disclaimer added before one can see other comments which encourage readers to fact-check and be mindful of what they're reading, while also having moderators.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	But education and training and awareness are also needed, so people don't repeat what mistakes they have done in the past.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.

I agree with the notion that being able to share our thoughts and feelings is a right and having people share their views can help people to question their own thoughts. The inclusion of moderators to prevent people from posting discriminatory or harmful comments would be good, but difficult to ensure these moderators aren't biased towards one argument
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used...

__label__noRel	This article summarises it well	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	yes. good moderators are the key	Hate speech blocking will violate human rights to freedom of speech and cause people to feel opressed, as that would mean that they can not voice out their opinions.
__label__noRel	Potentially reduces correction or dissenting information on the article	I think that the warning system is a good route, as the AI might eliminate valid arguments and miss hate speech accidentally. A warning system would still need an AI, but it warns users that their comment may be hate speech and if it is, the user can rethink their wording or risk posting it. If they post it, maybe a manual review can happen to determine if it was hate speech or not.
__label__noRel	I agree, and this can be further enocouraged if the writerr or journalist engages with the comments that are being made on their story	Having a comments section can be ideal to engage in a healthy debate but will need to monitored very strictly to ensure there is no bullying or one sided views be taken against any individuals
__label__noRel	I think the comment space should be monitored by the newspaper for a more standard approach, because a lot of people have subjective views on what hate speech could be.	Have monitoring software be used. The comment section should not be removed, because it then deprives the general public of their opinion and freedom of speech as well as addressing any inaccuracies that were mentioned in articles.
__label__noRel	Discussions helps to deepen learning, to remove it completely would hinder what you could know but they need to be monitored for sure. Hate speech is not okay.	Education in media ethics: The first step in combating tribalized hate speech is realizing that, while the right to free expression is a fundamental human right, the rise of social media has produced a number of different channels for its creation, packaging, and transmission. The rights and liberties of journalists and their role in fostering and developing peaceful societies should be emphasized in media ethics education. The political, social, and cultural rights of individuals and groups, including the freedom of expression, must be made more widely known, as well as the obligations and societal repercussions that come with press freedom. Journalists need to have the knowledge and abilities to spot hate speech and disseminate anti-hate messaging.
__label__noRel	Your post contains the argument, "Newspapers should cancel comment space because it can create... fake news." I don't think this is particularly convincing. By that logic, newspapers and news websites themselves should be cancelled since they will periodically create "fake news" - sometimes not due to malice but rather by an honest mistake [or journalist incompetence/ignorance]. Ben Goldacre, for example, runs (ran?) a blog called, "Bad Science" and a recurring motif was journalists failing to accurately depict scientific insights. We could argue that their exagerrations and mistranslations could be construed as "fake news" but there's no malice involved. The journalists weren't trying to deceive anyone. The solution to getting closer to an approximation of truth is not to remove an entire avenue of communication, but rather to open up (regulated) communication in the hopes that the arguments that are most cogent rises above the rest - and that the logical wheat be separated from the illogical chaff. That is to say, I think we need a better system than just, "let's get rid of the comment section." It's a tricky problem, no doubt, and a perfect solution may not exist. But we should not let "perfect" get in the way of, "good enough." In a subsequent post, I detail ONE possible method that incorporates several solutions previously mentioned (and as I write this post, I thought of ways to improve it further. Not perfect, but perhaps good enough).	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	Concise opinions	report anyone as soon as it is seen so they can be dealt with and removed.

__label__noRel	I agree with you, online privacy is already a massive issue, I don't want to have to submit even more personal data (that could end up sold to advertisers) just to comment on an article. I also don't think 'tracking down' people who post hate speech online is practical or achievable.	I believe the following article could provide more information on hate speech, not only in the context of this discussion but as a whole and what can be done to combat it. https://www.stompoutbullying.org/blog/hate-speech

__label__noRel	This makes a good point. I think people should have freedome of speech but I also do think websites need to monitor comments.	Thank you for this!, this is a great idea
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it.

__label__noRel	Agreed! Probably can never get rid of it completely but taking steps to reducing it is 100% needed!	Holding platforms responsible for all content they publish would help
__label__noRel	I agree with both of these ideas. Having a moderation means consistency, but having other readers flag comments allows other commenters to hold peers to account and ensure that the comment section is an inclusive and fair section.	There is no cure for hate speech, but there is a way to stand up against it. Speak out against hate speech - fight racism and bigotry with love, empathy, compassion, and strength. We may not be able to eliminate hatred entirely, but the more steps we can take to educate and support human beings, and speak out against injustice, the better this world will become.

Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	Does not allow for positive feedback	Hate speech is not free speech. It must be banned
__label__noRel	What you are suggesting means that free speech should be limited to those articles that won't generate a conversation. If you look at https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/10/news-sites-that-turn-off-commenting-dont-drive-users-to-social-media-instead/ it shows that restricting or reducing comments can inflame a situation and cause irrational and trolling.	I found this really interesting, "Khan said the freedom of opinion and expression, including the right to seek, receive and disseminate diverse sources of information, must be upheld by States in times of crises and armed conflict as a precious ‘survival right’ on which people’s lives, health, safety, security and dignity depend." This is similar to what lots of people have been saying regarding worrying that this sort of censorhip could overextend. (https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/10/protect-freedom-expression-vital-survival-right-civilians-armed-conflict-un)
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Make readers agree to not sharing hate speech and let them know that if they do, they will be blocked from commenting.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I share the same opinion on that having a bot that can check for hate speech is the way either block users who use hate speech or put them on time out.	Hate speech blocking should not be implemented, people must learn to take some criticism in a positive way, it can be helpful.
__label__noRel	This is simplistic and would be very limited in its effectiveness.	Have human and AI to verify potential hateful speech. Given our current resources we should be able to allocate a human check given the rating of the flag by the AI
__label__noRel	this can work if they have a filtering system to filter out the the hate speech comments	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	I like this idea - there could also be a warning system for those reading the comments, if something does get published that possibly shouldn't have. A warning stating that the following comment may be offensive and contain hate speech.	There needs to be a moderator who is reviewing the comments that are made, I see a lot of inappropriate comments posted to news stories on the comments section of the news articles on facebook that incite arguments and hate speech. This is not acceptable and should not be allowed to happen.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	Newspaper websites should also be held accountable if they do not deal with hate speech
__label__noRel	I agree	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	It will help stop hate speech which is very important	Identifying users with hate speech and restricting their accounts from using the platform and commenting on it.
__label__noRel	Newspapers and the media have a big role to play, but so do others	Maybe if the comments were better moderated then this would reduce the amount of hate speech.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	when regulating the comments someone will always disagree or challenge the rules. Claim free speech has gone mad etc.	https://eachother.org.uk/would-removing-social-media-anonymity-protect-or-threaten-our-rights/ Perhaps hate comments could be reduced by removing the ability to post comments anonymously?
__label__noRel	I agree with this as it reflects my own view. Moderation is the way to go and not removal	More Admin and block buttons
__label__noRel	This is true in other countries as well, where even bills are put in place to silence those who effectively take part in hate speech. https://www.sanews.gov.za/south-africa/hate-speech-bill-will-assist-fight-against-racism#:~:text=The%20bill%20aims%20to%20provide,crime%20and%20hate%20speech%20offences.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	freedom speech is good but it assumes that common sense prevails too
__label__noRel	Exactly correct, there's no evidence to show removal or prohibition of user commentary actually reduces hate speech. Users simply find alternative means to express their thoughts. If you're aware of the popular meme 'in minecraft' illustrates this principle in its rudimentary form.	I think newspapers should not take away the comment section. Firstly this is unfair to all the people who want to have their say and should be able to do so Dominicis wrong
__label__noRel	some words should be muted or not allowed to be used in newspapers, because they are offensive or they contribute to hate speech	People will always spew hate speech and regulating it may be difficult to do. Freedom of speech should prevail therefore eliminating the comments section would be wrong. The newspaper site may have an automation that identifies hate words and whenever these appear the comment should be hidden from the comments section.
__label__noRel	I agree, this would be the perfect balance	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	Allow for a voting system on the comments, so as the cream rises to the top and the dredges sink away.
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	Sometimes, the vocal minority are the ones which are giving the hate speech, having a system allows a voice for those who don't want to speak	Newspaper websites can eliminate space for readers comments for articles that they think are more likely to receive more hate speech
__label__noRel	There is very little space for fake news to emerge as media houses would have approved the content or regulated the comment	Hate speech does more harm than good
__label__noRel	Facts	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	Recent political positions in the UK have lead to more fighting for 'free speech' and saying that it is ok to be offended - this is shown in a police news release (https://www.college.police.uk/article/protecting-freedom-expression-updated-guidance). I would disagree - offending people is unacceptable.
__label__noRel	I think people still have the right to comment on an article and give their opinion. It would be wrong to not permit this.	readers comments be moderated and anything that is harmful, hateful or hurtful should be removed. this allows people to exercise their right of freedom of speech but limiting the harm that someones opinion may have
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	Maybe AI could filter hate speech
__label__noRel	It is the best solution	realistically hate speech cannot be eliminated but preventative measures cane be put in place to minimise its presence
__label__noRel	Very funny.	https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-63291527
__label__noRel	I agree with this	People can express them selves however they like but they must be mindful to their language.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	I think there should at least be a 'report' button and any hate speech reported should be removed.
__label__noRel	i agree with this	I also believe that a filter or having a group of moderators constantly filtering out the negative - hate speech would be beneficial. Similar to other social media platforms, users of the platform perhaps should be allowed to flag or report comments that aren't appropriate,and then a moderator should check the report and take the steps necessary to make the platform a safe space.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	A pop-up can be used which reads "if any 'hate speech' comment is discovered, it will be removed from these comments".
__label__noRel	As much as I would *like to* agree, I unfortunately cannot. Free speech still IS a part of free speech. I'm afraid you can't have one or the other - they are co-dependent as I believe, humans are inherently seeking conflict.	In today's world where technology has advanced to such a degree, I'm of the belief that creating parameters that protect individuals from any form of hate speech is very much possible through things such as AI. The removing of commenting sections could be argued as a violation to one's freedom of speech, it also means the views and opinions of the public will be lost which could have detrimental effects.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	Removing the comment section will only create a bigger revolt and uprise from people that write hate speech, and it will move to another media outlets. So the problem should be treated not silenced it. It is the responsibility of newspapers websites to police hate speech in order to create a safe environment for an healthy discussion about a news article. Otherwise you are cutting short an experience that users might want to have. So by censoring all the comment section your make erverybody pay a price for something that they haven't done. Moderation is the key and should be done my the newspapers websites according to the values they have.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	Be more strict when allowing people to create profiles, that require identification before allowing anybody to comment. If they choose to be anonymous do not allow them to comment.
__label__noRel	In my opinion freedom of speech stops when it is directed hate towards a person or a group of people. Online platforms do not have to tolerate hate speech on their platforms.	I think that readers who use hate speech should be reported and temporarily banned from the site, as I believe that we need comments section in online newspaper articles. It is important to share your views as we have freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I believe that newspaper articles know the consequences of any article they put up and the kind of comments that may arise from such, it is therefor their responsibility to prevent such from occuring.	create an algorithm that identifies hate speech and removes it
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	I think that the introduction of moderators to remove any hate speech would be beneficial. Perhaps the introduction of guidelines as to what constitutes permitted negative comments.
__label__noRel	Could you elaborate?	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	zero pros	I think newspapers websites should have an online system that can detect hate speech and block users that use this kind of language but keeping it open for negative or positive feedback would be fair but not giving readers the freedom to use hate speech.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	Agree, moderation is the way to go, as hate speech should not be part of any media forums.	as long as good moderators are in place, hate speech and disrespectful comments will be weeded out.
__label__noRel	I agree with Andrew. It can also be a form of bullying and those most likely to be affected are the more vulnerable people in society.	I think there should at least be a 'report' button and any hate speech reported should be removed.
__label__noRel	who is in charge of moderating the conversation and who decides what is permitted to be discussed? Moderating conversation is a very dangerous precedent	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	I think we have to use some fact checking system that allows us to present thoughts and opinions, the system can block derogatory comments. This allows for a calm debate
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	A system should be developed to detect certain words that are considered as hate speech. This will help prevent or eliminate hate speech comments
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?

Having a screaning for all comments before they go up on the platform to make sure that they are not posted on the site.
__label__noRel	Really like that idea	By having an administrator who is able to monitor any comment posted, and removing hateful speech and giving warning to hateful viewers
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	Agreeing with others here: a standard of moderation would have to be communicated to the user, with straightforward policies of flagging or reporting potentially hateful comments. A synthesis of live and algorithmic moderators might be best, as certain words can be auto-flagged for review, whereas other things might involve a more delicate touch.
__label__noRel	the comments section lets you know what sort of paper you are reading, if its full of loonies then youre probably in the wrong place!	By a combination of monitoring and blocking people who leave such comments, and also having suitable laws in place to back this up
__label__noRel	Moderation is a good idea	I think filtering hate speech comments can do that and allowing a better more positive and a welcome experience to all readers.
__label__noRel	yes, I feel that if freedom of speech incites violence against a person or a specific race then it should not be permitted.

__label__noRel	so moderators and filters are needed	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.

__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	I feel like there are certain topics for which disabling comments is the best option. For example extremely sensitive stories about severe crimes or ones that involve children.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	Often people are just looking for information and news anyone. After all paper newspapers don't have a comment section that anyone can just have their comment appear in automatically!

Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__noRel	The newspapers will not get to know how people realy feel about the issue at hand if the comment space is closed. The dialogue will be one sided	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	I agree but what is to be done about those who use hate speech? Do we just let them be? And what about the newspaper's reputation? Should they be known as a newspaper that allows people to comment on whatever they like with no repercussions?	The comment section needs to be moderated using some kind of filter to automatically filter any words on the banned list and then use a report system to flag up anything which tries to bypass this. This will allow a human moderator to quickly decide what can be kept and what needs action.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	Filter words so if a comment contains this word it will be reviewed as to if it is appropriate or automatically deleted
__label__noRel	This allows for people to understand that something will be done if they conduct hate speech.	Implementing a software that detects comments including hate speech, like the ones on social networks. Also including a report button for poeple to report hate speech comments
__label__noRel	A way to deal with this could be starting laws against hate speech or have punishments in place.	By having stricter controls over who can sign up to the comments and blocking them from the sites when they use hate speech. It's unfortunate that it happens, but sometimes they are loud just to get attention. Starve them of it.
__label__noRel	Accountability is a great idea	Block known accounts with a history of hate speech
__label__noRel	A combination of volunteer human and algorithm moderation is already used on sites like Reddit. While it's not perfect, it's less rigid than fully automated moderation and allows communities to set their own rules.	Hate speech is a form of self publicity. If the community isolates the perpetrators by flagging negative content that would be helpful. Flagged content would then need to be followed by banning perpetrators
__label__noRel	Sometimes being harsh can be kind to the person who may not realise what they're doing.	I think that the idea of users submitting personal data before making a comment can have positive and negative effects - positive in the sense that the user may think twice before posting hate speech and that they can be tracked down and educated; negative in the sense that the user could be on a website that wants to use user's personal data for the wrong reasons. I am still of the view that comments with hate speech need to be filtered out because each individual needs to be responsible in their speech.
__label__noRel	It also promotes cyberbullying ,saying it is a free speech.	Filter words so if a comment contains this word it will be reviewed as to if it is appropriate or automatically deleted
__label__noRel	Thats why its best to have set rules. Like swear language, certain words, threats and stuff like that but anything that is just opinion should be allowed no matter if you disagree or don't like what is said.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	Allows less bias when reading or consuming news content	Limiting the algorithms push to only show negative or controversial viewpoints would go a long way to decreasing the hate comments.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	This is a good article in how to combat hate speech comments: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793
__label__noRel	I believe that punishment would cause more polarization because people may have more negative feelings towards newspaper websites with comments sections. Like what AllisonK said, education is a better preventative measure. If punishment is necessary, it should involve education that the commentator actively engages in.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	I agree	I know this has been discussed a few times potentially in reply to comments but I'd like to repeat it again: language is complex and you can't simply ban or flag certain terms or phrases and think you catch all the hate speech comments etc. While a report button and the use of a software that can support a human moderator is in essence a good idea, it might also delete comments that do not actually contain HS or completely miss others overall. I think this decision by the newspaper turned into an entire discussion of manageability of monitoring discussion sections and away from the ethical considerations.
__label__noRel	agree	Disabling comments reduces free speech and makes everything monitored and authorised - then you have to question who is controlling what we see?
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	ensures a safe and protected readers environment	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	Using moderators, educating users, calling out trolls and haters!
__label__noRel	People would be more careful with what they say	newspapers should not have a comments section.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	There should be automatic filters but they are not 100, so there should also be a team of people constanly monitoring and reviewing complaints and reports. I feel like it is the only way to keep the freedom of speech but also protect people who might be victims of it.
__label__noRel	The United Nations have outlined what hate soeech is here, so this could be used overall as a rule of thumb... https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech	This is not just a newspaper comment section problem... it's a social media problem as well, more like an internet problem. We need way to not push people away, but educate them. Because the truth is, nobody starts out as a hater but radicaliz ation can happen to anyone. check https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P55t6eryY3g
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.

__label__noRel	Even if someone provides their personal details many people are still not deterred from commenting hate speech proof of this is that in Facebook where most people have their personal information they still comment hate speech in the comments on posts	Comments are important as it can help create a balanced view and promote healthy discussion, maybe software could pick up on key words or phrases and then a moderator could look more in depth at questionable comments.
__label__noRel	I totally disagree with this, If the newspaper is not the place for comments then where would they get the platform to voice out their convictions	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	Anonymity may also prevent people to explore ideas they feel are taboo and prevent them from seeking help. e.g. addiction, some LGBTQ+ issues that are taboo in certain cultures etc.	report comment buttons could be useful but there should be monitors that check comments before they are allowed to be posted
__label__noRel	Although i understand why limiting comments would reduce hate speech, unfortunately it then plays to the smaller group in society that causes the problems. The majority of people can have a great debate without taking to name calling etc	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	true, but maybe they can remove anonymity so that everyone can be accountable for what they say.	Completely removing the comment section is out of the question. How else is the audience supposed to interact with the material and each other? the feedback could be useful to the writer too for future articles pertaining to similar topics.
__label__noRel	Only allowing paying users might result in the most of the users in a comment section having the same view. For example, many young people do not use newspaper websites. Each comment section might not be diverse at all in type of users or the opinions being shared. Is an echo chamber better, equal to, or worse than a few hate comments?	I'm not sure if it will work but they can put a sign on the website that says no to hate comments allowed. Or a report button can also help then administrator can review the reported comments
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	We do have to allow people to express their opinions - we can't pretend opinions don't exist. Having them out in the open lets us know what we're dealing with. But at the same time hate speech can't be allowed to flourish and absolutely needs to be challenged. There is a role for AI (which I have said before I know) to try and weed out and remove anything that is just pure hate and not any sort of coherent argument or opinion.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	The comment section must be cut off
__label__noRel	Absolutely, the issue of sharing inflammatory or misleading news is important to address and change. News outlets are responsible for how they present their stories and how the narrative changes in the comment section below. They're also responsible for the real world violence as a result of willingly hosting hate speech on their platform whether they're active or inactive on their handling of the comments sections.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	some people would still make hate comments, as they could give a false name to begin with.	we could filter the comments and have a panel to decide
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	Hate speech is not free speech. It must be banned
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	Letting individuals know that as soon as someone comments, that is no longer confidential and if it is hate speech they shall be reported to authorities
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	Having moderators remove hateful speech and providing better education.
__label__noRel	But have you considered which one has more serious effects and consequences? I think that should be guiding in the main argument on whether to allow commenting or allow hate speech	i am totally against any form of censorship in newspaper comment sections
__label__noRel	Agreed, just a simple implementation of guidelines can go a long way just as stated in the following article https://help.ft.com/faq/commenting-on-articles/what-are-your-commenting-guidelines/	We can have a system where every comment has to be checked and vetted for hate speech and if it infringes on any of the platform's rules and regulations then the comment is automatically removed.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	Agreed, it's totally problematic once you start to censor opinion over simply bad language and obvious hate speech.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	a team of moderators won't be a viable option because, because people can't posts comments in real time	Letting individuals know that as soon as someone comments, that is no longer confidential and if it is hate speech they shall be reported to authorities
__label__noRel	I think it is the responsibility of the websites to moderate any hatefull comments. You can agree and disagree with somthing without hate.	Have a moderator than overlooks all readers comments and makes sure they're all suitable.
__label__noRel	good idea but you nead the right person with a good moral compass on board,to give a level playing field for all.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	I appreciate the balance here.	There is a careful balance to be made between protecting others from the effects of hate speech and protecting free speech. Online hate speech unfortunately can have the effect of increasing violence against minorities (https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons) but blocking all free speech because of the actions of a few seems like a poor decision. More must be done to remove hate speech online quickly and this means spending more money tackling it.
__label__noRel	yes this is the best way to reduce hate speech while still allowing readers to comment their opinion	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	People will always spew hate speech and regulating it may be difficult to do. Freedom of speech should prevail therefore eliminating the comments section would be wrong. The newspaper site may have an automation that identifies hate words and whenever these appear the comment should be hidden from the comments section.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	removing comment sections takes away the chance to interact with others about a topic you care about	there must be a way to build in logarithms to find certain words or phrases
__label__noRel	Taking away comments will mean a one sided news media and that is dangerous.	The only possible way to reduce hate speech is to have some kind of algorithm that may recognise certain words and phrases. Other than that it would mean moderating the comment section.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	i do not agree with the method of doxxing people. hate speech has always existed, it is now on a more global scale because the world is more centralised as a result of social media. i believe the solution is censorship and moderation which sites like reddit and youtube already preactise.
__label__noRel	This sounds like a very expensive solution - I think maybe more time and money should be spent on algorithms that can do the same thing	It hink a moderation is required for hate speech. Removing the entire comment section is not an ideal option. However, hate speech is alsoa crime. It is clear that there should be some monitoring in social media in terms of tracking down the user when necessary so similar terms with the real world would be valid. If you make a crime in real word you get you will stand trial so similar option should be valid for social media.
__label__noRel	I agree that hate speech should not be tolerated, but I don't think that it requires the total removal of space for comments, as the comments add value. I believe that moderation is the way forward.	If comments that create hate speech are removed/moderated, you can not complain about loss of freedom of speech as you are then being discrimantory, rather than speaking freely, and there is a difference.
__label__noRel	Yes, you can have your own opinion but that doesnt mean you have the right to spread hate.	Reduce the anonymity that hate-speech writers can hide behind - without that shield some may be less inclined to post because it can be traced back to them
__label__noRel	It could take a long time for them to be reviewed, leaving the conversation no longer relevant.	most people seem to be of the opinion that cutting comments altogether is not constructive. A good point was made by an individual that viewing opinions from people you like only doesn't help you to grow (echo chamber).
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	Maybe the only solution is to remove the space for comments? We see the same issues on other platforms that allow comments!
__label__noRel	I believe that punishment would cause more polarization because people may have more negative feelings towards newspaper websites with comments sections. Like what AllisonK said, education is a better preventative measure. If punishment is necessary, it should involve education that the commentator actively engages in.	Nowadays with the amount of social media platforms that are available newspapers don't hold as much power. We get all of our news through the spreading of news in social media as seen in this article : https://kettlemag.co.uk/social-media-versus-print-media/
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	They can be made visible	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	some people "troll" by writing inflammatory remarks, but it is fundamental to a free society to have free discussion. Any attempts at calling something "hate speech" will be only about stopping anything that goes against the narratives of the rich establishment.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	Make readers agree to not sharing hate speech and let them know that if they do, they will be blocked from commenting.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	Some people will always use hate speech and hide behind their computer, There needs to be some sort of filter added to flag such comments and people and a ban put on the user
__label__noRel	I disagree with this because newspapers can lose readers due to poor interaction	i think one can filter the comment so that only the comment that show love are seen by people
__label__noRel	That will just give newspaper websites the opportunity to publish fake news without anyone challenging them (https://en.unesco.org/sites/default/files/journalism_fake_news_disinformation_print_friendly_0.pdf). for example, if they post fake news about covid, no one will challenge them and anyone who doesn't have enough information will believe what the article says.	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__noRel	Persons would consider their thoughts more carefully.	Is space for readers comment really that necessary? Nowadays, with all other social medias available, the conversation can happen on platform made for dialogue. But as practice shows, those "conversations" are often very polarized and everyone is kind of screaming in a void.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	Free speech is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it is necessary for an effective democratic society and on the other hand, people tend to abuse the right. Newspapers and publishing companies are major symbols of free speech, however, and there will always be disadvantages to be endured, hate speech inclusive. The solution is not to disable comment spaces but to continually implore and push for cooperation amongst readers.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	I think that education with penalties such as exclusion from the community for repeated offences is the best policy. Like many I agree that some people are unaware they unaware they have caused offence to others.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	I also think the concept of Counterspeech to reduce the impact of hate speech could be beneficial.https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/counterspeech-better-way-tackling-online-hate
__label__noRel	I agree. Considering much of this hate speech comes from bots it is impossible to keep up with it. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20563051221104749	I do not think it is possible, in a fair and just way. When speech is restricted that's called censorship. Who would justify the restrictive opinion?
__label__noRel	i agree that it can help develop a story and provide or increase the information around it from people who know more	Newspaper websites should also be held accountable if they do not deal with hate speech
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.

__label__noRel	you can't exclude people from their own community	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	With rights comes responsibility. We all have freedom of speech but it is our responsibility to ensure that our speech does not cause harm on others. If people do not want to be responsible in their speech, then their speech should be reduced because things have consequences. So, the hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by removing comments with hate speech or having a software that can identify hate speech in a comment before it is posted.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	I agree with this point. Hate speech just spreads more hate among people.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news.

__label__noRel	This would be removing freedom of speech. I think that is a very problematic road to go down.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Just allow people to report bad comments and when it gets to a certain number it should delete the message and send an automatic email to the person who wrote it with a warning.
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	Moderation of the comments section
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	I think that a comment section is necessary for engagement and exchange of ideas but having said that, there should be a code for AI embedded within that platform which will be able to detect hate speech or words classified as hate speech then the AI can delete them automatically. Also people can report the comment and the AI should delete the comment within minutes of it being reported.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can unfortunetely bean opinion base within this modern world. Being oversentativie to certain comments can pottentially reduce freedom of speech.	I agree with some other opinions on the use of A1 to flag or censor certain words that constitute hate or violent speech. It would also be beneficial to have a human supervisor from the organisation and another external body review the activities of the AI to ensure accuracy and consistency.
__label__noRel	It is still difficult because then you are removing everyone's entitlement to an opinion	Newspaper websites should invest more in technology that can be used to detect hate speech and not allow it to be posted. They should only allow comments posted in the language that the software will understand so that it is able to eliminate hate speech without difficulties. they should also be willing to punish people who post hate speech by reporting them to the authorities.

I would almost agree that removing the comments would be beneficial. I've very rarely seen a comment on an article that actually contributed towards learning more about the content. It's typically just people yelling they don't agree without any true thought.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	It has been suggested that hiding comments rather than removing them is the best way forward. Commenters don't like their posts to be deleted, understandably, and often feel censored which can cause them to lash out with further offensive comments. By hiding a comment, the original poster can still see it and may not realise that it has been hidden from others which minimises upset caused to others whilst preserving the original poster's involvement. https://blog.brandbastion.com/deleting-comments-can-trigger-backlash	I disagree. Comments might be useful for users and also the owners of the newspapers. Though, asking people to identify themselves when registering could help reduce hate speech, as people would not be able to do whatever they want anonymously.
__label__noRel	I agree	people feel powerful behind an anonymous account, its easier to say things you would never normally say under the guise of anonymity, if it was easier to link a comment to who it came from and if people actually faced consequences from posting hate then this could help stop it.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	I think if all comments go under review for hate speech, that should still allow a chance for hate speech comments to be retracted
__label__noRel	Im not sure moderation would be the difinitive solution	The root cause of most issues is likely from a select few, root out the troublemakers and ban accordingly.
__label__noRel	The downside to this is who will moderate and what will be their baseline. It's a real challenge.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	That's not true, there are millions of platforms to hold conversation about news articles without talking directly under them. Everything they right is open to public scrutiny.	Hate speech must be eliminated. The only way to do this thoroughly is with human moderation.
__label__noRel	people should be heard	i believe comment are important, to allow people to discuss. sometimes you can get factual information from other people comments

__label__noRel	I think it is important for newspapers to provide a platform for people to express and discuss their opinions.

__label__noRel	Not so much swearing and negativity.	i agree that people have the right to express their own ideas but you have to be considerate otherwise it can easily be interpreted as hate if your not careful with wordings.

__label__noRel	Moderators also have bias	The key way to do it would be with very in-depth moderation which is non-biased and respects criticisms but its aware when a comment is taken too far and viewed as hate speech. the comment section should not be eliminated but mainly moderated and supervised
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	While censoring certain words in the context of a comment would help reduce hate speech, an issue that would need to be considered is the use of images used as hate speech. Some "memes" can contain hate speech to the AI may misinterpret this as a regular image while the image could be posted as hate speech. An example of this is when people on Reddit use images as "memes" containing racism and sometimes the bot does not flag it as racism. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230
__label__noRel	I don't agree with handing over a lot of personal data as this could be misused and seems like an overstep of personal freedoms and privacy	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.

It is important that people are able to have a voice, especially as it can be a great tool in educating people, and giving people a variety of viewpoints that they wouldn't necessarily get to often hear.

__label__noRel	https://diverseminds.co.uk/hatecrime/ - As much as you say this the effects of hate crime on an individual are not anything that should be allowed to flourish. If newspapers where to physically allow and endorse this type of "free speech" on their platform they simply shouldn't be able to have a platform. It also gives right of way for those who think with pure ignorance to voice a factually incorrect and exaggerated opinion. These are not the types of opinions that should be openly shared or taught on the internet and in any given situation that it could happen they need to restrict it. To reduce free speech may be an infringement but allow hateful speech is just wrong.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it.

__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	We can start by encouraging people to debate and say their opinions to incite meaningful and helpful conversations and comments instead of hate and other harmful communication types

__label__noRel	moderator could remove the part of sentence and not the whole post instead, so that the entire post is not unreadable, the person could have a valid point, just not written it in a better way,	Computers should be able to detect hate speech if there is any and report and remove that comment whinin minutes of posting it
__label__noRel	One sided opinions	Have human and AI to verify potential hateful speech. Given our current resources we should be able to allocate a human check given the rating of the flag by the AI
__label__noRel	I agree with you on this, it's helping someone with a job, and it protects the person in the article from hate speech.	By simply educating people about what harm hate speech can do to a person
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	Holding platforms responsible for all content they publish would help
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	agree with not deleting comments, we should live it open and just regulated
__label__noRel	Not so much swearing and negativity.	I tend to agree that newspapers should provide spaces for dicussion. It encourages people to read about the topic before making comments and peopel can easily reference reference the article in their comments. I think this allows for a more fruitful and productive discussion that on other platforms e.g. social media. However, hate speech is certainly an issue and easily derails conversations. While moderation of hate speech would be ideal, the burden on the newspaper is likely too great to do this manually. Perhaps a mixture of auto-moderation (flagging/removing key words), manual review by the newspaper and some form of community moderation may work well together.
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	Allowing people who have profiles with the website to comment. Anonymity should not be allowed. Information that is traceable to an individual could be implemented(even though may be intrusive) could be requested when creating a profile. Examples, a cellphone number that is FICAd , student number, loyalty card number and the like.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	The right to free speech doesn't mean there are no consequences for hate speech. Tolerating hate speech is not going to make it go away.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	Ask people to be respectful and back-up their opinions factually. The danger, of course, is attaching URLs or info that themselves propagate misinformation by presenting it as fact.
__label__noRel	other points of view should always be welcomed	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	I feel like there are certain topics for which disabling comments is the best option. For example extremely sensitive stories about severe crimes or ones that involve children.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	But how would one be able to determine what is hate speech and what isn’t? For example someone could say the word n*gger in context of a historical discussion. Some black people would consider it hate speech and others wouldn’t. With people deciding what is and what isn’t hate speech with their subjective opinions, genuine non-hatefuelled opinions would not be posted and as a result this method would inhibit free speech unfairly to some degree.	People can express them selves however they like but they must be mindful to their language.
__label__noRel	Don't delete the comment section, at some point you will realise that some criticism are inconsequential	by blocking users who violate 'hate speech rules', i feel it should be clearly stated what hate speech is.
__label__noRel	This is true, moreover as it is said in this article https://medium.com/@flytedesk/the-pros-and-cons-of-removing-a-website-comment-section-9bea62f8e42b, removing a comment section might be thought by some users as a going against free speech and they will also spend less time on the website, leading to worse performances of the brand/website.	I think rather than removing the option to comment/debate below an article, there could be moderators and hate speech buttons and bots to keep hate speech at bay.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	Sadly I must agree. Ongoing monitoring of comments would take too much effort and time. It is simpler to just remove the comments and let the newspaper articles stand for themselves. Pople can always link the article to their own twitter post and comment there if they feel the need to add their own thoughts.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	I am not sure collecting data about the person before posting will help with tracing them down and trying to re-educate them. Just blocking the post and providing a response to them saying their post is not accepted by the platform is more appropriate.	People should be told about hate speech and how it affects other people and I think people who participate in hate speech should have some sort of panishment.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	The idea that media should be able to stop a conversation is wrong and this is what would happen if comments were removed.
__label__noRel	Having rules will make online engagement respectful.	More Admin and block buttons
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	One solution to reduce hate speech is by disabling the comment section altogether for most important topics/controversial topics.

__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	The only way to combat hate speech is through open debate. Restricting any form of speech (even hate speech) could lead to hateful views becoming unchallenged and potentially result in violence. There is also the issue that newspapers could define hate speech as certain comments they don't like destroying any potential for open debate. By maintaining open debate hate speech can be called out and as a result, become less frequent.
__label__noRel	agree	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	Newspapers should have an algorithm that catches certain words or phrases which are hateful in nature. These words will be automatically flagged up and accounts that are flagged x amount of times should then be restricted from commenting for a period of time. If after this period, they continue to try and post comments with hateful content, they should be banned entirely from commenting.
__label__noRel	you cannot control people and there opinions.	Just pay moderators
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	Regulations of comment sections has been proven with various other platforms to be the best solution.

A ban from the being able to comment for a certain period of time.
__label__noRel	True picture of peoples lives will be shared and discussed	An article proving AI can be helpful, but can struggle to interpret or detect certain things, suggesting manual reviewing is still very important. https://www.latrobe.edu.au/nest/can-combat-rise-online-hate-speech/ On another note, I also think anonymity plays a huge role in what people allow themselves to post online and think that certain platforms should consider only allowing people to comment under their own identity rather than online handles and such.

__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way.

__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	I think comments give the ability to the users to express their opinion on what is described in the articles and this is an important rule for democracy. Removing the ability to comment in my view is basically limiting free speech. I also believe that user do not need necessarily to be identifiable, being anonymous is fine as long as they respect others and their opinions.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	educate young people on online politeness for want of a better word word have meaning and consequences in the real world and individuals have to take responsibility and not hide behind keyboards
__label__noRel	I totally agree. There are people who like to read comments. It is also a right to express an opinion.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

Issues around hate speech bring into clear relief the emergence of private spaces for expression that serve a public function, this may lead to violence or non-radical behaviors for the public at large. The only possible way of reduction is for writers to not write or give out any opinions of hate speech. This will ensure that readers are comfortable.

__label__noRel	Individual currators personal bias	We do have to allow people to express their opinions - we can't pretend opinions don't exist. Having them out in the open lets us know what we're dealing with. But at the same time hate speech can't be allowed to flourish and absolutely needs to be challenged. There is a role for AI (which I have said before I know) to try and weed out and remove anything that is just pure hate and not any sort of coherent argument or opinion.

__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	Commenters should agree to abide by all rules when signing up to the website and he banned for breaking the rules. Also all submitted comments must be thoroughly checked for negative for flagged words or topics.

__label__noRel	I completely agree that education should be involved. The issue is that this doesn't have immediate affects and therefore this is why moderating the comment sections combined with education is key.	I do not think it is possible, in a fair and just way. When speech is restricted that's called censorship. Who would justify the restrictive opinion?
__label__noRel	It could be tried	most people seem to be of the opinion that cutting comments altogether is not constructive. A good point was made by an individual that viewing opinions from people you like only doesn't help you to grow (echo chamber).

Allowing people to post their opinions is healthy and a normal part of human society- people will not always agree. However, in order to reduce hate speech, which can so often lead to crime, it could be done so that there are monitors (either human or computer) who check comments before they are posted to ensure they are not hate speech.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	The question is? Is hate speech not part of free speech? I think people should be left to express themselves however they feel is appropriate as long as they are not breaking an laws

__label__noRel	The media should not be in control of what we view, though. And I can see the side of your thinking. Perhaps with the option to view said removed comments makes this more plausible for you? I wonder how that changes your opinion, if at all of course.	Censor out words
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

Certain individuals thrive on adding fuel to fire. In this case having the comment section deleted would be a positive thing. On the other hand only by having differing opinions can discussions and debates happen. So if someone spews hate speech only then can we see the extent to which someone disagrees with a certain group/viewpoint etc. https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea
__label__noRel	Sometimes computer algorithms get things wrong	What about allowing the comment section, but having a built-in screener running in the background, that automatically prevents posts with certain hateful words it is built to detect?
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions

__label__noRel	This is frequently used in social media platforms now, but it can be quite time consuming. Also the tone of a statement can be misinterpreting in text format.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	There is no cure for hate speech, but there is a way to stand up against it. Speak out against hate speech - fight racism and bigotry with love, empathy, compassion, and strength.

__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	Only People from certain age should be allowed to comment
__label__noRel	This is a fair point -- maybe removing the influence of comment sections altogether will stop the trend of news increasingly becoming 'comment' and being less objective in reporting. If people want to exercise their free speech about the article's content, they can still share the article and express their opinions on it elsewhere, like on their personal social media channels.	The way to fairly reduce hate speech is to use a mix of technology and human intervention to manage the potential volume of moderation required to provide a healthy environment for discussion. There are a number of tools available that allow for pre- and post-moderation to curb the worst excesses of user comments. This can be further enhanced by requiring readers to give a little more data about themselves to reduce the anonymity which provides a cloak for the potentially worst expressions of hatred.
__label__noRel	this is a great way to monitor	One way I propose to prevent hate speech is to remove anonymity online. Not being able to hide should limit cowardly behavior and thus reduce harmful speech.

An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	Comments should add to the article though and the commenters often go down a facebook-style rant about something not helpful or relevant, I don't think this is the right space for this	rules for discussion could be posted before giving the access, mention that chat moderators are following all discussions and hate speech will be removed if occures.
__label__noRel	Newspapers do not want to face critism by removing comments column, unfair society	Allow others users to rate the comments and block those who receive bad ratings
__label__noRel	I think people having to give personal data will make people think before they post hate speech or negative comments.	I think that moderation is the most effective way of preventing hate speech. Filtering comments would not work as it is difficult to find a algorithm for the context of a comment. Free speech is so important it should not be removed.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	I think it is important for people to be able to comment on newspapers websites, but I think there needs to be a way of moderating the comments section to prevent/remove hate speech.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Newspaper websites should also be held accountable if they do not deal with hate speech
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	It hink a moderation is required for hate speech. Removing the entire comment section is not an ideal option. However, hate speech is alsoa crime. It is clear that there should be some monitoring in social media in terms of tracking down the user when necessary so similar terms with the real world would be valid. If you make a crime in real word you get you will stand trial so similar option should be valid for social media.
__label__noRel	Hate speech causes more harm than good.	Reduce hate speech by screening out certain words. If a comment contains such words, it is deleted or hidden from public view
__label__noRel	Stops hates speech	By a combination of monitoring and blocking people who leave such comments, and also having suitable laws in place to back this up
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Hate speech is something people intentionally and so if people continue to participate in it, they should be punished.
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	The algorithm should have code that detects certain hate speech words and shadow bans them so as they do not appear on the site. with a warning that it will happen if the post is posted.
__label__noRel	I think using personal data would be tricky. Many companies have been caught selling user's data without consent or storing it in an unsafe way, which could harm those affected by hate speech more than those who post it	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	That is actually a good idea, but gives a lot of power to the moderators.	Every person should be traceable, so they are accountable. If your comments consist of hate speech or are offensive then you be accounable.
__label__noRel	Removing the comment section will not solve the problem but cause further frustration. It also takes away the opportunity for people to engage about issues and share ideas.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.

__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	I think you could ban some words or have someone checking the comments and deleting the ones that are unappropiate, but limiting the whole comment section would be a mistake
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	the website should have terms and conditions on the words that can be used and warnings if failure to follow the recommended words .
__label__noRel	I think this is true and there is no need for spiteful comments to be made and ruin someone's day.	I have no real interest in reading readers comments sections in newspapers, but I don't agree that they should be eliminated. The content can be moderated to remove hate speech. This be done by a moderator, or these days, by AI.
__label__noRel	I agree	It seems like many users think that having your personally details posted along with your comment would be a deterrent for people to comment hate speech
__label__noRel	I agree	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words.

__label__noRel	it would definitely help to reduce hate speech and remove hateful language	I am unsure if there is a way to reduce hate speech. One persons 'hate speech' is anothers 'freedom of speech'. As a supposedly democratic nation, we need to be able to permit people from all walks of lives and experiences to air their own personal views, whether these are educated views or not.
__label__noRel	But who defines what is 'hate' speech? People who share a different opinion to the author or another reader?	ALthough the idea of free speech is important, it cannot be used as an excuse to upset others and use racist/sexist/ violent language.

The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	Overall I think I agree with some of the mentions that removing the comments section does reduce freedom of speech. We should be allowed to comment and share opinions on any topic as long as it isn't hate speech.
__label__noRel	Comments would need to be approved before being posted.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform.

It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed

__label__noRel	No hate speech	block swearing, abusive, discrimatory words- freedom of speech without rasicism, name calling etc
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	I think that education is the way to go about it, Humans must respect opposing views of others and tolerant society should be encouraged at all times instead of censorship
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	I think in order to eliminate hate speech, the comment section itself must be completely eradicated to take a way all potential risk. Newspapers have the sole purpose of giving accurate depictions of current events, there is no responsibility for them to offer social commentary space. One only has to look at the hatred filled comments of the Daily Mail web pages to see the concerning language being used on a regular basis.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	The downside to this is who is going to moderate it - where is the baseline of what is acceptable and what is not. It's a real challenge.	Although it would be fair to allow for both critical and positive input, I believe that newspaper websites should have a mechanism in place that can identify hate speech and restrict individuals who use it. This would prevent readers from freely using hate speech.

__label__noRel	Do you believe that a newspaper comment section is an appropriate system for dialogue with someone spreading hateful messages?	I believe that people are allowed to express their opinions , that is why we have freedom of speech. However with that right, we are not subjected to hate speech, there are so many ways of expressing yourself without using offensive or hateful words. Considering a newspaper is a public platform, I believe everyone should try to be respective at all times. The comment space must not be removed, it helps to get insights of readers and is very helpful. I think the website should be enhanced in a way that it detects offensive language and doesn't allow the reader to continue if they use such. Also, comments should be monitored before being posted to the public.
__label__noRel	I agree	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__noRel	every online space should have moderation its weird that this is even a discussion	Removing the comment facility in no way infringes free speech. The content providers, newspapers, are at liberty to provide discussion space or not as they see fit. The use of a moderator might be useful but this seems a great investment of time to little effect. There are obviously those who enjoy using comment spaces to express extreme and unthought out opinions as well as to insert hate speech. Perhaps only those who have subscribed to a news source should be allowed to comment.

Completely doing away with the comment section would not be beneficial to the readers experience as reading other peoples thoughts is what sets online media apart from offline media. It plays a role in keeping the discussion going. It would be smart to rather monitor comments to ensure hate speech or utterances of a vile nature are greatly reduced through the use of some sort of algorithm that picks up on problematic words and deletes comments or it being done manually by people who will moderate the comment section.

I think the first step to reducing hate speech in readers comments should be in the form of a moderation team in which they filter inappropriate comments. I think it should be a group of people rather than AI to do this to ensure all hate speech within a variety of contexts are eliminated, as if this was done by a computer there is risk of hate spilling through. For example, hate speech on the social media platform Twitter can often be missed as users purposefully misspell hateful speech to ensure it does not flag up on the AI searches, going as far as hateful language misspelt actually trending on Twitter.

__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	Alternatively I'd offer the opinion that goes against the question and states that we shouldn't offer a space for readers comments (and thus hate speech) at all on news since it's primarily a site and source for news. Systems like https://ground.news/ have been providing news and removing bias without a social aspect already and since third party social/sharing/commentary sites handle discussion and the problem of hate speech far better than newspaper websites presumably can hope to, the solution seems intuitive: remove it and let that happen organically on other websites and platforms.

__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	Removing the comment section will only create a bigger revolt and uprise from people that write hate speech, and it will move to another media outlets. So the problem should be treated not silenced it.

I think filtering hate speech comments can do that and allowing a better more positive and a welcome experience to all readers.
__label__noRel	but how do you reduce hate speech	the comment section is for sharing information and opinions without the need of hate speech. those who promote and share hate speech should get banned from the comment section
__label__noRel	This is frequently used in social media platforms now, but it can be quite time consuming. Also the tone of a statement can be misinterpreting in text format.	By flagging certain vocabulary which relates to hate speech and once this is flogged, the person commenting is blocked from posting their view. We would need to look at ways of getting around mispellings of the words though, as people could use this to get past the AI.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	If eliminating readers comments is out of the question, then it must be that hate speech is recognized and removed before a comment is even published. People use the free speech argument but free speech isn't 100% guaranteed in cases of speech causing harm (e.g. Yelling fire in a crowded theatre). Hate speech causes harm.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	Moderating comments sections is a lot of work to do manually, the individuals tasked with it would burn out in short time trying to manage that effectively while also having to read hateful garbage all day. If there was a system to remove hate speech it needs to be automated with an algorithm that catches certain words, then reviewed manually when someone disagrees with the content removed and it not being against guidelines. We use guidelines for everything including media regulations for accurate reporting or having to retract when information is not accurate. It's no different in the comments section, it doesn't remove free speech it regulates it to create a healthy environment to have a conversation in. Over moderation can have as severe of an effect as under, it has to be a system that takes in common complaints from both sides. Not the hate speech side per say but the sides of people who are pro free flowing conversation and those who want more shielding to avoid extremist echo chambers.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	There should be a strict comment management system in place, someone has to supervise it and react (and possibly penalise) to users spreading hate speech. The comments should not be anonymous since people feel more inclined to be hostile when hiding under a pseudonym. Maybe asking to verify your identity before posting a comment would make people think more before spreading hate.
__label__noRel	This would require a special team to supervise the comment section at all times which might be costly.	I've gone over most opinions on this topic. The best solution would be a bot that would filter out the harmful comments
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	According to newsy.com, between January and March 2022, Meta took action on more than 15 million pieces of hate speech content on Facebook. Roughly 95% of that was detected proactively by Facebook with the help of AI - https://www.newsy.com/stories/artificial-intelligence-is-used-to-track-down-hate-speech/#:~:text=Between%20January%20and%20March%202022,themes%20fall%20through%20the%20cracks.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	Hate speech must be banned totally from the online publications.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	i agree that people have the right to express their own ideas but you have to be considerate otherwise it can easily be interpreted as hate if your not careful with wordings.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	educate young people on online politeness for want of a better word word have meaning and consequences in the real world and individuals have to take responsibility and not hide behind keyboards
__label__noRel	I dont agree with this as sure it counters the hate speech but that makes me question the reliability of the news article	Hate speech is not a criticsm and should be avoided
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	This article describes how censoring might lead users to leave platforms and join other platforms with lighter censoring rules https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/global-extremes/does-censoring-radical-right-social-media-work/
__label__noRel	It is important that views are challenged and there is a forum to do that in	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	I believe those algorithms are not programmed to dealing with hate speech. Otherwise, social media would not be as toxic and emotionally as it is	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__noRel	I suppose the problem here is what a person says is their version of "free speech" could easily be seen in a different context by a reader. It's a very difficult issue to get right.	I think that the introduction of moderators to remove any hate speech would be beneficial. Perhaps the introduction of guidelines as to what constitutes permitted negative comments.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	The only possible way to reduce hate speech is to have some kind of algorithm that may recognise certain words and phrases. Other than that it would mean moderating the comment section.
__label__noRel	AI is a great option that would reduce the need for manpower and increase the efficiency and speed in which hate speech is addressed.	The is no need to moderate comments they must be dished out raw as they are writen by the readers
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	people who comment hate speech should be banned
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	I think that definition of hatespeech needs to be laid out clearly as I think different people have different ideas on what constitutes hatespeech - perhaps if there was a kind of premediation that informs the user that what they are engaging in qualifies as hatespeech it may make them more likely to reconsider their messages introducing a form of self moderation as well as external moderation
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	block swearing, abusive, discrimatory words- freedom of speech without rasicism, name calling etc
__label__noRel	I disagree. Removing the comments section is limiting access to echo chambers, quite literally.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__noRel	I agree. Freedom of speech must not be quashed. There should be much closer monitoring of comments and removal of hateful/abusive ones.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.

__label__noRel	This is more than just censoring	The power of newspapers is too strong and needs to be restricted , moderation of the comments section is needed linked with non anonymous posting of mcomments
__label__noRel	A legal framework is needed to ensure that media outlets don't censor speech on the basis that it is opposite to their views, with the justification that it was hate speech.	It may be a good idea to involve some form of moderators to check if there are any hate speeches. Aggressive comments may be censored accordingly. However, we need to be careful in doing this as some may have negative effect as silencing voices.
__label__noRel	This sounds like a very expensive solution - I think maybe more time and money should be spent on algorithms that can do the same thing	ithink the best thing to do is to not have comments as that can really alter someone elses perception. Especially in this day and age people tend to rely on comments to then pass their own judgement and that can cause hate speech. However if the comments were to still be present i think an idea would be to mute comments that incite any type of hate.
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	Have human and AI to verify potential hateful speech. Given our current resources we should be able to allocate a human check given the rating of the flag by the AI
__label__noRel	I tend to agree with this. In this way editors have a close look to what opinion can be published and which one entails hate speech.	Freedom of speech can be used as catch-all term to justify the use and propagation of bigoted and hateful language. If we accept that some language is not acceptable due to it's clearly hateful nature then we have to acknowledge that some form of censorship of those particular instances has to occur. I would suggest that eliminating all such spaces from newspaper websites would have a massive detrimental effect on valid, non-bigoted, freedom of speech a cornerstone of western life. We don't ban all cars because some people speed dangerously, we monitor the roads and ban the bad drivers. I suggest that as long as readers comments are monitored continually they should remain.

__label__noRel	The idea of using AI algorithms to combat hate speech is an attractive one. However, using experience of Facebook, it's clear that AI systems are still not advanced enough to undertake this task without human oversight. Facebook often censors posts or comments unfairly because its AI algorithms doesn't understand the context. In short, I don't believe we can get away without using humans to check the flagged comments at least.	There could also be a disclaimer added before one can see other comments which encourage readers to fact-check and be mindful of what they're reading, while also having moderators.

__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I believe it is fair for hate speech comments to be censored, because it could lead to violent public behavior. (read this: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech)	People tend to comment just to rile others up, which means it will be a lot of work to moderate. Perhaps an all or nothing approach is best.
__label__noRel	I think the whole concept of hate speech is nonsense and completely hypocritical.	Nowadays with the amount of social media platforms that are available newspapers don't hold as much power. We get all of our news through the spreading of news in social media as seen in this article : https://kettlemag.co.uk/social-media-versus-print-media/
__label__noRel	Agreed people may be highly less likely to post negative comments if they had their true identity in display!	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	Yes, I think that readers can also downvote a comment or flag it so that it can be brought to the moderator's attention and they should take action within a specified time frame.	I have read through some of the cooments and my stance is still the same. It is no doubt that hate speech is a problem, however, not allowing the public the opportunity to comment on issues may not only be a problem against freedom of speech, it may also cause the newspaper to lose some of its loyal readers if they're not able to engage with the content shared by the newspaper.
__label__noRel	yes, the lack of consequences is the problem. We can see from somewhere like facebook where peoples info is so easy to find that people have had negative consequences over their hateful posts so clearly being able to link back the comment to the person can help	I also believe that a filter or having a group of moderators constantly filtering out the negative - hate speech would be beneficial. Similar to other social media platforms, users of the platform perhaps should be allowed to flag or report comments that aren't appropriate,and then a moderator should check the report and take the steps necessary to make the platform a safe space.
__label__noRel	I agree	It can be done by using algorithms
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	While freedom of speech is a human right, it is imperative to be cognizant of the fact that each and every person has the right to have their rights respected. It is for this reason that readers comments cannot be removed. Everyone has the right to make a comment and we do not necessarily always have to agree, we always have to respect. A system can be put in place to remove any vulgar language.
__label__noRel	I would imagine that it would be difficult to filter out all of the hate speech	I believe the comment section should be open to all to express their opinions.We need freedom of speech. Hate speech can be ignored. But it is important to show the view of all.

__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	I don't think any attempts should be made to block or censor anything. Yes I,m Gen X, yes I gre up with the old adage "sticks and stones make break my bones but words will never touch me" . It aint true, but its a good way to live your life.
__label__noRel	The problem is hate speech really means political speech. It's a way of silencing dissent of political agendas that are transforming certain countries societies in a way people don't like.	I have already said that people who have already displayed hate speech on a website should be banned from giving their opinion.
__label__noRel	I dont agree with this as sure it counters the hate speech but that makes me question the reliability of the news article	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I appreciate that everyone has the right to freedom of speech but at the expense of others and being hateful?	In as much as we would like to shy away from it, it is inevitable that people will have something negative to say. It is up to the developers of the website to filter through comments or at least set an approval time for each post.

__label__noRel	covering both sides is great but we should be able to be respectful towards eachother	using key words and having moderators might help
__label__noRel	This is very true and likely	I feel that people should be allowed to have freedom of expression online but should be held accountable for vitriolic and unbased hate speech, this could be achieved by proving identity and by using citations and references when posting online
__label__noRel	It also promotes cyberbullying ,saying it is a free speech.	hate speech online will always be there and we shouldn't focus on hate speech a lo because there will be a lot of positive comments
__label__noRel	Other comments can also make other people sad	Moderating is good and maybe informing the person why their message was moderated so that they know and do better next time
__label__noRel	I agree with this as it reflects my own view. Moderation is the way to go and not removal	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	Overall I think I agree with some of the mentions that removing the comments section does reduce freedom of speech. We should be allowed to comment and share opinions on any topic as long as it isn't hate speech.
__label__noRel	Sometimes being harsh can be kind to the person who may not realise what they're doing.	I enjoy reading through comments and I don't think that they should be removed, but there should be a lot more monitoring going on to remove any hateful ones as soon as they are posted.
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	The author of the post can moderate all comments before allowing them on the page. This does present the issue that only the author's views will be portrayed
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	I don't think it's fair to eliminate comments from newspaper articles because the public is entitled to have their opinions heard. The best way to deal with hate speech is to moderate each comment before it is posted. Also the newspaper could ban accounts who engage in hate speech in the comments section. This moderation could be done through both human moderators and software to find trigger words signifying hate speech. It's important to democracy that citizens can have their say on the issues that affect their lives.

__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	Newspaper websites should use human or artificial intelligence-based moderators who can impartially identify hate speech and remove it from their platforms without removing or censoring genuine, constructive comments and perspectives. If AI is used, certain terms and phrases can be added to a database and comments containing them flagged for moderation to remove hate speech fairly.
__label__noRel	The way to circumvent abuse of flagging is to create consequences for it.

__label__noRel	IT is absoluety the websites job to police polirising comments if nesccearry to keep peace wihthin the outiside community viewing their newspapers.	While censoring certain words in the context of a comment would help reduce hate speech, an issue that would need to be considered is the use of images used as hate speech. Some "memes" can contain hate speech to the AI may misinterpret this as a regular image while the image could be posted as hate speech. An example of this is when people on Reddit use images as "memes" containing racism and sometimes the bot does not flag it as racism. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230

__label__noRel	I think the only way to stop this would be to review all comments before they are published and delete anything that is hate speech.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	people with positive comments won't be able to share	most people seem to be of the opinion that cutting comments altogether is not constructive. A good point was made by an individual that viewing opinions from people you like only doesn't help you to grow (echo chamber).
__label__noRel	would authors be held to account still?	Where is the evidence for this? There is no guarantee that people will give correct credentials. Also, who defines 'hate speech'? This is not as simple as you may believe.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Regulation of the newspaper comment section should be done. There should be moderators who have the ability to remove certain comments if they feel it is needed.
__label__noRel	Posistive for who? One of the reasons for comment section is to promote socialising amongst readers not just or the newspaper itself	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	I think that the idea of users submitting personal data before making a comment can have positive and negative effects - positive in the sense that the user may think twice before posting hate speech and that they can be tracked down and educated; negative in the sense that the user could be on a website that wants to use user's personal data for the wrong reasons. I am still of the view that comments with hate speech need to be filtered out because each individual needs to be responsible in their speech.
__label__noRel	This would be really hard to put into practice. I believe people should have the freedom to remain anonymous as long as they are respecful of others.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	There is no place for hate speech in today's society for hate speech. It is harmful and in some cases, illegal.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	Alternatively I'd offer the opinion that goes against the question and states that we shouldn't offer a space for readers comments (and thus hate speech) at all on news since it's primarily a site and source for news. Systems like https://ground.news/ have been providing news and removing bias without a social aspect already and since third party social/sharing/commentary sites handle discussion and the problem of hate speech far better than newspaper websites presumably can hope to, the solution seems intuitive: remove it and let that happen organically on other websites and platforms.
__label__noRel	I also agree this is a good solution	hate speech is a reflection of two sides of a story ,all side of the story need to be published to allow the public to make up their own minds .
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Allow others users to rate the comments and block those who receive bad ratings
__label__noRel	I agree slightly, it is good to see what others think unfiltered.	By implimenting a system that can filter out all comments before the comments are added to the website or newspaper for the readers to read
__label__noRel	The law! People break the law through hate speech, so the law needs to be the judge.	There should be repercussions to extensive hate speech e.g a limited ban to the forum etc. Use moderators and ensure that users understand the consequences of hate speech commente
__label__noRel	Most readers don't know that comments are turned off https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__noRel	I absolutely agree, everyone should be able to express how they feel however shouldn't do so at the expense of others.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__noRel	By eliminating readers comments, the readers will not be allowed to give their opinion on the topic, which infringes free-speech.	hate speech revolves around certain words or slurs so if those word can be banned or even not allowed and the comment does not show up on the actual site it will help curb hate speech
__label__noRel	I agree with this point. Hate speech just spreads more hate among people.	Hate speech will forever be a problem in society and its up to the newspapers website to make sure they publish newsworthy news that even if they come across negative comments, they know that on their side their story is true and there a no loopholes
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	Some hate speech is actually illegal, so that should definitely be reported and removed. https://www.report-it.org.uk/reporting_internet_hate_crime
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	It goes further than this. We live in a society that has a lot of cry babies. We need to be impervious to negative comments from strangers on a social platform and that is anonymous. Most people need to grow a pair, develop a spine or stop being cry babies. Once this is achieved you will see that any contribution you make to a discussion will be debated in a civilized manner.
__label__noRel	It is very hard to control every comment on these platforms and make sure that everything has been verified but if we want a place to be regarded as accurate and credible we need to find a way to make sure that fringe groups do not use these comment spaces as a place to spread further misinformation and discriminatory language.	agree with not deleting comments, we should live it open and just regulated
__label__noRel	We should try and make the internet a more welcoming place.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	In today's world where technology has advanced to such a degree, I'm of the belief that creating parameters that protect individuals from any form of hate speech is very much possible through things such as AI. The removing of commenting sections could be argued as a violation to one's freedom of speech, it also means the views and opinions of the public will be lost which could have detrimental effects.
__label__noRel	The whole point of comment sections is so that people can provide their opinion on what they've seen/read, stopping this only minimizes debate and being able to view differing opinions. This then leads to break off groups choosing to use other platforms and thus having platforms with polar opinions which can be dangerous as people could be exposed to only one viewpoint	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	That's a very good point and thanks for pointing out what it's called. I learned something new today! I have seen countless times in anti (fill in blank) groups that use asterisks and other characters to write out otherwise blocked words. They get around the system.	you must run a bot system that will automatically detect and remove posts with mature language
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	The website must have words that are automatically marked as unacceptable. whenever those words are included in a comment, the website must privately warn the sender and not allow the comment to go through until the comment is rephrased correctly and politely.
__label__noRel	Having comments has shown that readers engage more in the argument https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	Abuse and hate speech shouldn't be tolerated	Readers should be able to comment but be informed of certain comments that would be considered hate speech. If they are aware and still choose to comment hateful words, the newspaper website should feel comfortable enough to remove those comments since the reader was informed that comments like those would not be acceptable.
__label__noRel	Education only goes so far - some people will just ignore this policy. Perhaps just removing hate speech manually, or having a review process so only non-hate speech comments are published may be better.	Filter comments or have a ban on words that come across as hateful.
__label__noRel	It risks depressing people	People can express them selves however they like but they must be mindful to their language.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	ithink the best thing to do is to not have comments as that can really alter someone elses perception. Especially in this day and age people tend to rely on comments to then pass their own judgement and that can cause hate speech. However if the comments were to still be present i think an idea would be to mute comments that incite any type of hate.

__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform.

It assists readers by giving them a broader sense and understanding of the topic being discussed. Removing them would be taking a way an integral part of that experience.

Comments should be regulated, but comment space should not be removed.
__label__noRel	So because of some people acting like idiots, no one can express their opinion??	I agree with most of the commenters here, there needs to be moderation. Even if you don't agree with the arguments there are ways of saying it that do not fall into 'hate speech'.
__label__noRel	The level at which data can be tracked/who this data gets given to could cause repercussions of privacy especially with things like GDPR	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.

__label__noRel	while free speech is our right and we are entitled to our own opinions, when you are promoting/endorsing hatred and discrimination of any sort, the line should be drawn. having a discussion/debate with opposing sides is normal and gives insight to both sides with little bias, but that cannot be used as an excuse to be hateful or discriminatory.	Overall I think I agree with some of the mentions that removing the comments section does reduce freedom of speech. We should be allowed to comment and share opinions on any topic as long as it isn't hate speech.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__noRel	re-education will not help some people	Reduce the anonymity that hate-speech writers can hide behind - without that shield some may be less inclined to post because it can be traced back to them
__label__noRel	Education is k ey!	by not allowing certain words to be used in the comments space
__label__noRel	There needs to be a strict line between 'Free speech' and 'Hate speech'.	There should be no comment area in order to limit hate speech. Newspapers should be one-sided sources of information.
__label__noRel	Moderators have biases as well which could result in a censorship of differing opinions that do not qualify as hate speech.	As much as it might seem an attempt to constrict expression of thought, I agree comments should no longer be allowed. It always turns into argument and insult. We already know that for every opinion someone else will take the opposite view. A newspaper's view is its own, so let's keep it that way - we already know which way they lean politically. Keep opinions to social media and let people thrash it out there.
__label__noRel	the cons at the moment of the comments with the public are that they are not checked for swearing, name calling etc	i agree that removing comments about hate speech is not the way to go
__label__noRel	hate speech doesnt allways include certain hateful word so wont work in all cases	I found this really interesting, "Khan said the freedom of opinion and expression, including the right to seek, receive and disseminate diverse sources of information, must be upheld by States in times of crises and armed conflict as a precious ‘survival right’ on which people’s lives, health, safety, security and dignity depend." This is similar to what lots of people have been saying regarding worrying that this sort of censorhip could overextend. (https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/10/protect-freedom-expression-vital-survival-right-civilians-armed-conflict-un)
__label__noRel	I totally agree with this statement.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	I think we could have a hold on comments until it is checked and fact checked by a panel of people! Not just one person making the decision. Also I think if there were stricter punishments for hate speech the newspaper would make the person and newspaper think twice.
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	I agree with FransescoT online forums can be a wonderful community but hate speech with faceless people can ruin it. If you want to comment there should be some accountability.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	Newspaper websites should use human or artificial intelligence-based moderators who can impartially identify hate speech and remove it from their platforms without removing or censoring genuine, constructive comments and perspectives. If AI is used, certain terms and phrases can be added to a database and comments containing them flagged for moderation to remove hate speech fairly.
__label__noRel	I think that this is correct but mst places have a law or legal guideline as to what it considered hatespeech n that country	There can be a filtering system that filters hate speech
__label__noRel	I agrre with this	The newspaper website platform owners should be held accountable for any hate speech that occurs on their website and they can combat hate speech allowing fellow readers to be able to flag/report posts that they deem hateful.The moderators can then investigate.
__label__noRel	Moderators are the best way to monitor the content commented combined with a system that flags censored words	I think if all comments go under review for hate speech, that should still allow a chance for hate speech comments to be retracted
__label__noRel	I agree	i believe comment are important, to allow people to discuss. sometimes you can get factual information from other people comments
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	Addressing hate speech does not mean limiting or prohibiting freedom of speech. It means keeping hate speech from escalating into something more dangerous, particularly incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence, which is prohibited under international law. https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	you should autoban key hate speech words
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	People will always spew hate speech and regulating it may be difficult to do. Freedom of speech should prevail therefore eliminating the comments section would be wrong. The newspaper site may have an automation that identifies hate words and whenever these appear the comment should be hidden from the comments section.
__label__noRel	this would be a good start, i think that having a moderator would help to eliminate hate speech	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	In principle a great idea, in practice this requires more money be spent on moderators and system updates	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	The problem with this is that the moderator themselves often have an agenda.

__label__noRel	I actually agree that eliminating the space for conversation on polarizing topics can reduce extremist echo chambers sometimes. Though they often move to other platforms that have zero regulations to hold that conversation when they can't have it where they saw something. Which increases the odds of being stuck in a hateful echo chamber.	Increasing the monitoring of comments made on a post will prevent the propagation of dangerous viewpoints and scams performed on people as no control over the content published create spaces for this to take place.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	Definitely true.	I believe the following article could provide more information on hate speech, not only in the context of this discussion but as a whole and what can be done to combat it. https://www.stompoutbullying.org/blog/hate-speech
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	By having an administrator who is able to monitor any comment posted, and removing hateful speech and giving warning to hateful viewers
__label__noRel	that could also be helpful	By educating people that not everything written in newspapers is true, they should egnore some information
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	Freedpn of speech doesnt mean you must promote hate speech on newspapers, it basically means you free to voice out your concerns in around society in a more respectfull manner.
__label__noRel	Also it's not about restricting any form of hate speech, we also need to be reminded that our opinions can't be the only right one. Hate speech is hate, and a crime against who ever is being undermined	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	I think an AI could be very useful as well because it would take emotion out of equation when reaching decisions about what speech should be weeded out.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button	I think this is a task that is hard to do because it has to be done in a way that would not hinder freedom of speech but at the same time not attack people. Thus, I think comments should be flagged depending on the words used but not be deleted until it has been checked.
__label__noRel	This leaves space for people to bully and be toxic without any consequences	I think people should be encouraged to give personal comments however they need to be monitored to ensure hate speech cannot be seen which might negatively impact others
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	There should be moderators of the discussion, people who use hate speech should be informed of what is problematic about their comments, comments should be deleted or they might be hidden but you can open them and read the moderators comments. If educating is not helping after first attempt, person should be restrcited form further discussion.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	While censoring certain words in the context of a comment would help reduce hate speech, an issue that would need to be considered is the use of images used as hate speech. Some "memes" can contain hate speech to the AI may misinterpret this as a regular image while the image could be posted as hate speech. An example of this is when people on Reddit use images as "memes" containing racism and sometimes the bot does not flag it as racism. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	I think allowing some special space to allow it also would be helpful instead of cutting comments off.
__label__noRel	However some people might argue that what they said is not hate speech, and that the newspaper is trying to censor their opinion	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	I agree. This could prevent uninformed comments which usually lead to hate speech.	I agree that the only way to ensure balanced discussion without allowing hate or eliminating genuine responses is through moderation of comments before posting
__label__noRel	I think moderation is key, so do agree!	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	Monitoring and moderating is not enough. It wont solve the problem. Look at this study: https://www.cairn.info/revue-questions-de-communication-2020-2-page-529.htm	After doing some follow up reading from https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/what-is-online-hate-crime/ I have seen how the anonymity of these online comments can be what makes it so easy for people to be hateful. Therefore, an easy solution would be to make it impossible for people to comment anonymously, and have people have to provide personal information. However, I am not sure how this would work from a data protection point of view. It is certainly a start.
__label__noRel	True and in my opinion the right to freedom of speech should trump any counter argument.	There is a careful balance to be made between protecting others from the effects of hate speech and protecting free speech. Online hate speech unfortunately can have the effect of increasing violence against minorities (https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons) but blocking all free speech because of the actions of a few seems like a poor decision. More must be done to remove hate speech online quickly and this means spending more money tackling it.
__label__noRel	It is possible to use evidence based methods to apply this type of solution, then its a question of automationon	In a survey of news sites it was found that on average 11% of comments are removed...some of these are because they are spam and some because they are offensive. I think that the fact that it's more than one in two really shows how necessary moderation is, these issues are so common. Source: https://netino.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/WAN-IFRA_Online_Commenting.pdf (pg 7)
__label__noRel	I agree with Richard in so far as newspapers to this point mostly haven't had very successful moderating systems. Either they are unaware of current methods of spreading misinformation or they bring down the ban hammer so quickly that it makes their comments confusing	I have already said that people who have already displayed hate speech on a website should be banned from giving their opinion.
__label__noRel	surely this should be the job of the editor to make sure the journalists are impartial	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	Thank you! Some hate is seriously not necessary	I think you can put a price to the website- a subscription to readers.
__label__noRel	In addition to using algorithms, technology can be used to eliminate comments that involve hate speech for reader inclusivity. I definitely agree to this. Everyone has a freedom of speech, but it should infringe the rights of others too.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	Becauce we are different as peole we find some views offensive	Some people will always use hate speech and hide behind their computer, There needs to be some sort of filter added to flag such comments and people and a ban put on the user
__label__noRel	Moderators are the best way to monitor the content commented combined with a system that flags censored words	you can add an AI system in the website that will scan all comments instantly after they have been posted and it can remove any hate speech before it is seen by many people on the comment section, this method is used by some online communication platforms.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	we cannot remove reviewer comments altogether. i believe a method to filter or censored hate speech is necessary.	Short answer is you can't, as the term 'hate speech' is incredibly vague, and can differ from person to person.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	newspapers are unlikely to policy it as no publicity is bad publicity to them. the more engagements they get, the better.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	A rounded view of a topic. Ensure that their is a balanced opinion around newspapers. And also offers a check and balance--the public opinion is heard and known around issue raised.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	The best way to curb hate speech would be to have the comments section moderated for any forms of hate speech. In this manner people who have an opinion with substance can have a say in whatever article that was published.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	There should be serious repercussions against hate speech
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I agree	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	This closes the possibility of healthy debate and non-hate speech.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	I believe that people are allowed to express their opinions , that is why we have freedom of speech. However with that right, we are not subjected to hate speech, there are so many ways of expressing yourself without using offensive or hateful words. Considering a newspaper is a public platform, I believe everyone should try to be respective at all times. The comment space must not be removed, it helps to get insights of readers and is very helpful. I think the website should be enhanced in a way that it detects offensive language and doesn't allow the reader to continue if they use such. Also, comments should be monitored before being posted to the public.
__label__noRel	I agree	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	The newspaper should also boost positive messages of tolerance.	Is it actually their responsibilty?
__label__noRel	A team of moderators would have their own bias so it is not possible to know what is really hate speech.	news media can look into AI technology to solve such problems.the machine will detect faul speeach and instantly hide or delete the comment ,then send a warning to the post writer
__label__noRel	I agree that hate speech can never be completely eliminated	It is important that people are able to have a voice, especially as it can be a great tool in educating people, and giving people a variety of viewpoints that they wouldn't necessarily get to often hear. Sometimes we learn best by hearing and understanding the views of other people. We don't have to necessarily change our opinions, but it can help us become more aware of why or how people feel a certain way about things.
__label__noRel	Removing hate speech is not the same as removing the ability for everyone to present their opinion : https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	Removing the comment section should not be an option, we should not lose the right to freedom of speech based on the likelihood that a few may post hateful comments, strict moderation and being able to report hate speech is the solution. Having people sign up for platforms and use ID to which they could be held personally accountable is an option as well. Hate Speech often comes from being able to hide behind a keyboard, screen and a fake username.
__label__noRel	upholds freedom of speech	Debate should be available upon all topics. To reduce this availability reduces the opportunities for people to express their opinions and undermines democratic processes. Hate speech should be managed and eliminated before publication.
__label__noRel	I agree	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	There needs to be rules and regulations stating the type of comments that can be made about other people. There should also be verification of a persons identity everytime they make a comment so that is visible who the statement was made by. Newspaper articles should constantly ready and delete hate speech comment.
__label__noRel	I agree	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	Advanced AI is the ultimate answer. It is the cheapest and most unbiased moderator option.
__label__noRel	Someone has had to code that algorithm so it is already bias. Comments need a team of diverse moderators	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	Removing comment sections on newspapers, enables limited misinformation and discrimination to reproduce.	Asking for their constructive criticism and how it will benefit the individual and community.
__label__noRel	I agree	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	Be more strict when allowing people to create profiles, that require identification before allowing anybody to comment. If they choose to be anonymous do not allow them to comment.
__label__noRel	I disagree, try to read everyone's idea. Some are feasible and doable	Our freedom to do anything as part of a society is limited. Thus freedom of speech should be no different. Poeple need to be held accountable for their mistakes, so everybody else's rights will be protected. So having a set of keywords which are not allowed to be used is a way of reminding the writter that using the offensive word he/she is trying to use is considered a crime. An additional way to handle that is having the flag option by users and a team of moderators who follow a standard and will verify if flagged comments should be maintained or not. Lastly, anonymity might bring a feeling of impunity and even its possibility, so a way to avoid that is allowing one profile per person/email, where a fake username can be set, but, in the backstage, the website will know who it is that wrote each comment.
__label__noRel	Surely it is possible to have a free exchange of ideas without resorting to hate speech. There must be a level of basic human respect that can be maintained.	As I saw some commentary on this platform, my opinion is that we need 2 things. A submission of personal data before one can have access to post anything related and real time moderation of the comments. Big platforms like YouTube, Instagram and others are held accountable for their users' actions and they have had a lot of success so far. Source: https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/combat-online-hate-speech/
__label__noRel	I disagree because it is still tolerating that intolerant people express themselves and make their opinions visible. Even if they are removed,it will take a while for that to happen and this hateful message may have already found an echo in another bigot.	we should keep comment sections on newspaper websites but we should have moderators to filter out any hate speech
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	Freedom of speech comes with a responsibilty, and if people are not responsible with their rights, there should be measures put into place to fix that	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	And we will get to keep our respectful viewers who knows that you still have disagreement without insulting others	modrate what can be posted before it allowed to be published finally
__label__noRel	the website could give raise this this awareness and have a open discusion	Readers that feel the need to put hate speech in comment section only do so because of the way they can remain anonymous online. In everyday life you could go months and if not years without hearing hate speech, whilst it can almost be a daily occurrence when browsing online in various forums, social media platforms or comment sections on news websites. Finding a way for readers/users not to remain anonymous and having real consequences for spreading hate speech would reduce this issue.
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	I agree with the point of view that there should be a broad spectrum of moderators to stop any particular biased opinion or agenda from controlling the comments.
__label__noRel	I agree	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	Saves having a human moderator soft through hundreds of comments.	The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is often used as a reason not to have readers comments. It seems that this is not a fair argument for eliminating readers comments because of the psychological phenomenon of "cognitive dissonance" - we automatically search for echo chambers in any context.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__noRel	If people aren’t made aware of issues relating to hate speech, there may not be enough awareness to create a change	Just allow people to report bad comments and when it gets to a certain number it should delete the message and send an automatic email to the person who wrote it with a warning.
__label__noRel	word filters can be circumvented, for example by replacing one or more letters with a number or asterisk. The filter would not remove the offensive word but it would still be clear to readers what word was being used.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	Cannot guarantee 100% data protection.	Is it necessary to have readers comments? What do they add to the article?
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	Have monitoring software be used. The comment section should not be removed, because it then deprives the general public of their opinion and freedom of speech as well as addressing any inaccuracies that were mentioned in articles.
__label__noRel	This is true, moreover as it is said in this article https://medium.com/@flytedesk/the-pros-and-cons-of-removing-a-website-comment-section-9bea62f8e42b, removing a comment section might be thought by some users as a going against free speech and they will also spend less time on the website, leading to worse performances of the brand/website.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	Through active moderation.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	I think an AI that could identify some keyword related with hate speech would be helpful to flag that comment and allow further review
__label__noRel	Even if it is moderated, who is to say that the moderator is unbiased and won't let some comments through even though they contain hate soeech	The pros of removing comment sections would be to eradicate the spreadof hate speech. Certain individuals thrive on adding fuel to fire. In this case having the comment section deleted would be a positive thing. On the other hand only by having differing opinions can discussions and debates happen. So if someone spews hate speech only then can we see the extent to which someone disagrees with a certain group/viewpoint etc. https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea
__label__noRel	I agree with the main idea, but people who spew hate speech aren't exactly open to being educated.	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	Verification of identity is a useful suggestion as users may be more scared of consequences if they can be identified from their comments.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.

__label__noRel	I agree with this. The trick is how to select unbiased moderators. They have to go by a guideline	Use technology to monitor and block users

__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Hate speech must be banned totally from the online publications.
__label__noRel	I used to moderate a forum. The administrator set up various parameters for keyword triggers. There would be a lot of spurious reports due to poor spelling or grammar use - for example you would get a post flagged up for mentioning the word "hoe" however from the entire sentence it was clear they actually mistyped "home" - the system is not foolproof.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	i believe comment are important, to allow people to discuss. sometimes you can get factual information from other people comments
__label__noRel	i agree, this would be useful as it can keep other comments	At the end of the day hate speech is not hate speech to everyone, I ended up reaching the conclusion that everyone has their own opinion about everything, So to want to filter or block comments is not freedom of speech, but building a sensitive society that is scared of debates and confronting serious issues, Its up to the receiver of the comment to act on it or not. Cyber bullying is a different story.
__label__noRel	giving those you always provide hate speech anonymously gives them the upper hand with gettong away with it. It makes it easier for them to do it over and over again	Having moderators remove hateful speech and providing better education.

__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	A possible way to address hate speech on newspaper sites would be to incorporate both human moderators and some sort of AI that monitors for hateful words and comments. The requirement to submit personally identifying information before commenting might also help because without this then anyone can create a fake name that hides the person's true identity so therefore more likely to engage in hate speech. If personal information is required, then hate speech would be less likely.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	Agreeing with others here: a standard of moderation would have to be communicated to the user, with straightforward policies of flagging or reporting potentially hateful comments. A synthesis of live and algorithmic moderators might be best, as certain words can be auto-flagged for review, whereas other things might involve a more delicate touch.
__label__noRel	Having an algorithm do the work will inevitably lead to false positives and will also lead to culprits re-tooling their speech to skirt around the algorithm's 'rules'.

__label__noRel	That is actually a good idea, but gives a lot of power to the moderators.	There should be some level of censoring to eliminate hate speech, but not to the extent where comments are totally disabled

__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	It is important for people to voice their opions so I do not thik this discussion is fair, however I do agree that comments should be moderated. The readers should also be made aware of the rules that apply to commenting with regards to hateful speech.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it.

I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	I think that the idea of users submitting personal data before making a comment can have positive and negative effects - positive in the sense that the user may think twice before posting hate speech and that they can be tracked down and educated; negative in the sense that the user could be on a website that wants to use user's personal data for the wrong reasons. I am still of the view that comments with hate speech need to be filtered out because each individual needs to be responsible in their speech.
__label__noRel	I agree that limiting freedom of speech is not the solution. The algorithm should be able to pick up certain words/phrases that can then filter the hate speech.	This is right.

I don't think newspapers, who have already seen their takings plummet in recent years due to everything moving online, will want to pay to employ moderators for their articles.

They would need to have a pretty high number of mods in order to keep up as each newspaper carries so many articles. This topic is a massive minefield and I don't think there is a simple solution to it.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	free speech doesn't give you the right to harass other peop le	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information.

__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way.

__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	I think one way of eliminating hate speech is to filter the comment section by certain words that are considered hateful. We obviously can not control what people do but by filtering the comment section we can limit what people can and can not say.
__label__noRel	I think it is a good idea to be able to flag the comment so moderators can review it	Censoring speech prevents progress as a soceity. (https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2016/04/free-speech-important/)
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	With rights comes responsibility. We all have freedom of speech but it is our responsibility to ensure that our speech does not cause harm on others. If people do not want to be responsible in their speech, then their speech should be reduced because things have consequences. So, the hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by removing comments with hate speech or having a software that can identify hate speech in a comment before it is posted.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	this could be done by filtering terms	I agree with the point of view that there should be a broad spectrum of moderators to stop any particular biased opinion or agenda from controlling the comments.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	ALthough the idea of free speech is important, it cannot be used as an excuse to upset others and use racist/sexist/ violent language.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.

I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	newspapers are biased - they don't reflect balanced opinions	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy

I believe the following article could provide more information on hate speech, not only in the context of this discussion but as a whole and what can be done to combat it. https://www.stompoutbullying.org/blog/hate-speech
__label__noRel	I believe that punishment would cause more polarization because people may have more negative feelings towards newspaper websites with comments sections. Like what AllisonK said, education is a better preventative measure. If punishment is necessary, it should involve education that the commentator actively engages in.	Free speech is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it is necessary for an effective democratic society and on the other hand, people tend to abuse the right. Newspapers and publishing companies are major symbols of free speech, however, and there will always be disadvantages to be endured, hate speech inclusive. The solution is not to disable comment spaces but to continually implore and push for cooperation amongst readers.
__label__noRel	Regulations fail, and extremists will point to any minor failing as strong proof of their firmly held beliefs.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it.

__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	Hate speech can be positive criticism and essential in some posts, altgough it can be offensive and totally uncalled for in other posts.

__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	I would not eliminate the hate speech right away but rather alarm the user and ask them to refrain from that kind of speech or ask them to elaborate or explain the reasons for the anger. Maybe as a moderator I would try to understand their viewpoint because by removing the speech there will be just more anger and hatred.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	The problem is that hate speech can esculate and end up working against the newspaper's interest. People don't want to spend time in a fully toxic environment.	we can do that by having strict rules on language and hate speech where one can be blocked from commenting or their comments gets removed if there is any negativity
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	I think this is a task that is hard to do because it has to be done in a way that would not hinder freedom of speech but at the same time not attack people. Thus, I think comments should be flagged depending on the words used but not be deleted until it has been checked.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	Freedom of speech can be used as catch-all term to justify the use and propagation of bigoted and hateful language. If we accept that some language is not acceptable due to it's clearly hateful nature then we have to acknowledge that some form of censorship of those particular instances has to occur. I would suggest that eliminating all such spaces from newspaper websites would have a massive detrimental effect on valid, non-bigoted, freedom of speech a cornerstone of western life. We don't ban all cars because some people speed dangerously, we monitor the roads and ban the bad drivers. I suggest that as long as readers comments are monitored continually they should remain.
__label__noRel	i like this idea and it allows the reader to rethink what they have wrote instead of it being taken down	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	I think we could have a hold on comments until it is checked and fact checked by a panel of people! Not just one person making the decision. Also I think if there were stricter punishments for hate speech the newspaper would make the person and newspaper think twice.
__label__noRel	I agree	I'm not sure if it will work but they can put a sign on the website that says no to hate comments allowed. Or a report button can also help then administrator can review the reported comments
__label__noRel	I think in the cases of newspapers, the hateful comments can be removed before print. If it's an online platform then said user can be shadowed	monitor comments before the are posted
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	By having an administrator who is able to monitor any comment posted, and removing hateful speech and giving warning to hateful viewers
__label__noRel	No censoring of opinions	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	By totally eliminating the comments section because most it kills reporters confidence and it may lead to hate speech and fake news

Perhaps newspapers could use similar tools to respondology (https://respondology.com/ ) or hive moderation (https://hivemoderation.com ) that can identify and block hateful speech. This might well work and I think both of these use AI.

There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	comments should be moderated but we cannot remove all the negative and leave the positive comments. it would look like the newspaper is being biased
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Hate speech can be controlled by blacklisting keywords on the search engine of a particular blog post/newspapers which will delete any comments that may contain any of the blacklisted keywords.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Hire moderators and similar positions, and also having filtering systems
__label__noRel	I agree. In most cases people often react out of anger or disappointment, sometimes even without fully comprehending what is being said which I feel is the reason for some hate speech.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	The newspaper website platform owners should be held accountable for any hate speech that occurs on their website and they can combat hate speech allowing fellow readers to be able to flag/report posts that they deem hateful.The moderators can then investigate.

__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	We do have to allow people to express their opinions - we can't pretend opinions don't exist. Having them out in the open lets us know what we're dealing with. But at the same time hate speech can't be allowed to flourish and absolutely needs to be challenged. There is a role for AI (which I have said before I know) to try and weed out and remove anything that is just pure hate and not any sort of coherent argument or opinion.
__label__noRel	I agree, i think several moderators should be put in place to review the comments.	The problem with moderating means that people may have a stance on what counts as a hate comment and may cause differing opinions and deletions of stuff that may just be outside someone's comfort zone https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793

__label__noRel	I believe it is fair for hate speech comments to be censored, because it could lead to violent public behavior. (read this: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech)	Moderation of both users and comments isn't difficult to implement and will weed out the idiots that want to ruin it.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	I think that definition of hatespeech needs to be laid out clearly as I think different people have different ideas on what constitutes hatespeech - perhaps if there was a kind of premediation that informs the user that what they are engaging in qualifies as hatespeech it may make them more likely to reconsider their messages introducing a form of self moderation as well as external moderation
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	the best way is for companies to filter hate speech and remove it as long as the criteria for hate speech comes from an independent organisation. If companies themselves govern what is hate speech then we would become subject to there rules which you would lose the point of freedom of speech. Also there should be more support in the community for people who are being targeted in hate speech attacks.
__label__noRel	I agree with this sentiment as people will be more conscious of their opinions.	The words chosen to be used are very essential when in comes to the reader and a writer. The content that is viewed as a hate speech should not be shown to the other readers. It should automatically give a warning to the writer and after 3 warnings they should be blocked as they do not comply with the terms and conditions.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	the newspapers should have an algorithm that can detect comments which go against the community guidelines and ban these accounts.

__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	I think there should a program that verify the comment before they are displayed on the newpaper
__label__noRel	Removing the comment section will not prevent hate speech from occurring. People will find an alternative online platform, e.g. forums. Instead, companies should focus on moderating the comment section/providing links as to why posts that may be flagged are harmful. We need to focus more on prevention as opposed to reaction.	Community moderation is used on many platforms to allow discussion whilst preventing hate speech from arising, however this is greatly dependent on human participation which can take a lot of work depending on the size of the community. Additionally, the removal of hateful comments can better a comment section, but will not change a commenters views- this has led to the development of more insular online communities fostering these more extreme or hateful views. People will create a space for their commentary if there isn't one provided (or if their comments are removed from somewhere). A lot of this comes down to what a given newspaper wants to be associated with (in the sense of their brand) as opposed to maintaining the sanctity of online discussion.
__label__noRel	This would eliminate inappropriate comments	One way I propose to prevent hate speech is to remove anonymity online. Not being able to hide should limit cowardly behavior and thus reduce harmful speech.

Other people can disagree - they should not allow themselves to be angered by opinions with which they disagree.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	After doing some follow up reading from https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/what-is-online-hate-crime/ I have seen how the anonymity of these online comments can be what makes it so easy for people to be hateful. Therefore, an easy solution would be to make it impossible for people to comment anonymously, and have people have to provide personal information. However, I am not sure how this would work from a data protection point of view. It is certainly a start.
__label__noRel	A very good point. So-called hate speech is often used by leftists to silence political opponents.

The newspaper can post on a platform such as twitter in order to get comments - while disabling comments on their own platform.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	Firtly, i think the newpaper need to acknowledge the concern of hate speech. And is importnant because we can never fully avoid it. So the newspaper should have a platform support people who are targets of hate speech.	I found this really interesting, "Khan said the freedom of opinion and expression, including the right to seek, receive and disseminate diverse sources of information, must be upheld by States in times of crises and armed conflict as a precious ‘survival right’ on which people’s lives, health, safety, security and dignity depend." This is similar to what lots of people have been saying regarding worrying that this sort of censorhip could overextend. (https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/10/protect-freedom-expression-vital-survival-right-civilians-armed-conflict-un)
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	By simply monitoring the comments and blocking the negative ones and removing them
__label__noRel	Moderation can be timely and expensive and then you wouldn't see comments in real time	https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-and-real-harm
__label__noRel	Banning comment section is not a solution at all, the ban of comment sections is also the ban of freedom of speech/ opinions over all. The idea behind comment sections is for readers to share their different thoughts regarding the News with each other which is very important.	I tend to agree that newspapers should provide spaces for dicussion. It encourages people to read about the topic before making comments and peopel can easily reference reference the article in their comments. I think this allows for a more fruitful and productive discussion that on other platforms e.g. social media. However, hate speech is certainly an issue and easily derails conversations. While moderation of hate speech would be ideal, the burden on the newspaper is likely too great to do this manually. Perhaps a mixture of auto-moderation (flagging/removing key words), manual review by the newspaper and some form of community moderation may work well together.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	I agree with the notion that being able to share our thoughts and feelings is a right and having people share their views can help people to question their own thoughts. The inclusion of moderators to prevent people from posting discriminatory or harmful comments would be good, but difficult to ensure these moderators aren't biased towards one argument
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I like this idea, it sounds very fair	I don't think algorithms are the answer. They need to be very, very sophisticated otherwise they require a human mediator.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	making individuals aware	Some people just like to spread their negative vibes on strangers, not worried about serious consequences, as the worst thing that can happen to them is the comment being removed. There should be consequences!
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	Newspapers are read by various demographics and have different types of people from different angles reading different ones, so a comment section does seem like it shouldn't be necessary	It has been shown that comments sections are popular and do drive traffic to websites and make people spend more time on the site (so pleasing advertisers) So from a commercial/publishing point of view it would seem that some kind of moderation is the best way to deal with the problem and not eliminate the section altogether. (See https://webpublisherpro.com/your-website-needs-a-comments-section/)
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	Some feedback is sometimes good for the growth of the newspaper website	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	some words should be muted or not allowed to be used in newspapers, because they are offensive or they contribute to hate speech	I believe comment sections should be moderated more to prevent the obvious hate speech and statements that do not add anything useful to the discussion
__label__noRel	Totally agree with this. Raise awareness of the problem. Talk to friends about why hate speech is not a problem for the internet only but for our societies as well.	rules for discussion could be posted before giving the access, mention that chat moderators are following all discussions and hate speech will be removed if occures.
__label__noRel	But what if the opinion of others infringes upon the rights of another. As much as we should all be able to express our opinion it shouldn't be at the expense of others.	The newspapers should encourage the victims of hate speech to report hate speech published, establish monitoring and evaluation units in newsrooms. Some units should be tasked with monitoring hate speech trends, compiling reports and bringing these to the attention of key institutions
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Allow others users to rate the comments and block those who receive bad ratings
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	I totally agree that hate speech should be limited as some readers do not take it lightly and may harm themselves after reading. I have heard stories about people ending their lives after their stories which often are embarassing are published, and the situation made worse by the comment section.
__label__noRel	The newspapers will not get to know how people realy feel about the issue at hand if the comment space is closed. The dialogue will be one sided	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	I agree with Ian. It has real life consequences. It is important that moderators can identify hate speech, that is not free speech.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	Protected classes can be addressed properly by preferred terms. Reduces fighting over "political" issues instead of the subject at hand	Block known accounts with a history of hate speech
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	Advanced AI is the ultimate answer. It is the cheapest and most unbiased moderator option.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	What about allowing the comment section, but having a built-in screener running in the background, that automatically prevents posts with certain hateful words it is built to detect?
__label__noRel	Newspapers are a valid and beneficial space for comments	I understand that there will always be people saying the comment section needs to stay as we are all allowed free speech.
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	By introducing a cyber bullying detecting software
__label__noRel	yes. good moderators are the key	Like I mentioned previously,the need for artificial intelligence is vital and like what AliceW mentioned in hjer post that people needs to be educated about hate speech which I strongly support.I also think it is everyone's responsibility to educate each other the damage hate speech has to individuals and the society at large
__label__noRel	I like this idea as it contains inbuilt responsibility, so it motivates the people in power to fix it, and competition between different newspapers will breed more effective methods to reduce hate speech effectively, which other platforms will copy and adapt	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	People should be allowed to say what they want. Other people can disagree - they should not allow themselves to be angered by opinions with which they disagree.
__label__noRel	I agree, everybody has freedom of speech and we all have to right to access t information.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	In order for effective moderation to occur, some kind of consensus or clearly reachable policy on what constitutes hate speech (including dogwhistling, which may be less clear to a lay viewer) would need to be in place. This might require too much buy-in from commenters, but is necessary if anything can be consistently enforced.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	I think rather than removing the option to comment/debate below an article, there could be moderators and hate speech buttons and bots to keep hate speech at bay.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	I am reminded while discussing this of the way Daily Mail in UK handles the comments section. It just mentions on top of the comments page that theses comments are not moderated.So it allows everybody to express their opionion. This is how it should be done in my opinion
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	This is not a realistic approach at this time. With the definition of "hate speech" becoming more and more loose and up for interpretation, this sets a dangerous precedent of government and law enforcement overreach. The only time where law enforcement may need to get involved is with blatant calls to violence - physical violence - or inciting hatred against a targeted individual or group. I agree somewhat with this point, but not in the direction things are starting to head in today's times.	It must me a government's responsibility to implement policies against hate speech.https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-to-combat-fake-news-and-disinformation/
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	we can reduce hate speech by blocking out certain words so that it can not be viewed publicly. and blocking the user using hate speech
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	While I agree that it is free speech, just because it's free speech shouldn't mean it should be allowed especially when its there for everyone to see.	by having a system or word check that will not allow users to use words that are considered as hate speech
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	as long as good moderators are in place, hate speech and disrespectful comments will be weeded out.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	Use a BOT to regulate hateful comments
__label__noRel	anyone writing things against the prevailing narrative will be shut down. George Orwell wrote this would happen and women would be the ones easily taken in and become enforcers.	hate speech is a reflection of two sides of a story ,all side of the story need to be published to allow the public to make up their own minds .
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	Having a comments section can be ideal to engage in a healthy debate but will need to monitored very strictly to ensure there is no bullying or one sided views be taken against any individuals
__label__noRel	i believe there is no cons at all	we could filter the comments and have a panel to decide
__label__noRel	Hate speech can unfortunetely bean opinion base within this modern world. Being oversentativie to certain comments can pottentially reduce freedom of speech.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	Hi Fabio, I believe you are absolutely right. Comments should definitely be allowed but under some kind of regulation. Not all comments are useful or relevant.	I think you can put a price to the website- a subscription to readers.
__label__noRel	Rules will need to be put in place to make this work. But I agree it's worthwhile.	Comments should be regulated, but comment space should not be removed.

__label__noRel	I agree this article https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/03/29/the-future-of-free-speech-trolls-anonymity-and-fake-news-online/ speaks about hthis also. Being anon givens comfortability and lets people hide behind a false identity, taking that away would likely reduce hate speech on popular newspaper outlets out of fear of being identified. However, those with these views would likely continue on more far-right news outlets	Identifying users with hate speech and restricting their accounts from using the platform and commenting on it.
__label__noRel	WHile the definition in general can apply to most types of hate speech, there is one flaw, which can be illustrated by the following statement: "I don't care about your race, religion or gender. I do not like you because you are an idiot (or stupid)". Is that hate speech or an expression of opinion?	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	yes this absolutly true, newspapers should not be acting like the censorship police	Provide a clear definition on what is considered hate speech and eliminate those comments that fit in that definition
__label__noRel	we cannot remove reviewer comments altogether. i believe a method to filter or censored hate speech is necessary.	I think that fully blocking comments being allowed is detrimental to free speech, therefore comments should be allowed. However, there should be monitoring and banning of certain individuals if they are found to be continually hateful towards others.
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	As already demonstrated by other bigger social media companies, algorithms often contain and reinforce the negative biases of its creators, so I'm not sure how effective they would be in detecting and filtering out hate speech.
__label__noRel	word filters can be circumvented, for example by replacing one or more letters with a number or asterisk.

__label__noRel	However people who don't feel heard will often go to where they do feel heard. So finding a way to balance the correction of their hateful views while restricting their access for sharing them is the struggle.	I think that moderation is the most effective way of preventing hate speech. Filtering comments would not work as it is difficult to find a algorithm for the context of a comment. Free speech is so important it should not be removed.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	I think all the hate speech my be removed before it is published on public
__label__noRel	I am for moderating as it does not necessarily silence the person but flags that they try to put their point across without using hate speech.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	Right to free speech isn't necessarily a right to a platform or a publisher. Before the internet, people weren't entitled to have their comments on the news stapled inside a copy of the paper. They were just able to express their opinions on it independently, to family or coworkers, or by writing their own publication in response. I'm not sure if newspapers simply choosing not to publish readers' comments (which is what they are doing by hosting those comments on their site) is the same as censoring free speech. By this logic, anyone who writes a poorly written opinion piece and submits it to the New York Times should get it published, because otherwise their speech is oppressed.	I agree that moderating the comment section with flagged phrases that automatically send comments for quick moeration would be a good solution.

__label__noRel	agree	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	allow people to say what they feel
__label__noRel	I like the idea of 'repeat offenders' being noticed if you will. It means people can't abuse the system as easily	I disagree with the stance of doing away with the comment section in its entirety, it goes against the premise of media which is to spark a debate or discussion.
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	Open facts	Is space for readers comment really that necessary? Nowadays, with all other social medias available, the conversation can happen on platform made for dialogue. But as practice shows, those "conversations" are often very polarized and everyone is kind of screaming in a void.
__label__noRel	This would allow discussion while at the same time ensuring a system is in place to reduce harm/offense.	Just allow people to report bad comments and when it gets to a certain number it should delete the message and send an automatic email to the person who wrote it with a warning.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	Ask people to be respectful and back-up their opinions factually. The danger, of course, is attaching URLs or info that themselves propagate misinformation by presenting it as fact.

__label__noRel	Someone needs to be employed to regulate the chat	I think we firstly have to call out hate speech in order for people to learn that it is not okay and unacceptable. The reason being online 'haters' tend to abuse their right to free speech such that it infringes upon the next person because they have the comfort of knowing that nobody will find put who they really are and confront them. By calling out users on the newspaper website and responding to their comment as the moderator of the comments, and actually suspending their accounts because of it can go a long way.
__label__noRel	I agree with this	read though the comments and only put on the comments with the less hate speech on
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	Hate speech can be positive criticism and essential in some posts, altgough it can be offensive and totally uncalled for in other posts. A way in which social media apps regulate and monitor the comments, otherwise people have rights to freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Have a moderator than overlooks all readers comments and makes sure they're all suitable.

Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	This makes great sense!	i believe comment are important, to allow people to discuss. sometimes you can get factual information from other people comments
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	A possible way to address hate speech on newspaper sites would be to incorporate both human moderators and some sort of AI that monitors for hateful words and comments. The requirement to submit personally identifying information before commenting might also help because without this then anyone can create a fake name that hides the person's true identity so therefore more likely to engage in hate speech. If personal information is required, then hate speech would be less likely.
__label__noRel	it says it could be removed, but doesn't guarantee always	Everyone shoould be able to express their own ideas but we could have some kind of protection in words the should not be allowed and also have a way to keep moderators on the website, people could be warned that they are doing something wrong and be explained that there IS NO HATE SPEECH and be offered maybe some way to express herself without hurting or damaging others.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	I agree with the notion that being able to share our thoughts and feelings is a right and having people share their views can help people to question their own thoughts. The inclusion of moderators to prevent people from posting discriminatory or harmful comments would be good, but difficult to ensure these moderators aren't biased towards one argument
__label__noRel	I dissagree, it should be a safe space for everyone.. people have a right to disagree but not use inflammatory hate speech.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	By the whole nature of the newspapers removing this ability, who is to say the newspaper itself could be potentially spreading hate news?
__label__noRel	You may argue that it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police their comment sections. Having said that, perhaps the relevant question you should be asking is whether it is in their best interests to do so. That is, even if it's not their moral obligation, it may STILL be in their financial and functional best interest to do so. The prevalence and salience of hate speech may signal to audiences that the newspaper tolerates (at best) and endorses (at worst) the hateful commentary appearing in their comment section. How do you think this would impact the bottom-line of the bottom line of said newspaper company? I would argue: Not well. And how do you think this would impact the ability of said newspaper to reach future audiences? I would argue: Not well. Individuals disgusted by the appearance of hate speech may be at an increased probability of avoiding said newspaper website in the future on moral grounds. Consider, for example, individuals who boycott Nestle for ethical reasons.	By implimenting a system that can filter out all comments before the comments are added to the website or newspaper for the readers to read
__label__noRel	There should be a warning to ban the account of someone who uses hate words in the comment section.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	this asks internet users to give up their right to anonymity	i believe commenting should have it's policy, where users have to read the policy before commenting. So if a user uses language that promotes hate speech, the comment should be removed.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	I know this has been discussed a few times potentially in reply to comments but I'd like to repeat it again: language is complex and you can't simply ban or flag certain terms or phrases and think you catch all the hate speech comments etc. While a report button and the use of a software that can support a human moderator is in essence a good idea, it might also delete comments that do not actually contain HS or completely miss others overall. I think this decision by the newspaper turned into an entire discussion of manageability of monitoring discussion sections and away from the ethical considerations.
__label__noRel	The moderator needs to not be too strict	Online comment spaces should be platforms promoting free speech, with some restrictions in place. Human or digital moderators (AI) could be used to identify comments and phrases constituting hate speech and remove them from the platform without hindering people's ability to share their authentic views.
__label__noRel	This puts the power in many people's hands	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	This still poses an issue with what people think is acceptable. You run the risk of people joining in as opposed to call it out.	In my opinion the comment section should not be removed. I personally get very annoyed if I watch or read something and want to express my opinion, then go down to the comment section to sadly find out the comments are turned off. This limits the freedom of speech and blocks the ability for the people to vent out somehow. I think this builds aggression and causes problems afterwards. The better thing to do is to limit bad speech, foul words and cursing but removing the comments completely is not a good idea.
__label__noRel	It is very difficult to police all the contributions	Is space for readers comment really that necessary? Nowadays, with all other social medias available, the conversation can happen on platform made for dialogue. But as practice shows, those "conversations" are often very polarized and everyone is kind of screaming in a void.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	There need to be some kind of moderation, either before or after comments are published
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	the fairly way of reducing hate speech from newspapers website is not allowing anyone to comment that is to bloc the comment section.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	This is a good idea, there are a lot of sites that use AI bots that block out hate speech, bad words, and they are more appropriate for all ages. Keeps the tone of the comments at a decent level	Some people will always use hate speech and hide behind their computer, There needs to be some sort of filter added to flag such comments and people and a ban put on the user
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	I think one way to reduce hate speech online would be monitoring the message. If someone writes a message, it should be checked before allowing it to be posted, it could be done by a simple program where the computer looks for offensive words.
__label__noRel	AI unfortunately does inherit the biases of it's creators and is by no means a perfect solution.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	it can be regulated	By having an algorithm that detects and deletes any hate speech comment.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	I think removing the comment space is just avoiding the problem. There can be interesting and thoughtful comments and we would miss from them. Newspapers websites should instead try to regulate the comment space by introducing a bot or hiring appropriate moderators or there should be some punishment to discourage the use of hate speech.
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	someone to check their posts before the article goes live, like a robot think
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Hate speech can mean different things to different people
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	Go through and censor out certain words
__label__noRel	What happens if they are detected falsely using hate speech	Allow users to report comments.
__label__noRel	I agree, public debate is good.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

As already demonstrated by other bigger social media companies, algorithms often contain and reinforce the negative biases of its creators, so I'm not sure how effective they would be in detecting and filtering out hate speech.
__label__noRel	there might be a negative effect on the newspaper being sold	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	I agree	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	readers comments be moderated and anything that is harmful, hateful or hurtful should be removed. this allows people to exercise their right of freedom of speech but limiting the harm that someones opinion may have
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	I agree with this, as it creates a more safe space for everyone	Identifying users with hate speech and restricting their accounts from using the platform and commenting on it.
__label__noRel	When people are given choice to comment, trolls will come out naturally and therefore so will hate speech. You can only educate those willing to be educated.	The technical team of the newspaper should select comments that don't promote hate speech and make those comments the only ones that are going to appear on the newspaper's websites.
__label__noRel	This would be removing freedom of speech. I think that is a very problematic road to go down.	Reduce hate speech by screening out certain words. If a comment contains such words, it is deleted or hidden from public view
__label__noRel	it has to be completely restricted	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	Less people will be willing to pay.	we can do that by having strict rules on language and hate speech where one can be blocked from commenting or their comments gets removed if there is any negativity
__label__noRel	i agree with this. although i believe that freedom of speech and hate speech do not have a visible line. thus someone may be hiding behind the guise of freedom of speech but spewing hate rhetoric.	We can fairly reduce hate speech from newspapers websites without eliminating space for readers comments by encouraging people to give a reward who will comment without hate speech.
__label__noRel	I do not agree that it should be allowed to be there at all.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I agree that removing the comments section is not a solution to stopping hate speech as this just encourages users to go to different platforms, users need to be able to post their opinions but newspapers should have a responsibility to monitor what is being posted as well as a responsibility on the tone of articles they post online as this can have an effect on the type of comments that users leave as some users will see an article and the tone of the article will make them respond in a controversial way which encourages hate speech.	up to this point, moderators have done a poor job as evidenced by the amount of hate speech so maybe the answer is simply to remove the ability to comment.
__label__noRel	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button	Having read all of the previous discussion surrounding this debate, I still stand by my original opinion. Moderating comments by an official representative of the newspaper doesn't allow for free speech. We do however, need to eliminate hate speech. I think the best way to do this is to put this in the hands of the community and other readers.
__label__noRel	I do not think this is fair on the people who genuinely want to have a fair conversation on the subject.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people.

__label__noRel	Absolutely, vague definitions are the downfall of effective communication. A lot like "Karen" replacing the actual words for situations like racist, entitled, rude, emotionally volatile, unreasonable etc. When we all hold a different definition for a word because it's been used too broadly it becomes harder to communicate. Clearly defining what hate speech is with links to the definitions in every format is what could help. People consume information more effectively in different modes like audio, visual, written etc.	they need to as often it is minorities which are affected
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Is space for readers comment really that necessary? Nowadays, with all other social medias available, the conversation can happen on platform made for dialogue. But as practice shows, those "conversations" are often very polarized and everyone is kind of screaming in a void.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	I believe the fairest way is the hardest way and that's to have a small group of people moderating REAL hate speech and spam. If someone wants to just use a racist term or promote their website, then these people's comment should be removed and they should be banned from commenting for a period of time. The idea to remove comments entirely is absurd as the news is not trustworthy enough to be the sole voice people hear. We need to hear other voices.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	Readers should be able to comment but be informed of certain comments that would be considered hate speech. If they are aware and still choose to comment hateful words, the newspaper website should feel comfortable enough to remove those comments since the reader was informed that comments like those would not be acceptable.
__label__noRel	I don't think blocking key words that in the majority could only be expressed in a hateful way would give them unilateral power. it is possible to do this under instagram posts and I dont think the majority of people would even notice	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	I think by holding the people that use hateful speech accountable i.e., blocking them from accessing newspaper websites
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	Hate speech blocking should not be implemented, people must learn to take some criticism in a positive way, it can be helpful.
__label__noRel	I think people are completely aware that they are spouting 'hate' messages, they just don't care. Education is a total waste of time. They are bullies.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	Having a comments section can be ideal to engage in a healthy debate but will need to monitored very strictly to ensure there is no bullying or one sided views be taken against any individuals
__label__noRel	how do you decide what is disrespecful?	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks.

__label__noRel	But it also means that the newspaper will have full control over what is being posted and can filter certain opinions as well as hate speech to create a biased community look if they want to. Since they would never go on air, there would be no history of the page you can compare to.	they should monitor all comments and block people that post hate comments or censor certain hate words
__label__noRel	removing certain words would definitely prevent people from purposely stirring up hatred through the comment speech	Just pay moderators
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	reducing hate speech on the newspaper websites is possible without taking the drastic measures of completely cancelling the comment section one way of doing that there should be moderators who approve the comment before they are published on the website.
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	I think the best way to reduce hate speech in newspaper websites is to ensure that the site can detect words and phrases that can be considered hate speech, and block them from being posted on the comment section.

__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	It is important for people to voice their opions so I do not thik this discussion is fair, however I do agree that comments should be moderated. The readers should also be made aware of the rules that apply to commenting with regards to hateful speech.
__label__noRel	I agree, this gives people the option to learn from mistakes before handing them a more severe punishment and that would be banning them or removing their comments	I believe hate speech should be moderated and perhaps shadow-banned. That way users who post comments which are marked by the moderators as hate speech would never know they were banned and would not create new accounts or post more hateful comments.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	Block known accounts with a history of hate speech
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	I think that people should sign up and verify their identity before they are able to leave a comment on a news platform so they are not anonymous and anything that is written can be tracked to the individual and they can be held accountable. Many people write such hateful things anonymously.

__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	Comment sections need to be well-moderated, and if algoritmic or user comment flagging is used this needs to also be reviewed by a human moderator to ensure that there is no bias or bad faith reporting going on.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	There needs to be rules and regulations stating the type of comments that can be made about other people. There should also be verification of a persons identity everytime they make a comment so that is visible who the statement was made by. Newspaper articles should constantly ready and delete hate speech comment.

__label__noRel	When your beliefs are entwined with your identity, changing your mind means changing your identity. That’s really hard for most people.	I think using a platform which blocks out certain words, kind of like a filter would help. So if someone made a post with a certain word in, that post would not be made public, instead the comment would be flagged and go to a admin, who can read the comment and then decide if the 'bot' which flagged it was correct or not, and then deciding if to allow the post to be made or not
__label__noRel	It is still difficult because then you are removing everyone's entitlement to an opinion	Rarely some very sensitive articles should be allowed to switch off comments sector.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	most people seem to be of the opinion that cutting comments altogether is not constructive. A good point was made by an individual that viewing opinions from people you like only doesn't help you to grow (echo chamber).
__label__noRel	I disagree. Democracy cannot progress if others are punished for the misdeeds of a few people. A headache simply will not be solved by cutting the head off. Other devices such as comment monitoring and elimination can prove useful.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	The comment space allows positive ideas to filter through	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	That would take away free speech, however I think they need to add some sort of AI that can immediately pick up any forms of hate speech and immediately delete or even block it
__label__noRel	that is true the developers hate to filter, using mods and bots to detect the hate speech	the removal of comment spaces is not good for the well being of humans because other people share ideas using the comment space and other comments can make certain people happy.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.

There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	Re-education sounds quite dystopian.	Hate speech should be flagged, hidden and the user should be given a strike. People should be able to still view those comments with a "trigger warning" disclaimer. After 3 strikes the user should be banned from commenting. But they should still be able to view the newspaper so that they don't miss an article that probably would have helped that particular person to change their behavior . More safe and reliable ways of verifying accounts should also be implemented.
__label__noRel	By making rules we might lose some viewers.	Removing the comment section all together is a fair point as news is meant to be fair and impartial. People share their opinions based on their biases and that's not what the news is for - that's what social media is for. But in this case allowing the comment section to remain would be great if people would not abuse the power to share freely by sharing hate speech and slander. us as humans need to be regulated by a set of rules in order to keep a functioning society and i think a filtered comment section is the solution.
__label__noRel	the issue with an algorithm is that is isnt able to sympathise with news. yes it is good to filter out bad words but i think hate speech can be relative to the user digesting that information	exclude certain words from being posted
__label__noRel	people can share creative ideas and hateful words and ideas are not used	I agree that moderating the comment section with flagged phrases that automatically send comments for quick moeration would be a good solution.
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons
__label__noRel	I agree that providing ID could be a way to help with this.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I agree but in reality, it is hard to carry out. It would require newspapers to work with law enforcement and there may be legal issues with the sharing of people's personal data. You also run the risk of this data being stolen or sold to groups or governments that should not be trusted with such data.	If comments that create hate speech are removed/moderated, you can not complain about loss of freedom of speech as you are then being discrimantory, rather than speaking freely, and there is a difference.
__label__noRel	I agree, however the issue then becomes 'How do we go about finding the root cause '	every comment submitted by readers must be checked internally for hate speech
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Having moderators remove hateful speech and providing better education.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	By simply educating people about what harm hate speech can do to a person
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	Sadly not everyone can be polite enough to express themselves without the use of hate speech, hence such people should be blocked as we cannot tolerate it.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Moderating comments sections is a lot of work to do manually, the individuals tasked with it would burn out in short time trying to manage that effectively while also having to read hateful garbage all day. If there was a system to remove hate speech it needs to be automated with an algorithm that catches certain words, then reviewed manually when someone disagrees with the content removed and it not being against guidelines. We use guidelines for everything including media regulations for accurate reporting or having to retract when information is not accurate. It's no different in the comments section, it doesn't remove free speech it regulates it to create a healthy environment to have a conversation in. Over moderation can have as severe of an effect as under, it has to be a system that takes in common complaints from both sides. Not the hate speech side per say but the sides of people who are pro free flowing conversation and those who want more shielding to avoid extremist echo chambers.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	I think the best way to reduce hate speech in newspaper websites is to ensure that the site can detect words and phrases that can be considered hate speech, and block them from being posted on the comment section. Also, a moderator to approve each comment section before it becomes publicly accessible is a notion which can be adopted as well.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	someone to check their posts before the article goes live, like a robot think
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	Awareness campaigns need to be implemented to teach people about the significance of avoiding hate speech.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	I have found that as well as reading the articles from newspapers, I have also been paying keen attention to the comments section of the article. Either on the newspaper site or on social media. I find that while the opinions of the article presens the views and research of the author, the comments offer an alternative viewpoint and opinions. A chance to see if the article hit the right note, and an opportunity to understand positives and negatives of a topic raised.
__label__noRel	readers should be able to have their say	Ultimately the comments are needed to gather feedback in certain situations, removing the comments section wouldn't help us eliminate hate speech because where information needs to be gathered, no blacklist will help.
__label__noRel	This leaves space for people to bully and be toxic without any consequences	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Recent political positions in the UK have lead to more fighting for 'free speech' and saying that it is ok to be offended - this is shown in a police news release (https://www.college.police.uk/article/protecting-freedom-expression-updated-guidance). I would disagree - offending people is unacceptable.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	It is easy to be hateful online when you are anonymous. Before being able to comment on newspaper websites, users should be required to sign up using traceable methods (eg. some form of identification). The comment section should regularly be monitored and any users who post hate speech should face serious consiquences
__label__noRel	I don't agree. There are too many people who shouldn't have access to the Internet. They hide behind their PC screens and writes a lot of things they would never dare to say in reality. They believe they can say everything that comes to their minds when they can hide behind a PC screen, and that lowers the quality in the comments section. And there are laws against racism and other topics than they can use as triggers.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	unfortunately, people may continue to not adhere with the proper language of communication under comments.	by giving guide lines on the comment section
__label__noRel	" Blocking users or deleting comments because they express critical opinions offends the Constitution and principles of transparency" - https://www.aclu-nj.org/en/know-your-rights/when-public-officials-censor-you-social-media	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	yes. good moderators are the key	I agree that it all should be reviewed before it is published
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	Some people will always use hate speech and hide behind their computer, There needs to be some sort of filter added to flag such comments and people and a ban put on the user
__label__noRel	agreed. no one body/company should be given that much power. dialogue and transparency is the cornerstone of any democracy	/?Are there ways to better police it and identify key words/phrases? Is there an automated moderator program?
__label__noRel	I agree having an algorithm to delete specific words and phrases.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	The editor must appoint a diverse panel, meaning from different backgrounds to screen comments
__label__noRel	I completely agree with this. Instead of removing and upsetting people and removing their right to speak just bring in the moderators and then this way people can still comment and then there would be less hate speech	Is space for readers comment really that necessary? Nowadays, with all other social medias available, the conversation can happen on platform made for dialogue. But as practice shows, those "conversations" are often very polarized and everyone is kind of screaming in a void.
__label__noRel	I disagree, try to read everyone's idea. Some are feasible and doable	the removal of comment spaces is not good for the well being of humans because other people share ideas using the comment space and other comments can make certain people happy.
__label__noRel	The united states supreme court has upheld the right to anonymity: McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/514/334/ "Anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority"	by checking what people comment befor approval
__label__noRel	In a fast moving comments section with lots of commentators it would be impossible to moderate in real time.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	A moderating team might work but it could also be hard to revise every comment, specially is the newspaper is popular	I think we need to develop a way to recognize hate speech in comments so that it is easy to monitor comment sections for derogatory and offensive language. There are studies on how to go about this for example if you follow this link it talks about "A Feature-Based Approach to Assess Hate Speech in User Comments" https://www.cairn.info/revue-questions-de-communication-2020-2-page-529.htm
__label__noRel	It is great to ban them but they would create different profiles again to put out their comments. One good side of this idea is that they would consistently have to do extra work in creating new profiles to put out their hate speeches, and hopefully, one day they would be tired and give up.	Removing the comment section from online newspapers is not the answer. Allowing people to post their opinions is healthy and a normal part of human society- people will not always agree. However, in order to reduce hate speech, which can so often lead to crime, it could be done so that there are monitors (either human or computer) who check comments before they are posted to ensure they are not hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	i agree that removing comments about hate speech is not the way to go
__label__noRel	The comment space allows positive ideas to filter through	I don't think removing the comment section reduces hate speech per se, it just pushes it elsewhere. I can't help feeling this sort of censorship is an infringement on free speech.
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	By ticking a box to agree not to be abusive or hateful before being allowed to comment
__label__noRel	already said	Make readers agree to not sharing hate speech and let them know that if they do, they will be blocked from commenting.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	By utilising AI so that it can look for certain words that could be deemed offensive.
__label__noRel	There needs to be some space to discuss the news to encourage conversation and fact checking.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	this would be very difficult to police, although i do think its a good starting point	A machine filtering comments would have a positive affect as then people still have the freedom of speech without the vulger and disrespectful language
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	by having it monitored and removing hate speech at source
__label__noRel	agree to some extent but it removes accountability from the journal itself.	Computers should be able to detect hate speech if there is any and report and remove that comment whinin minutes of posting it
__label__noRel	The newspaper should also boost positive messages of tolerance.	By putting in a classing program that will read and class information as it enters. That way things will work nicely and we wont see more of hate speech
__label__noRel	yes. good moderators are the key	I totally agree that hate speech should be limited as some readers do not take it lightly and may harm themselves after reading. I have heard stories about people ending their lives after their stories which often are embarassing are published, and the situation made worse by the comment section.
__label__noRel	I absolutely agree with that position. As much as I hope and believe people should not resort to hate speech, but rather have a civilized conversation and respect each other's opinions, I am aware people might simply not be capable of that. Also - hate speech is not illegal in most countries. Quote from Wikipedia: "While "hate speech" is not a legal term in the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that most of what would qualify as hate speech in other western countries is legally protected free speech under the First Amendment." Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_in_the_United_States	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	I definitely agree with your position, a certain level of regulation is needed, as looking at the current situation there are still many problems regarding online comments.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	in my opinion there should be no comment section , article should be true and commenting no needed
__label__noRel	The media should not be in control of what we view, though. And I can see the side of your thinking. Perhaps with the option to view said removed comments makes this more plausible for you? I wonder how that changes your opinion, if at all of course.	you should autoban key hate speech words
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	In a survey of news sites it was found that on average 11% of comments are removed...some of these are because they are spam and some because they are offensive. I think that the fact that it's more than one in two really shows how necessary moderation is, these issues are so common. Source: https://netino.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/WAN-IFRA_Online_Commenting.pdf (pg 7)
__label__noRel	If a media regulate how people respond to their news, they can aid the fight against hate speech.	I don't think removing the comment section reduces hate speech per se, it just pushes it elsewhere. I can't help feeling this sort of censorship is an infringement on free speech.

__label__noRel	Yes, they can deeply hurt anyone's internal peace	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	The problem is some form of censorship would be required for writers if the definition of "hate speech" isn't universally agreed. Perhaps a trigger warning for readers of a sensitive disposition could be given at the start of an article. Different countries have different laws or understandings of hate speech. Will comments from different countries have to be blocked?	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Moderating comments is a far better method than eliminating comments entirely. I feel a method for reporting comments, though not perfect, is better, and then reported comments can be examined and removed if necessary.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	Some people just like to spread their negative vibes on strangers, not worried about serious consequences, as the worst thing that can happen to them is the comment being removed. There should be consequences!
__label__noRel	i agree, this would be useful as it can keep other comments	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	not all stories need people to add their opinions sothat should ease the pressure on moderators
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I don't think blocking key words that in the majority could only be expressed in a hateful way would give them unilateral power. it is possible to do this under instagram posts and I dont think the majority of people would even notice	Provide a clear definition on what is considered hate speech and eliminate those comments that fit in that definition
__label__noRel	there are some words which are universally offensive and never add to discussion	Everyone is entitled to freedom of speech but hate speech can be detrimental to readers and the topics mental health. I think the best way to deal with hate speech is to have filtered comments, raising awareness and age restrictions on wensites and comment sections
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry.

__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	the comment section is for sharing information and opinions without the need of hate speech. those who promote and share hate speech should get banned from the comment section

__label__noRel	my thoughts exactly..Hate speech can also be helpful in improving the news papers.	There should be automatic filters but they are not 100, so there should also be a team of people constanly monitoring and reviewing complaints and reports. I feel like it is the only way to keep the freedom of speech but also protect people who might be victims of it.
__label__noRel	I like it but i worry it would just be ignored. Just removing a comment isn't much of a deterrent	Moderation is key. Plenty of newspapers and online media are able to keep comments open with a bit of moderation.
__label__noRel	This would be very helpful	I think there has to be a system that can verify whether a person's comment contains hate speech and if it is found to contain hate speech, that person should not be allowed to leave the comment.
__label__noRel	IT is absoluety the websites job to police polirising comments if nesccearry to keep peace wihthin the outiside community viewing their newspapers.	Hate speech invites violence and undermines people

I am reminded while discussing this of the way Daily Mail in UK handles the comments section. It just mentions on top of the comments page that theses comments are not moderated.So it allows everybody to express their opionion. This is how it should be done in my opinion
__label__noRel	I agree that real time moderation	This is not just a newspaper comment section problem... it's a social media problem as well, more like an internet problem.

__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	the comment section should be set in a way that filters certain words that promote hate speech
__label__noRel	There must be an area for people to voice their opinions, even if some people use it to display aggression.	Using moderators, educating users, calling out trolls and haters!
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	People who take part in hate speech should be dealt with lawfully so as its a form of cyber-bullying, that way less people will resort to hate speech
__label__noRel	Hate speech an be considered a form of verbal assault. Why should we accept that?	This is a win or loose situation. People will still continue with their comments even if it is not on the newspapers website. A person can take a screenshot of the topic and then twit it on twitter and then people will give their different opinions. The newspaper can still allow for readers comment however, the hate speech comments can be filtered.

__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	AI algorithms are frequently biased. There's still a long way to go before reliable AI algorithms are developed. Until then, using AI algorithms alone to moderate the comment sections of newspapers will likely lead to harmless comments removed, and, on the other hand, harmful comments published. https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/02/04/the-role-of-bias-in-artificial-intelligence/?sh=3bf5308b579d	By using a tool that searches for likely words: hate, etc.
__label__noRel	I dont believe in censorship though. Commentary and opinions are important. We cannot say that just because some people might believe fake news we should only have one government authorized news source to protect people. People need to be less sensitive and also be aware enough to not take everything they read as being true.	By currating comments individualy in person upon reporting. Auto block certain words e.g N word
__label__noRel	Some may feel undermined.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	Freedom of expression is important for ordinary people to express themselves; fight injustice and support marginalised groups. Regimes that depend on achieving and holding power in undemocratic ways see free expression as a threat and restrict or close down the internet.	i believe commenting should have it's policy, where users have to read the policy before commenting. So if a user uses language that promotes hate speech, the comment should be removed.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	There should be repercussions to extensive hate speech e.g a limited ban to the forum etc. Use moderators and ensure that users understand the consequences of hate speech commente
__label__noRel	That seems very authoritative and draconic.	I'm a firm believer of freedom of speech therefore eliminating it in any form especially because of something that can be regulated like hate speech, to me is ridiculous.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	I agree with your ideas. I think it still gives people a voice but without going too far
__label__noRel	the thing is people always find a way to say those certain words.	The only possible way to reduce hate speech is to have some kind of algorithm that may recognise certain words and phrases. Other than that it would mean moderating the comment section.
__label__noRel	This is unlikely to be feasible. United states courts have repeatedly upheld a right to anonymity in this context: https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/why-ending-anonymity-would-not-make-social-media-better.php	Everybody should be able to express its own idea.

__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	Moderating comments is a far better method than eliminating comments entirely. I feel a method for reporting comments, though not perfect, is better, and then reported comments can be examined and removed if necessary.
__label__noRel	I agree	I think that the warning system is a good route, as the AI might eliminate valid arguments and miss hate speech accidentally. A warning system would still need an AI, but it warns users that their comment may be hate speech and if it is, the user can rethink their wording or risk posting it. If they post it, maybe a manual review can happen to determine if it was hate speech or not.
__label__noRel	I agree	I feel like there are certain topics for which disabling comments is the best option. For example extremely sensitive stories about severe crimes or ones that involve children.
__label__noRel	agreed.AI woudl be more objective and impartial thtn human moderators	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	you should autoban key hate speech words

Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	Self-opinion is illogical at times, but people are entitled to whatever non-harmful opinions they like. Except in the case of psychics and other charlatans.	I understand that there will always be people saying the comment section needs to stay as we are all allowed free speech.
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	agree with this totally, and I think that was my opinion earlier	there needs to be some form of ceneorship of what newspaper can post i dont mean full censorship i just mean around things realating to hate of certain group
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	I think the first step to reducing hate speech in readers comments should be in the form of a moderation team in which they filter inappropriate comments. I think it should be a group of people rather than AI to do this to ensure all hate speech within a variety of contexts are eliminated, as if this was done by a computer there is risk of hate spilling through. For example, hate speech on the social media platform Twitter can often be missed as users purposefully misspell hateful speech to ensure it does not flag up on the AI searches, going as far as hateful language misspelt actually trending on Twitter.

Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	Use technology to monitor and block users
__label__noRel	This was a great way to show what will happen to free speech	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	Exactly, it's a slippery slope when a system is doing all the work https://www.cairn.info/revue-questions-de-communication-2020-2-page-529.htm	Hate speech should not be allowed to dominate the narrative as it defeats the process and hinders effective communication. As a result, flagging and blocking of problematic accounts can prove to be effective in combating the spread of hate speech.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	By having stricter controls over who can sign up to the comments and blocking them from the sites when they use hate speech. It's unfortunate that it happens, but sometimes they are loud just to get attention. Starve them of it.
__label__noRel	I agree	Have human and AI to verify potential hateful speech. Given our current resources we should be able to allocate a human check given the rating of the flag by the AI
__label__noRel	Time consuming	Is it actually their responsibilty?
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Once you are found commenting with hate speech, you should apologize

__label__noRel	How is this going to stop trolls that create multiple accounts so that if they are blocked they just do it from another faceless account consequences.l	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	time consuming	One mainstream way of mitigating hate speech on online comment sections is to pre-moderate comments. This however may lead to a 'biased' viewpoint. A lighter example of this could be how some youtubers delete constructive criticism.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Some of the comment section of some newspaper articles are not worth reading and may sometimes spoil the reading experience. https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	Hate speech is subjective and as such should not be censored.
__label__noRel	I also agree with this. This solution is a middle ground between two extremes.	Websites should invest in software to remove hate speech, this would allow for healthy debate without racist or descrimination.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	I think that once you go down the route of cancelling comments, you run the risk of an almost dictatorship position for the newspapers, to be able to say what they like with no comeback from anyone.	Letting individuals know that as soon as someone comments, that is no longer confidential and if it is hate speech they shall be reported to authorities
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	The algorithm should have code that detects certain hate speech words and shadow bans them so as they do not appear on the site. with a warning that it will happen if the post is posted.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	I have found that as well as reading the articles from newspapers, I have also been paying keen attention to the comments section of the article. Either on the newspaper site or on social media. I find that while the opinions of the article presens the views and research of the author, the comments offer an alternative viewpoint and opinions. A chance to see if the article hit the right note, and an opportunity to understand positives and negatives of a topic raised.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	One user by the name of AndreaP said in order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section Newspapers should be one sided providers. I strongly disagree with this argument. It is very autocratic and happens a lot in countries where media and citizens does not have freedom and oppressed by harsh leadership. Comments in newspapers help many to get raw information from the ground and open minds of many to see issues differently from differing opinions. Indeed comments section are necessary
__label__noRel	This should prevent such comments from being printed, but I think any attempt to 'educate' such persons is totally futile. They are hard-wired to hold that point of view, often drilled into them by parents/caregivers.	due to the changing world and the improvement of technology,the internet is like a black canvas and anyone can put anything they want on it,but even though technology is improving most websites dont use basic protection,they could do things like add comment filters,then this ensures that hateful words or phrases cannot be used but positive and informative words and statements can be
__label__noRel	flagging comments would be an easier way	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	In order to reduce hate speech in the comments section, newspapers need to employ moderators on their platforms so that there can be someone watching and removing all types of hate speech in the comments section.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	I feel like people's wellbeing should be the priority, and those targeted by hate speech might be gravely affected by commenter's words. To me this is more important than people's right to free speech.	Readers should not be given a false assumption on the understandings of others.
__label__noRel	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	While freedom of speech is a human right, it is imperative to be cognizant of the fact that each and every person has the right to have their rights respected. It is for this reason that readers comments cannot be removed. Everyone has the right to make a comment and we do not necessarily always have to agree, we always have to respect. A system can be put in place to remove any vulgar language.
__label__noRel	It can be difficult to monitor everything all the time, but I think if something is reported and not deleted then fair enough.	More control by moderators plus a code of conduct for users
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Hire moderators and similar positions, and also having filtering systems
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	Large companies need to invest more money in having paiI td moderators to monitor hate speech on their articles. I think all speech excpet for speech inciting people to commit violence or murder should be allowed even if i so not agree with it. I think that to prevent hate sppech it will start with educating young people

While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Nowadays with the amount of social media platforms that are available newspapers don't hold as much power. We get all of our news through the spreading of news in social media as seen in this article : https://kettlemag.co.uk/social-media-versus-print-media/
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it.

__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	One way I propose to prevent hate speech is to remove anonymity online. Not being able to hide should limit cowardly behavior and thus reduce harmful speech.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	Ultimately the comments are needed to gather feedback in certain situations, removing the comments section wouldn't help us eliminate hate speech because where information needs to be gathered, no blacklist will help.
__label__noRel	Removing any form of comments or place for discussion may reduce hate speech, but also prevents discussion, leading to one sided arguments	In summary, I think we should not remove comment sections. We need to "teach" AI to filter the comment section on newspaper websites. In that way, we can add or remove filters, and AI will simply do the work of making sure the comment section is appropriate. People should not get involved to directly filter comments, they may not be fair at all.
__label__noRel	Less Issues with arguments and trolls	I believe that with real time moderation , if the comments can be removed before causing any distress to people then this is a better option than removing the ability to make comments.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Hate speech is a form of self publicity. If the community isolates the perpetrators by flagging negative content that would be helpful. Flagged content would then need to be followed by banning perpetrators
__label__noRel	I agree because it will be easy to identify hate speech like this without completely taking away the ability to express opinions	they should monitor all comments and block people that post hate comments or censor certain hate words
__label__noRel	I agree. Accountability is extremly important for public confidence, so very important that this happens	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	also would allow anyone to say whatever hate they havem to say	I definately think the way forward is to have moderators that will review all comments before they get posted.They can then approve or disapprove all the comments and flag inappropiate user names. Yiou could also add a way for the readers to flag inappropiate comments and these will also flag to the moderators.
__label__noRel	Care must be taken not to accidentally block users	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	There should be people assigned to go over the comments provided in order to ensure that the final approved posts do not contain hate speech. Basically a team set up to censor comments accordingly
__label__noRel	Less people expressing there hate online does not mean that hate crimes will decrease in numbers. It will be just harder to prosecute people	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I agree	Hate speech is a problem but we do need to have debate. We need to respect different views and allow people to voice their opinion where necessary to further a debate on a news topic. Having the comments vetted before they appear does allow for some censorship but that must not be at the cost of open discussion.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	someone to check their posts before the article goes live, like a robot think
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way.

__label__noRel	Yes this is a very important consideration in that we dont operate in a homogenous society. and culturally we are not the same, so what I consider harsh hate speech might just be considered banter to another group of society.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	newspapers are unlikely to policy it as no publicity is bad publicity to them. the more engagements they get, the better.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	I can see their point of view, however hate speech can't be considered a viewpoint as most times there isn't even a good enough argument to support people that leave hate speech's point of view.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	This would be removing freedom of speech. I think that is a very problematic road to go down.	By utilising AI so that it can look for certain words that could be deemed offensive.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	This is an interesting article on the outcomes of several news agencies that disabled the comments section. Some of the writers of articles were getting subjected to abusive messages. This would be another argument for verified profiles only allowed to access the websites with their real names and details.
__label__noRel	This is frequently used in social media platforms now, but it can be quite time consuming. Also the tone of a statement can be misinterpreting in text format.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Comment sections need to be well-moderated, and if algoritmic or user comment flagging is used this needs to also be reviewed by a human moderator to ensure that there is no bias or bad faith reporting going on.
__label__noRel	To understand how this can be managed in order that peoples opinionsare taken into account and not dismissed.	Could ensure moderation of commonly used words for hate speech, and frequent moderation on these websites
__label__noRel	Monitoring and moderating is not enough. It wont solve the problem. Look at this study: https://www.cairn.info/revue-questions-de-communication-2020-2-page-529.htm	Hate speech is a form of self publicity. If the community isolates the perpetrators by flagging negative content that would be helpful. Flagged content would then need to be followed by banning perpetrators
__label__noRel	Allows people to express their views.	by checking what people comment befor approval
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	There needs to be proper moderation of comments so that no hate speech slips through the net. This would make more work for the newspapers but would only require one person to constantly monitor what is being submitted and only allow reasonable comments.
__label__noRel	Stops the bullying and people feeling bad	I think that only people who provided identifying information can post their opinions. Also I agree that there should be AL tools to prevent hate speech. Eliminating hate speech from newspaper websites has nothing to do with the infringement of the free speech right.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	Comments are important as it can help create a balanced view and promote healthy discussion, maybe software could pick up on key words or phrases and then a moderator could look more in depth at questionable comments.

__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Is it necessary to have readers comments? What do they add to the article?
__label__noRel	Absolutely true. Everyone has freedom of speech. We live in a democratic country where everyone have the right to speak and all voices need to be heard. It is up to the individual to make sure that they put forward their points without being too aggressive and not getting carried away.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	Reduces free speech	we could filter the comments and have a panel to decide
__label__noRel	The public are not experts and their views should not be publicised as such.	Moderating comments is a far better method than eliminating comments entirely. I feel a method for reporting comments, though not perfect, is better, and then reported comments can be examined and removed if necessary.
__label__noRel	Potentially reduces correction or dissenting information on the article	Removing the comment section will not solve the problem. It will just create a filling of censorship and will make debate and dialogue vanish. It is important that people discuss news topics and also give feedback on those news to the newspaper. It is important to moderate this comments in a strict no hate speech way and bring accountability in. Eliminating comments will just hide a problem that needs to be fixed by moderating and educating people.
__label__noRel	I agree	I'm of the supporting view that the use of AI to filter out Hate speech could prove to be very useful
__label__noRel	I agree	The best thing would be to have some sort of app that monitors and regulate the language used. in a case where hate speech is found in a comment, the sentence should be blurred out.
__label__noRel	Give option to delete bad comments	We can start by encouraging people to debate and say their opinions to incite meaningful and helpful conversations and comments instead of hate and other harmful communication types
__label__noRel	hate speech affects people differently, it might not affect some but it differently hurt others	the website should have terms and conditions on the words that can be used and warnings if failure to follow the recommended words .
__label__noRel	I agree with this idea. It feels like the easiest one to apply or at least to start with. From what I know, there are no algorithms applying this on newspapers, so it would still be a starting point against hatred and aggressive behaviours.	To ensure freedom of speech is still maintained, moderation needs to be carried out fairly. To achieve this, we need to understand what is hate speech and what are the lines that seperate that with constructive criticism. Attached is an article by the Standford encyclopedia of physiosphy regarding hate speech. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hate-speech/
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Hate speech is so prevalent nowadays that proper measures should be taken in order to limit these harmful comments. However to stop people from expressing their opinions is creating another problem altogether. Those who aren't able to make help contributions should be blocked and stripped of their right to do so.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	the best way to address hate speech to make it clear to the viewers regarding the consequence of hate speech. Also, only individuals who have registered on the platform after providing their details can be allowed to comment. furthermore, new accounts must be placed on a probation period and cannot be allowed to comment on the same day that they are created.
__label__noRel	Removing the comments section won't make much difference as people just migrate to different platforms to continue posting hate speech, the EU setup a code of conduct for countering illegal hate speech, https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/combatting-discrimination/racism-and-xenophobia/eu-code-conduct-countering-illegal-hate-speech-online_en, this has had an effect on hate speech online and is something that newspapers can be part of if they want to help stop hate speech being posted by users responding to online articles.	Hate speech invites violence and undermines people
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	I agree with some other opinions on the use of A1 to flag or censor certain words that constitute hate or violent speech. It would also be beneficial to have a human supervisor from the organisation and another external body review the activities of the AI to ensure accuracy and consistency.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	we could use bots the get triggered when certain words are used. The bot will therefore remove the comment andhold it until it has mannually reviewed by a human. Another option can be to allow the users to report comments from other users and if the reports reach a certain threshold then hold that comment for review.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	report anyone as soon as it is seen so they can be dealt with and removed.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	I don't think algorithms are the answer. They need to be very, very sophisticated otherwise they require a human mediator.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	Media isn't about sparking debate it's about catching our attention, profiting off our attention and sharing their biased view with us. Some countries have tighter regulations for media than others as well, plus they write salacious headlines for sale knowing people won't always read the full text of the article. They cause the polarization in conversation.	I think filtering hate speech comments can do that and allowing a better more positive and a welcome experience to all readers.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	hate speech is a reflection of two sides of a story ,all side of the story need to be published to allow the public to make up their own minds .
__label__noRel	I agree that AI moderators offer an ideal solution. I think it's worth considering that having human moderators would mean that there are individuals who have to read through hate speech regularly. This research article provides more detail on this point: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/09/220916112424.htm	hate speech must be clearly defined, it should not be left to the media to decide what is and is not considered hate speech
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.

__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	by giving guide lines on the comment section
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	The difficulty with reducing hate speech, is that it is everywhere. It cannot feasibly be reduced with human power, but rather requires a computer system. The difficulty with an electronic system, is that it inherently requires money and financing, and therefore is incentivised to make money. When money is in the equation; thoughts, politics and ideas can be easily manipulated by those funding the system
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I believe moderation should occur instead of total removal to allow people. to express their views	Having read through the opinions of others, my stance has not completely changed. It is important to censor comments, freedom of speech does not always equate to disrespecting the views and opinions of others. While I agree that comments should be censored, I do not agree that every comment should be removed. As mentioned before, a system can be implemented that removes comments with certain words, thus making the comment section a safe space for all who use it.
__label__noRel	Trolling is human nature, it will never stop so measures need to be placed because this problem will never change unless people change. https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/03/29/the-future-of-free-speech-trolls-anonymity-and-fake-news-online/	I think that education is the way to go about it, Humans must respect opposing views of others and tolerant society should be encouraged at all times instead of censorship
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	Removing the comment section will not solve the problem.

I believe hate speech should be moderated and perhaps shadow-banned. That way users who post comments which are marked by the moderators as hate speech would never know they were banned and would not create new accounts or post more hateful comments.
__label__noRel	I think the comment space should be monitored by the newspaper for a more standard approach, because a lot of people have subjective views on what hate speech could be.	there needs to be some form of ceneorship of what newspaper can post i dont mean full censorship i just mean around things realating to hate of certain group

__label__noRel	Agreed, more understanding and education are always good for society. Moderation functions as a good intermediary for discussion.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I think hate speech should not be accepted . If its published on news platform then that signifies that its is condoned!	every comment submitted by readers must be checked internally for hate speech
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	I disagree with this. I think taking away discussion completely also takes away healthy debate and positive conversation. There are ways to reduce hate comments, such as the ones outlined in this Forbes article: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnrampton/2015/04/09/10-tips-to-dealing-with-trolls/?sh=58ddf0f754f4.	Maybe the only solution is to remove the space for comments? We see the same issues on other platforms that allow comments!
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.

It affects people's lives with real consequences, resulting with cases such as severe depression and suicide. https://www.journalofcommunication.ro/index.php/journalofcommunication/article/view/322/307	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	that requires people who play by the rules	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	Critical discussions are essential to democratic nations	the website should have terms and conditions on the words that can be used and warnings if failure to follow the recommended words .
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	My final argument is that it is possible to monitor and reduce hate speech on website comments by using both AI and human intelligence
__label__noRel	IT is absoluety the websites job to police polirising comments if nesccearry to keep peace wihthin the outiside community viewing their newspapers.	people feel powerful behind an anonymous account, its easier to say things you would never normally say under the guise of anonymity, if it was easier to link a comment to who it came from and if people actually faced consequences from posting hate then this could help stop it.
__label__noRel	I agree	the comment section should be set in a way that filters certain words that promote hate speech
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	The algorithm should have code that detects certain hate speech words and shadow bans them so as they do not appear on the site. with a warning that it will happen if the post is posted.
__label__noRel	Disagree! people should be abl eto express themselves in a respectful manner.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	Moderation can be timely and expensive and then you wouldn't see comments in real time	I believe hate speech should be moderated and perhaps shadow-banned. That way users who post comments which are marked by the moderators as hate speech would never know they were banned and would not create new accounts or post more hateful comments.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	I think that only people who provided identifying information can post their opinions. Also I agree that there should be AL tools to prevent hate speech. Eliminating hate speech from newspaper websites has nothing to do with the infringement of the free speech right.
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	In the digital world we live in - unfortunately hate speech is part and parcel of the benefits of having such an open forum and allowing everyone to have a voice. Hate speech is made by a minuscule minority of people. Perhaps have a 'report hate speech' button that members of the community can use.
__label__noRel	I believe you are referencing an AI, but that would require certain technology and datasets for it to understand what to look for. You can also argue that hateful words can be used in a certain context to argue a point, rather than as a directly hateful comment.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	This should be a priority, some hate speech is not necessary
__label__noRel	I think the comment section is a good space for people to interact with the author instead of removing they should create or have an inbuilt AI that identifies bad words and mark the post as bad	I think allowing some special space to allow it also would be helpful instead of cutting comments off.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	I know this has been discussed a few times potentially in reply to comments but I'd like to repeat it again: language is complex and you can't simply ban or flag certain terms or phrases and think you catch all the hate speech comments etc. While a report button and the use of a software that can support a human moderator is in essence a good idea, it might also delete comments that do not actually contain HS or completely miss others overall. I think this decision by the newspaper turned into an entire discussion of manageability of monitoring discussion sections and away from the ethical considerations.
__label__noRel	I love the idea of implementing a filter/moderator so the respectful opinions are still allowed to be shared!	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	that the hatter can be revield	I am reminded while discussing this of the way Daily Mail in UK handles the comments section. It just mentions on top of the comments page that theses comments are not moderated.So it allows everybody to express their opionion. This is how it should be done in my opinion
__label__noRel	There needs to be a strict line between 'Free speech' and 'Hate speech'.	I think the first step to reducing hate speech in readers comments should be in the form of a moderation team in which they filter inappropriate comments. I think it should be a group of people rather than AI to do this to ensure all hate speech within a variety of contexts are eliminated, as if this was done by a computer there is risk of hate spilling through. For example, hate speech on the social media platform Twitter can often be missed as users purposefully misspell hateful speech to ensure it does not flag up on the AI searches, going as far as hateful language misspelt actually trending on Twitter.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	Critical discussions are essential to democratic nations	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	most people seem to be of the opinion that cutting comments altogether is not constructive. A good point was made by an individual that viewing opinions from people you like only doesn't help you to grow (echo chamber).
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	It is too dangerous to allow everyone and anyone to say exactly what they like, there has to be some rules in order to protect people. It's a form of manners that we expect from each other in every day life, and should be no different just because we are online saying something.	Monitoring of comment areas is not realistic

__label__noRel	It is nice to think we could reduce hate speech.	A possible way to address hate speech on newspaper sites would be to incorporate both human moderators and some sort of AI that monitors for hateful words and comments. The requirement to submit personally identifying information before commenting might also help because without this then anyone can create a fake name that hides the person's true identity so therefore more likely to engage in hate speech. If personal information is required, then hate speech would be less likely.
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	Charactertisation of hate speech should be done case-by-case, rather than applied universally
__label__noRel	But who defines what is 'hate' speech? People who share a different opinion to the author or another reader?	Large companies need to invest more money in having paiI td moderators to monitor hate speech on their articles. I think all speech excpet for speech inciting people to commit violence or murder should be allowed even if i so not agree with it. I think that to prevent hate sppech it will start with educating young people
__label__noRel	Negativity	We do have to allow people to express their opinions - we can't pretend opinions don't exist. Having them out in the open lets us know what we're dealing with. But at the same time hate speech can't be allowed to flourish and absolutely needs to be challenged. There is a role for AI (which I have said before I know) to try and weed out and remove anything that is just pure hate and not any sort of coherent argument or opinion.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	block swearing, abusive, discrimatory words- freedom of speech without rasicism, name calling etc
__label__noRel	Opinions shouldn't be classed as "hate speech". If some people (snowflakes) get triggered by different points of view they should refrain from reading the comments section rather than whine about "hate speech".	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	Having read all of the previous discussion surrounding this debate, I still stand by my original opinion. Moderating comments by an official representative of the newspaper doesn't allow for free speech. We do however, need to eliminate hate speech. I think the best way to do this is to put this in the hands of the community and other readers.
__label__noRel	Moderators need to act quickly to remove any hate speech	People should be allowed to say what they want. Other people can disagree - they should not allow themselves to be angered by opinions with which they disagree.
__label__noRel	It also may be neccesary to use the words, but in light of this would give a person a chance to think before they type, so to speak.	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	In an ideal world allowing all forms of free speech would be good but unfortunately it would likely result in racial and religious hatred and violent content.	the removal of comment spaces is not good for the well being of humans because other people share ideas using the comment space and other comments can make certain people happy.
__label__noRel	You'd have to get everyone to agree on a definition for cyber bullying before creating the software. Computers only know what you tell them, they aren't sentient beings capable of moral distinction. The human programming the software defines the meaning of hate speech, this really ties into the book "Noise" which discusses variables and the way it can drastically change outcomes based on the individual handling things. What is their life experience, have they experienced bullying, have they gotten therapy etc. If it's more than one person you have to collectively agree on shared experiences that culminate to the final definition of bullying.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	I feel like we somehow need to be a little bit more specific on which tools could work, because many times it could also be difficult to set limits in what can be said and what not. I would say that we could use a sort of algorithm which can recognize offensive comments and delete them.	have an admin or moderator remove inappropriate comments.
__label__noRel	By 'standards', maybe certain words should be blocked? Users who continue to post blocked words eventually being banned.	I agree that moderating the comment section with flagged phrases that automatically send comments for quick moeration would be a good solution.
__label__noRel	it is a great idea	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	the mod can even alert the authorities should they feel the hate speech warrants law enforcements	The best way to curb hate speech would be to have the comments section moderated for any forms of hate speech. In this manner people who have an opinion with substance can have a say in whatever article that was published.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	I agree	But what about those who were going to give positive comments. I believe comments should just be monitored
__label__noRel	Agreed, it's totally problematic once you start to censor opinion over simply bad language and obvious hate speech.	Just don't write about it
__label__noRel	good idea if the AI was reliable	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	I disagree, comments are how valid opinions are spread and change is made in the world. If there are no comments, there's no feedback.	I agree that it all should be reviewed before it is published
__label__noRel	you are very correct	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	I definitely agree	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	The comment section should be a safe where everyone is free to place their opinion and ask question without someone making them feel somehow about themselves.	i believe comment are important, to allow people to discuss. sometimes you can get factual information from other people comments
__label__noRel	reflecting on this, and the use of AI - here is a statement from Facebook about monitoring hate speech and now allowing these comments on the platform: https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/policies/community-standards/hate-speech/	I believe that people are allowed to express their opinions , that is why we have freedom of speech. However with that right, we are not subjected to hate speech, there are so many ways of expressing yourself without using offensive or hateful words. Considering a newspaper is a public platform, I believe everyone should try to be respective at all times. The comment space must not be removed, it helps to get insights of readers and is very helpful. I think the website should be enhanced in a way that it detects offensive language and doesn't allow the reader to continue if they use such. Also, comments should be monitored before being posted to the public.
__label__noRel	it removes the right of freedom of speech	By blocking comments with offensive words related to the topic, and banning individuals who constantly engage in hate speech.
__label__noRel	i agree	Companies aswell as the users should be liable and held accountable for allowing a platform to be used to share hate speech
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	I would almost agree that removing the comments would be beneficial. I've very rarely seen a comment on an article that actually contributed towards learning more about the content. It's typically just people yelling they don't agree without any true thought.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.

__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Comments should be regulated, but comment space should not be removed.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	Online comment spaces should be platforms promoting free speech, with some restrictions in place. Human or digital moderators (AI) could be used to identify comments and phrases constituting hate speech and remove them from the platform without hindering people's ability to share their authentic views.
__label__noRel	But the major newspapers are already owned by large corporations who have vested interest in political parties and financial matters. It is hard for liberal or independent news to break through the noise. Comments help to balance the conversation.	There absolutely are ways to facilitate healthy conversation and debates without allowing hate speech. Both algorithms and human moderation are ways to ensure debate can continue without resorting to abuse.
__label__noRel	Discriminatory words could be automatically blocked which will certainly reduce hate speech to some extent	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	All the posts should be checked before being posted and verified by some sort of AI. Hate speech could affect a person's livelihood and mental state
__label__noRel	true there are valid criticism that are necessary	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__noRel	It is true, there is freedom of speech, all readers should be able comment on what they think	There should be automatic filters but they are not 100, so there should also be a team of people constanly monitoring and reviewing complaints and reports. I feel like it is the only way to keep the freedom of speech but also protect people who might be victims of it.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it.

__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	They could force users to login and even if they chose to post annonymously, it can be flagged for hate speech and they can be banned from using the platform again.
__label__noRel	This may be challenging for newspaper websites with large audiences and therefore a great deal of traffic (which is a likely goal for most/all newspaper companies). The volume of new comments following a breaking story would likely be quite great and the task would very taxing for moderators. If the proportion of content that is hateful is quite high, you may be looking at quite a bit of burnout amongst the moderators who may quickly grow cynical, jaded, and emotionally exhausted from filtering out so much hatred and profanity.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	Moderation of the comments section
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	Research has shown that hate speech can be effectively controled since freedom of speech is not absolute
__label__noRel	This may negatively impact the public. As newspapers may publish news in a manner deceiving the truth and those who are not aware would believe lies.	I agree with your ideas. I think it still gives people a voice but without going too far
__label__noRel	I agree. As per 'The Free Speech Balancing Act of Digital Intermediaries: An explication of the concept of content governance' (Johnson, Brett (2015)' online news outlets face several competing duties: to promote free speech, to prevent harm, to obey the law, and to make money. Their entire business model relies on discourse and to prevent that is to deny readers/users the very service they claim to be providing. Some kind of voting system would allow harmful comments to be surpressed by the users themselves. It should really be left to the platforms themselves to figure out a way to manage potential hate speech (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00550-7#Sec4) through their own platforms as they have a responsibility to both limit harmful speech but keep discussion free and open.	There could also be a disclaimer added before one can see other comments which encourage readers to fact-check and be mindful of what they're reading, while also having moderators.

__label__noRel	Yes I agree, I feel that we are probably fairly used to sifting through the rubbish on the internet, and at times the trolls can be entertaining, as long as it isn't nasty.	There should be moderators of the discussion, people who use hate speech should be informed of what is problematic about their comments, comments should be deleted or they might be hidden but you can open them and read the moderators comments. If educating is not helping after first attempt, person should be restrcited form further discussion.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	I am unsure if there is a way to reduce hate speech. One persons 'hate speech' is anothers 'freedom of speech'. As a supposedly democratic nation, we need to be able to permit people from all walks of lives and experiences to air their own personal views, whether these are educated views or not.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	This should be a priority, some hate speech is not necessary
__label__noRel	They rob marginalized communities of their rights by being hateful, that doesn't get priority over the actual people facing violence as a result of their shitty actions.	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also

Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	Moderating comments is a far better method than eliminating comments entirely. I feel a method for reporting comments, though not perfect, is better, and then reported comments can be examined and removed if necessary.
__label__noRel	There must be some sort of check not censorship	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	I agree that free speech should be honoured and upheld. That being said, newspapers are their own entities that should have autonomy over their interactions and comments from readers. Therefore, I think the use of moderators, filtering out certain offensive language, and strict and visible posting guidelines are good ways to reduce hate speech on these websites.
__label__noRel	We live in a democratic country and so, everyone is entitled to their opinion.	Regulation of the newspaper comment section should be done. There should be moderators who have the ability to remove certain comments if they feel it is needed.
__label__noRel	true, but maybe they can remove anonymity so that everyone can be accountable for what they say.	pro
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	Comment space encourages discussion of important topics and allows free exchange of information and so should not be eliminated. Independent moderators should be used in order to ensure that hate speech is quickly deleted and encourage users to express their ideas without using inappropriate or aggressive language.
__label__noRel	the link provides usefull ways for people to deal with hate speech	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Hate speech is subjective and as such should not be censored.
__label__noRel	An idea doesn't have to be aggressive to be classed as hate speech. It could be dismissive or belittling, or just downright repugnant. Would you be happy to see Nazi opinions put forward in a happy, smiley way?	I don't think it's fair to eliminate comments from newspaper articles because the public is entitled to have their opinions heard. The best way to deal with hate speech is to moderate each comment before it is posted. Also the newspaper could ban accounts who engage in hate speech in the comments section. This moderation could be done through both human moderators and software to find trigger words signifying hate speech. It's important to democracy that citizens can have their say on the issues that affect their lives.
__label__noRel	Some people with genuine or kind comments may be put off interacting	I agree that moderating the comment section with flagged phrases that automatically send comments for quick moeration would be a good solution.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is often used as a reason not to have readers comments. It seems that this is not a fair argument for eliminating readers comments because of the psychological phenomenon of "cognitive dissonance" - we automatically search for echo chambers in any context.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__noRel	Agree, moderation is the way to go, as hate speech should not be part of any media forums.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	Fixing the root cause would be most beneficial.	Not allowing anonymous posts as well would force individuals to process comments internally before publishing on a public platform.
__label__noRel	By monitoring the comments, it will make decent people to enjoy the platform and it will make the website respectful	Discussion can be encouraged, but so often it leads to hate speech / one sided arguments. There needs to be a moderator in place to delete / hide certain comments, so free speech is allowed, but hate speech is not.

__label__noRel	Reduces the amount of troll comments	We need to create a society where we can debate with each other respectfully, we can know which platforms to use and not rile each other up without offending. It is widely suggested that education can address the extent of hate speech: https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/addressing-hate-speech-through-education-global-education-ministers-conference. However, this needs to go hand in hand with moderation of sites to ensure people are kept within reason. It is not a case of any one single solution.

__label__noRel	(sorry I mean one in ten)	Hate speech should not be allowed to dominate the narrative as it defeats the process and hinders effective communication. As a result, flagging and blocking of problematic accounts can prove to be effective in combating the spread of hate speech.
__label__noRel	Nothing	There should be hate speech words that should be used to warn the user and not allow them to post by disabling the post button if there are hate speech words.
__label__noRel	I agree with you, i feel like thats what media is about, expressing ourselves.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information.

__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	I think the first step to reducing hate speech in readers comments should be in the form of a moderation team in which they filter inappropriate comments. I think it should be a group of people rather than AI to do this to ensure all hate speech within a variety of contexts are eliminated, as if this was done by a computer there is risk of hate spilling through. For example, hate speech on the social media platform Twitter can often be missed as users purposefully misspell hateful speech to ensure it does not flag up on the AI searches, going as far as hateful language misspelt actually trending on Twitter.
__label__noRel	I agree with this comment sections can provide excellent reccomendations, for example: https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/oct/20/steely-dans-20-greatest-songs-ranked	It may be a good idea to involve some form of moderators to check if there are any hate speeches. Aggressive comments may be censored accordingly. However, we need to be careful in doing this as some may have negative effect as silencing voices.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Maybe the only solution is to remove the space for comments? We see the same issues on other platforms that allow comments!
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	This is not just a newspaper comment section problem... it's a social media problem as well, more like an internet problem. We need way to not push people away, but educate them. Because the truth is, nobody starts out as a hater but radicaliz ation can happen to anyone. check https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P55t6eryY3g
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__noRel	AI is a great option that would reduce the need for manpower and increase the efficiency and speed in which hate speech is addressed.	Newspaper comment spaces allow people the opportunity to share their opinions and feel that they can contribute their thoughts and ideas - it can also help readers engage with the content in a different way.

__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	Take a few minutes to breathe, meditate, and physically calm your body down before you start typing your response.

__label__noRel	That could help, although that would take a long of time. Also at the end of the day, whoever writes hateful speech do not see the dangers of what they are doing. According to an article in The Guardian, some people think this is just the internet and it does not reflect true life.	hate speech online will always be there and we shouldn't focus on hate speech a lo because there will be a lot of positive comments
__label__noRel	I feel like we somehow need to be a little bit more specific on which tools could work, because many times it could also be difficult to set limits in what can be said and what not.

The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.

Readers should be able to comment but be informed of certain comments that would be considered hate speech.

__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	Allow users to report comments.
__label__noRel	That's not true, there are millions of platforms to hold conversation about news articles without talking directly under them. Everything they right is open to public scrutiny.

Although hate comments may not initially cause any physical harm, the psychological damage caused by hate comments is bad enough and can eventually lead to physical damage too.

It would be smart to rather monitor comments to ensure hate speech or utterances of a vile nature are greatly reduced through the use of some sort of algorithm that picks up on problematic words and deletes comments or it being done manually by people who will moderate the comment section.
__label__noRel	this will reduce cyberbullying	I agree with some other opinions on the use of A1 to flag or censor certain words that constitute hate or violent speech. It would also be beneficial to have a human supervisor from the organisation and another external body review the activities of the AI to ensure accuracy and consistency.
__label__noRel	This would reduce hate speech and overall help to ensure a promote positive environment	I think that the introduction of moderators to remove any hate speech would be beneficial. Perhaps the introduction of guidelines as to what constitutes permitted negative comments.
__label__noRel	the cons at the moment of the comments with the public are that they are not checked for swearing, name calling etc	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	The newspapers will not get to know how people realy feel about the issue at hand if the comment space is closed. The dialogue will be one sided	By monitoring individual responses and removing those not deemed suitable for publication
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	We do need to have balance in an argument and allow for free speech to enable all views to be heard and a common good found.	as long as good moderators are in place, hate speech and disrespectful comments will be weeded out.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	It is true that it would be difficult to remove and control all of the comments however i think it would be a lot more damaging to remove the right to freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	It would save people wasting time leaving unecessary comments on often trivial matters. Its like people who ring up the radio, most people dont bother or care. Those who do are usually idiots or have more extreme opinions.	It hink a moderation is required for hate speech. Removing the entire comment section is not an ideal option. However, hate speech is alsoa crime. It is clear that there should be some monitoring in social media in terms of tracking down the user when necessary so similar terms with the real world would be valid. If you make a crime in real word you get you will stand trial so similar option should be valid for social media.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	The best way to curb hate speech would be to have the comments section moderated for any forms of hate speech. In this manner people who have an opinion with substance can have a say in whatever article that was published.
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	I think it is part of the responsibility of having a website. If the newspaper is not listed as a +18 platform for using insults or hate speech, then young people would be affected.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	agreed. no one body/company should be given that much power. dialogue and transparency is the cornerstone of any democracy	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	I agree	A pop-up can be used which reads "if any 'hate speech' comment is discovered, it will be removed from these comments".
__label__noRel	I believe ALL websites with ANY content are responsible for the messages their content conveys - be it articles, podcasts, videos or comments.	we need to stop coment section
__label__noRel	people should be able to have an opinion, but without monitoring people would be offended all the time and thing could escalate very quickly.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Hate speech can be positive criticism and essential in some posts, altgough it can be offensive and totally uncalled for in other posts. A way in which social media apps regulate and monitor the comments, otherwise people have rights to freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	With every right comes responsibly so your right cannot impose on others	I think this is a task that is hard to do because it has to be done in a way that would not hinder freedom of speech but at the same time not attack people. Thus, I think comments should be flagged depending on the words used but not be deleted until it has been checked.
__label__noRel	Agreed. Education is so important, without education I know I and some of my friends would not be as understanding about others, it is a really important part of life and being able to be educated is a major step to stopping this.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__noRel	Time	Hate speech is not a criticsm and should be avoided
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Hire moderators and similar positions, and also having filtering systems
__label__noRel	I don't agree with removing the space for views to be aired. That is an important part of challenging and changing opinion. I agree that hate speech should not be tolerated so finding the users and punishing them is key.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	I think having moderators who check the comments and remove any that contain hate speech is the best way of reducing it.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.

__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	I don't think we can police websites 100% but if comments are moderated I think we can reach quite a high degree of compliance
__label__noRel	This is a great idea balances everything	Hate speech is subjective and as such should not be censored.
__label__noRel	But there is a major difference between " white people should die" and "I have a dislike towards the white race are statistically more	Could ensure moderation of commonly used words for hate speech, and frequent moderation on these websites
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	i think a law should be made that if you do not delete hate speech from your website or article than that newspaper will have to pay a fine.
__label__noRel	https://mediaengagement.org/research/journalists-and-online-comments/	I agree that discussions should be moderated. But what happens when the moderators themselves are biased?
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	I think hate speech is always going to be a problem unfortunately, and although websites can monitor comments and remove any hate speech what ultimately is needed is teaching people there are better ways to get their opinions across and better use of freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I agree with this comment. I really would encourage people to educate other people about the consequences and reasons behind hate speech. These factors might contribute to reduce it	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	I agree. Children should be taught in schools the value to expressing their opinions but also the difference in expressing and opinion and spreading hate.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	stops others from feeling they can also be mean	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	This works if the media had some guidelines to go by, otherwise everyone's level of what would be allowed would be different.	I think through fair moderation, then the amount of hate speech will be reduced.
__label__noRel	i dont think being able to use hate speech, racist/homophobic language	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	This article summarises it well https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation	This is not just a newspaper comment section problem... it's a social media problem as well, more like an internet problem. We need way to not push people away, but educate them. Because the truth is, nobody starts out as a hater but radicaliz ation can happen to anyone. check https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P55t6eryY3g
__label__noRel	Its true that the old way we used to read newspapers were without comments so we should just do that now online to stop all the hate speech.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	And we will get to keep our respectful viewers who knows that you still have disagreement without insulting others	i do not agree with the method of doxxing people. hate speech has always existed, it is now on a more global scale because the world is more centralised as a result of social media. i believe the solution is censorship and moderation which sites like reddit and youtube already preactise.
__label__noRel	Moderators need to act quickly to remove any hate speech	Completely doing away with the comment section would not be beneficial to the readers experience as reading other peoples thoughts is what sets online media apart from offline media.

__label__noRel	The newspaper should also boost positive messages of tolerance.	People should be told about hate speech and how it affects other people and I think people who participate in hate speech should have some sort of panishment.
__label__noRel	I agree, public debate is good.	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	There needs to be proper moderation of comments so that no hate speech slips through the net. This would make more work for the newspapers but would only require one person to constantly monitor what is being submitted and only allow reasonable comments.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	readers comments be moderated and anything that is harmful, hateful or hurtful should be removed. this allows people to exercise their right of freedom of speech but limiting the harm that someones opinion may have
__label__noRel	I agree as many news papers in our days don't have comment sections as it is expensive and time consuming	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	However it should be note that the AI should not be programmed with inherant biases of the programmer(s)	Websites should invest in software to remove hate speech, this would allow for healthy debate without racist or descrimination.
__label__noRel	Newspapers should be neutral, but you find that they are often the ones who actually instigate hate speech	AI could be used to flag hate speech, meaning comments that are hate speech can be flagged at the time. The tech needs more work though based on this article: https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/04/1025742/ai-hate-speech-moderation/
__label__noRel	I would agree that a moderator system would be a better choice than removing the comments.	flag all the comments that contain vulgar words and warn the sender. the comment must be rephrased, failure to do so must result in the suspension of the sender from commenting
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	Flag known and "popular" derogatory terms automatically through the platform which does not allow you to post the comment without using the politically correct terms
__label__noRel	An algorithm in itself can be bias and discrimatory as proven by studies, it also may not take into consideration different languages	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	I found this really interesting, "Khan said the freedom of opinion and expression, including the right to seek, receive and disseminate diverse sources of information, must be upheld by States in times of crises and armed conflict as a precious ‘survival right’ on which people’s lives, health, safety, security and dignity depend." This is similar to what lots of people have been saying regarding worrying that this sort of censorhip could overextend.

__label__noRel	It would have the advantage of searching out offensive words prior to them actually being printed and could be stopped before they are.	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	This sums up how detrimental hate speech could be	Ban those who consistent ly abuse hate speech
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Hate speech is subjective and as such should not be censored.
__label__noRel	people may still use illegal identification or find a way past the barriers	I think comments give the ability to the users to express their opinion on what is described in the articles and this is an important rule for democracy. Removing the ability to comment in my view is basically limiting free speech. I also believe that user do not need necessarily to be identifiable, being anonymous is fine as long as they respect others and their opinions.
__label__noRel	I agree. In most cases people often react out of anger or disappointment, sometimes even without fully comprehending what is being said which I feel is the reason for some hate speech.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	Removing hate speech comments is also not a good thing because with the technology that we have, people will go and create fake accounts and still go back to comment hatefully and disrespecting words of which it will be a daunting task to delete all the comments
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	Commenters should agree to abide by all rules when signing up to the website and he banned for breaking the rules. Also all submitted comments must be thoroughly checked for negative for flagged words or topics. Also I think it would reduce the chances of this happening if users could not reply to each other or comment on others opinions. It's about each users initial opinion on a certain subject and less about judging others opinions on what they think!!!!
__label__noRel	I agree with you, online privacy is already a massive issue, I don't want to have to submit even more personal data (that could end up sold to advertisers) just to comment on an article. I also don't think 'tracking down' people who post hate speech online is practical or achievable.	https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons
__label__noRel	Less people expressing there hate online does not mean that hate crimes will decrease in numbers. It will be just harder to prosecute people	some people "troll" by writing inflammatory remarks, but it is fundamental to a free society to have free discussion. Any attempts at calling something "hate speech" will be only about stopping anything that goes against the narratives of the rich establishment.
__label__noRel	I'm not very sure that an automated system is the answer. There are many cases of false positives, particularly when other users attempt to have a discussion with the offender. The machine picks up on keywords used commonly in hate speech and the users attempting a discussion may use these keywords as well.	I have read through some of the cooments and my stance is still the same. It is no doubt that hate speech is a problem, however, not allowing the public the opportunity to comment on issues may not only be a problem against freedom of speech, it may also cause the newspaper to lose some of its loyal readers if they're not able to engage with the content shared by the newspaper.
__label__noRel	Unfortunately people will always exist that are hateful	in my opinion there should be no comment section , article should be true and commenting no needed
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	I think an AI that could identify some keyword related with hate speech would be helpful to flag that comment and allow further review
__label__noRel	Hateful comments should allow respondents to persuade otherwise. Comments can be a good force for change and shouldn't be cancelled.	I think the best way is to block or censor certain words. Especially words that are synonymous with hate speech. Or better yet, have moderators in comments sections.
__label__noRel	yes. the website can simply have words that are not accepted in the comments. this can minimize or eliminate hate speech altogether	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	I think there should a program that verify the comment before they are displayed on the newpaper
__label__noRel	No comments means less moderator headaches and potential to offend	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	By utilising AI so that it can look for certain words that could be deemed offensive.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	It seems like many users think that having your personally details posted along with your comment would be a deterrent for people to comment hate speech

__label__noRel	Moderators are useful but they will have their own bias and we cannot guarntee that they will be impartial, thus we remain in the same position	There is a fine line between freedom of speech and hate. And hate can be interpreted differently for different people causing biased censorship. Therefore newspapers should have moderators from both sides of opinion that overlook comments to approve before they are published
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted.

Source: https://netino.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/WAN-IFRA_Online_Commenting.pdf (pg 7)
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	We need to block the users that use hate speech and filter the comments that have any form of hate speech.
__label__noRel	How do you propose to address the root causes?	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	This is unlikely to be feasible. United states courts have repeatedly upheld a right to anonymity in this context: https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/why-ending-anonymity-would-not-make-social-media-better.php	by rigorous moderating of the comments section or by implementing a bot that flags key hate words
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	Although it might be unfair for others, I think majority can agree that removing the comment section will be helpful because then it means anyone that has an opinion can rather call the newspaper.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks.

__label__noRel	Sometimes, the vocal minority are the ones which are giving the hate speech, having a system allows a voice for those who don't want to speak	I think that readers who use hate speech should be reported and temporarily banned from the site, as I believe that we need comments section in online newspaper articles. It is important to share your views as we have freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Algorithms are not always accurate	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	We live in a democratic society and so people have the right to their opinions. They just need to be voiced in the right way
__label__noRel	how do you regulate what hate speech is and who by?	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	people naturally get angry so its difficult to reduce hate speech without any group being offended to some distinction	The only possible way to reduce hate speech is to have some kind of algorithm that may recognise certain words and phrases. Other than that it would mean moderating the comment section.
__label__noRel	Yeah. That's true anyway. Freedom of speech is good but protecting the citizens and preventing violence through hate speech is also great	Hate speech is something people intentionally and so if people continue to participate in it, they should be punished.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	Filter comments or have a ban on words that come across as hateful.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	The use of a system that detect hate speech before publishing
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	No contribution to the general debate.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	Its ok to have some negative comments as long as they are balanced and not offensive or personal	There should be some level of censoring to eliminate hate speech, but not to the extent where comments are totally disabled
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	Definitely, it can be very polarising in itself with a definition and cause more issue if the wrong thing is removed	Hate speech must be banned totally from the online publications.
__label__noRel	Moderators will allow for fair reviiews	I'd happily see all comments sections removed for the good of the public in general. Nobody needs to know that Tony from Bognor thinks All Them Lot Should Go Home, because Tony is a twat who shouldn't be given a platform.
__label__noRel	one way would be to not let and comments be published until a moderator has checked each comment.	Discussion can be encouraged, but so often it leads to hate speech / one sided arguments. There needs to be a moderator in place to delete / hide certain comments, so free speech is allowed, but hate speech is not.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	Alternatively I'd offer the opinion that goes against the question and states that we shouldn't offer a space for readers comments (and thus hate speech) at all on news since it's primarily a site and source for news. Systems like https://ground.news/ have been providing news and removing bias without a social aspect already and since third party social/sharing/commentary sites handle discussion and the problem of hate speech far better than newspaper websites presumably can hope to, the solution seems intuitive: remove it and let that happen organically on other websites and platforms.
__label__noRel	They rob marginalized communities of their rights by being hateful, that doesn't get priority over the actual people facing violence as a result of their shitty actions.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Aggression is a subjective aspect. Someone may be expressing themselves passionately, but is seen as aggressive. Cultural differences and misinterpretation of words and intent can also influence opinion of a comment's 'aggression'.	I think there has to be a system that can verify whether a person's comment contains hate speech and if it is found to contain hate speech, that person should not be allowed to leave the comment.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	block swearing, abusive, discrimatory words- freedom of speech without rasicism, name calling etc
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Although it would be fair to allow for both critical and positive input, I believe that newspaper websites should have a mechanism in place that can identify hate speech and restrict individuals who use it. This would prevent readers from freely using hate speech.
__label__noRel	If they give source to backup their views. That is good as you can verify it though the site could be bias.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	https://www.un.org/youthenvoy/2017/02/unesco-addresses-youth-radicalization-online-hate-speech-nice-conference/	I found this really interesting, "Khan said the freedom of opinion and expression, including the right to seek, receive and disseminate diverse sources of information, must be upheld by States in times of crises and armed conflict as a precious ‘survival right’ on which people’s lives, health, safety, security and dignity depend." This is similar to what lots of people have been saying regarding worrying that this sort of censorhip could overextend.

__label__noRel	Not allowing them to be anynymous might probably discourage some good-intentioned people to comment as well.	I was completely taken aback by some strong stances to remove the comment space, and the belief in that because Newspapers should be one-sided providers. I would disagree because newspaper share societal information and society should be allowed to engage and be part of the conversation instead of just consuming whatever information is being released for consumption. It has been seen as a result of other newspaper websites removing the comment section that it reduces the trust of the reader because they are aware of the bias of the information they are consuming, and also it reduces the amount of time readers spend on these sites because there is no community engagements.

__label__noRel	Hate speech is a nonsense concept.	Could ensure moderation of commonly used words for hate speech, and frequent moderation on these websites
__label__noRel	Agreed, more understanding and education are always good for society. Moderation functions as a good intermediary for discussion.	Have something that sensors specific hate words and filter them out
__label__noRel	This works in terms of removing literal slurs from the platform, but doesn't account for when hate speech is more well-disguised or nebulous - how could we expect an automatic system to understand a dogwhistle?	I think an AI that could identify some keyword related with hate speech would be helpful to flag that comment and allow further review
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	The most effective way would be to produce effective and fair algorithms that can detect use of hate speech along with help of human moderation.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	If we need other peoples opinions before we can form our own then we are literally just looking for confirmation bias of what we already believe	As I saw some commentary on this platform, my opinion is that we need 2 things. A submission of personal data before one can have access to post anything related and real time moderation of the comments. Big platforms like YouTube, Instagram and others are held accountable for their users' actions and they have had a lot of success so far.

__label__noRel	I agree, because not all comments will be hate speech, some are positive.	We can reduce hate speech by having it moderated
__label__noRel	That would reduce hate speech	1st position: comments on newspaper articles should not be allowed
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	Removing the comment section will only create a bigger revolt and uprise from people that write hate speech, and it will move to another media outlets. So the problem should be treated not silenced it. It is the responsibility of newspapers websites to police hate speech in order to create a safe environment for an healthy discussion about a news article. Otherwise you are cutting short an experience that users might want to have. So by censoring all the comment section your make erverybody pay a price for something that they haven't done. Moderation is the key and should be done my the newspapers websites according to the values they have.
__label__noRel	I agree	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__noRel	What about peoples right to freely express themselves on platforms	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I agree. Children should be taught in schools the value to expressing their opinions but also the difference in expressing and opinion and spreading hate.	I feel like there are certain topics for which disabling comments is the best option. For example extremely sensitive stories about severe crimes or ones that involve children.
__label__noRel	More understanding	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	It may be a good idea to involve some form of moderators to check if there are any hate speeches. Aggressive comments may be censored accordingly. However, we need to be careful in doing this as some may have negative effect as silencing voices.
__label__noRel	Sometimes, the vocal minority are the ones which are giving the hate speech, having a system allows a voice for those who don't want to speak	We can fairly reduce hate speech from newspapers websites without eliminating space for readers comments by encouraging people to give a reward who will comment without hate speech.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Agreeing with others here: a standard of moderation would have to be communicated to the user, with straightforward policies of flagging or reporting potentially hateful comments. A synthesis of live and algorithmic moderators might be best, as certain words can be auto-flagged for review, whereas other things might involve a more delicate touch.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	In as much as we can not let the spread of hate speech continue, closing the comment section is not the solution. The newspaper website should have the option for readers to be able to report comments that include hate speech and moderators should be appointed to check "users" that are violating the rules. There can be filters in place that remove posts that have some of the common hateful and derogatory phrases. outlining the rules and regulations for the website users can help

__label__noRel	I have to disagree with this, as giving an opinion that is opposite to the other person's opinion is completely different that using hate speech to deliver the message. You can have free speech and hate speech banning at the same time working together. Using AI to spot hatespeech keywords, while still allowing people to argue and have different opinions, as long as they aren't doing it the wrong way.	1. Only allow verified accounts to post - these accounts should be easily traced back to individuals. 2. Moderate comments with both algorithms and human visibility. 3. Prosecute.

__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.

I dont think it is a fair choice. For how long should people be silenced. Hate speech is always going to be around. Shutting people up is not going to stop hate speech.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	By putting in a classing program that will read and class information as it enters. That way things will work nicely and we wont see more of hate speech

__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	A hate speech detecting service as discussed in the following article could be the answer to this problem.https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-for-hate-speech-detection-a-large-scale-empirical-evaluation-92831ded6bb6	I think the best option would be to put some moderators that are educated about hateful speeches and let them see comments before they are online so that they can decide to approved them or not. They are doing it in Germany (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793)

__label__noRel	I agree with this. They are quite good nowdays and can be used accurately to spot mature language	I think that readers who use hate speech should be reported and temporarily banned from the site, as I believe that we need comments section in online newspaper articles. It is important to share your views as we have freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	certain words that are flagged as hate speech should be removed	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.

__label__noRel	The comments need to hidden from the public comments and get approved to be viewed in online newspaper website.	Someone should monitor the chat, and those who use hate speech should be given 1 warning before being removed from the website.
__label__noRel	If comments are present they should not be regulated. People should not allow themselves to be personally offended by the opinions of others. People have a right to their own beliefs and opinions.	A possible way to address hate speech on newspaper sites would be to incorporate both human moderators and some sort of AI that monitors for hateful words and comments. The requirement to submit personally identifying information before commenting might also help because without this then anyone can create a fake name that hides the person's true identity so therefore more likely to engage in hate speech. If personal information is required, then hate speech would be less likely.
__label__noRel	Hate speech must be controlled in some how.	You can let people create an account with a full name so they will have to think more about what they write and can't so easily spew hate
__label__noRel	That will take too long time to do manually, so it's best to ban some words in the start. If the user is using to many of the banned words, then ban the user automatically.	not all stories need people to add their opinions sothat should ease the pressure on moderators

__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way.

It means keeping hate speech from escalating into something more dangerous, particularly incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence, which is prohibited under international law. https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech
__label__noRel	WHile the definition in general can apply to most types of hate speech, there is one flaw, which can be illustrated by the following statement: "I don't care about your race, religion or gender. I do not like you because you are an idiot (or stupid)". Is that hate speech or an expression of opinion?	Overall I think I agree with some of the mentions that removing the comments section does reduce freedom of speech. We should be allowed to comment and share opinions on any topic as long as it isn't hate speech.

__label__noRel	Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but opinions that are built around criticism of ones work do not benefit an ybody	Alternatively I'd offer the opinion that goes against the question and states that we shouldn't offer a space for readers comments (and thus hate speech) at all on news since it's primarily a site and source for news. Systems like https://ground.news/ have been providing news and removing bias without a social aspect already and since third party social/sharing/commentary sites handle discussion and the problem of hate speech far better than newspaper websites presumably can hope to, the solution seems intuitive: remove it and let that happen organically on other websites and platforms.

__label__noRel	I actually agree that eliminating the space for conversation on polarizing topics can reduce extremist echo chambers sometimes. Though they often move to other platforms that have zero regulations to hold that conversation when they can't have it where they saw something. Which increases the odds of being stuck in a hateful echo chamber.	By a combination of monitoring and blocking people who leave such comments, and also having suitable laws in place to back this up
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	First, it would be important to define what hate speech is so that readers that want to post comments have a chance to self-modify their posts. Secondly, having a filter that will automatically block posts that contain proscribed words could also help to reduce the amount of hate speech featured in comments sections.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.

__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	But have you considered which one has more serious effects and consequences? I think that should be guiding in the main argument on whether to allow commenting or allow hate speech	Freedom of speech can be used as catch-all term to justify the use and propagation of bigoted and hateful language. If we accept that some language is not acceptable due to it's clearly hateful nature then we have to acknowledge that some form of censorship of those particular instances has to occur. I would suggest that eliminating all such spaces from newspaper websites would have a massive detrimental effect on valid, non-bigoted, freedom of speech a cornerstone of western life. We don't ban all cars because some people speed dangerously, we monitor the roads and ban the bad drivers. I suggest that as long as readers comments are monitored continually they should remain.

__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	I know this has been discussed a few times potentially in reply to comments but I'd like to repeat it again: language is complex and you can't simply ban or flag certain terms or phrases and think you catch all the hate speech comments etc. While a report button and the use of a software that can support a human moderator is in essence a good idea, it might also delete comments that do not actually contain HS or completely miss others overall. I think this decision by the newspaper turned into an entire discussion of manageability of monitoring discussion sections and away from the ethical considerations.
__label__noRel	It is the best solution	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	Algorithms are a must to cut out hate speech. Allowing only paying subscribers is elitist but necessary as being traceable is important.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Having certain words being banned or marked as inappropriate might help reduce hate speech. Systems that moderate what is being said and shared and the option to report hate speech might be helpful.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	There needs to be a fine balance between freedom of expression and stopping hate speech. The best way is for comments to be screened as that would still allow opinions to be shared while ensuring the safety of all readers
__label__noRel	This should prevent the majority of hate speech to be eliminated.	My final argument is that it is possible to monitor and reduce hate speech on website comments by using both AI and human intelligence
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	people feel powerful behind an anonymous account, its easier to say things you would never normally say under the guise of anonymity, if it was easier to link a comment to who it came from and if people actually faced consequences from posting hate then this could help stop it.
__label__noRel	I do believe that removing the comment section is the right thing to do. even though some may see it as restricting free speech	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	I think that keeping a comment section is overall good as it keeps engagement but needs to be heavily moderated and regulated so it doesn't just dissolve into a lot of hate speech and grounds for radicalisation
__label__noRel	I think with people reading less newspapers both hard copy and online, Print subscription circulations have fallen by 7% over the past two years, from 125 million overall to 116 million, while single-copy sales are down 11%, from 3.2 million in the first half of 2019 to 2.8 million in the first half of this year.17 Dec 2021, the papers are not going to give the time and effort to monitor the comments sections when there's nothing in it for them.	I am reminded while discussing this of the way Daily Mail in UK handles the comments section. It just mentions on top of the comments page that theses comments are not moderated.So it allows everybody to express their opionion. This is how it should be done in my opinion
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.

__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	I think this is a task that is hard to do because it has to be done in a way that would not hinder freedom of speech but at the same time not attack people. Thus, I think comments should be flagged depending on the words used but not be deleted until it has been checked.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	I think the first step to reducing hate speech in readers comments should be in the form of a moderation team in which they filter inappropriate comments. I think it should be a group of people rather than AI to do this to ensure all hate speech within a variety of contexts are eliminated, as if this was done by a computer there is risk of hate spilling through. For example, hate speech on the social media platform Twitter can often be missed as users purposefully misspell hateful speech to ensure it does not flag up on the AI searches, going as far as hateful language misspelt actually trending on Twitter.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is often used as a reason not to have readers comments. It seems that this is not a fair argument for eliminating readers comments because of the psychological phenomenon of "cognitive dissonance" - we automatically search for echo chambers in any context.
__label__noRel	Does not allow for positive feedback	My position as a reader and my argument is that bases on the rules of speech people have freedom of speech and expression. That should be done in a proper way without insulting others or hating or being racist in your speech. Websites and newspapers should not remove the comments of the people responding to hate speech. This is done according to the rules found in the following article: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230
__label__noRel	If you disagree with how they run their websites, run your own website.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	so	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed

__label__noRel	It is important to actually define what hate speech is before an agreed education policy can be enacted.	Although it might be unfair for others, I think majority can agree that removing the comment section will be helpful because then it means anyone that has an opinion can rather call the newspaper.

__label__noRel	Reasonable advice	Implementing a software that detects comments including hate speech, like the ones on social networks. Also including a report button for poeple to report hate speech comments
__label__noRel	People may not freely divulge what they actually think if they know they can be tracked down and "re-educated"!	Completely removing the comment section is out of the question.

__label__noRel	Yes, I agree 100% with this as the impacts of hate speech and cyberbullying can be detrimental to the person. https://www.youthranch.org/blog/social-media-dangers-and-the-effects-of-cyberbullying	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	I tend to agree.	Space on comments is a must have because many users get to participate into a good course that could help many others and therefore those spewing hate should be harshly dealt with. Blocked actively so
__label__noRel	Newspapers are not supposed to be one-sided in the first place; they're supposed to give all the information, which will include different viewpoints by nature to avoid bias. This seems like a slippery-slope to accepting journalists' opinions as fact.	we need to stop coment section
__label__noRel	I feel they do have a responsibility to monitor trolling and abusive behaviour as this can be harmful to others. A modern legal test of the legitimacy of proposed restrictions on freedom of speech was stated in the opinion by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. in Schenk v. U.S. (1919): a restriction is legitimate only if the speech in question poses a “clear and present danger”—i.e., a risk or threat to safety or to other public interests that is serious and imminent.	Increasing the monitoring of comments made on a post will prevent the propagation of dangerous viewpoints and scams performed on people as no control over the content published create spaces for this to take place.
__label__noRel	Evidence shows that it is more likely to be a constructive discussion on the newspaper website rather than on Facebook (which is where it would end up if you removed the comments section)	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	I think people need to be educated more on hate speech and better ways to get their points across.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	If comments that create hate speech are removed/moderated, you can not complain about loss of freedom of speech as you are then being discrimantory, rather than speaking freely, and there is a difference.
__label__noRel	agree. It is also well documented that it can be harmful. A modern legal test of the legitimacy of proposed restrictions on freedom of speech was stated in the opinion by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. in Schenk v. U.S. (1919): a restriction is legitimate only if the speech in question poses a “clear and present danger”—i.e., a risk or threat to safety or to other public interests that is serious and imminent.	Reduce hate speech by screening out certain words. If a comment contains such words, it is deleted or hidden from public view
__label__noRel	However a view point can be expressed appropriately as a constructive criticism by the target audience. Therefore you could argue that anyone who engages in hate speech is the wrong audience.	Moderation is key. Plenty of newspapers and online media are able to keep comments open with a bit of moderation.
__label__noRel	I agree, this is a very measured resoonse.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public.

__label__noRel	But hate speech hurts. We can't let it just run rife because it's "too hard" to address.	By outright banning IP addresses which contribute hate speech to platforms, and investing in moderation through human resources and through text analysis tools.
__label__noRel	Not so much swearing and negativity.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	comments can dilute the validity of the story	Even though I am generally curious to read other people's comments, I think the best would actually be to eliminate comments altogether, or restrict to the way paper news work, i.e. you can write a letter and they might publish it next time.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	I think using a platform which blocks out certain words, kind of like a filter would help. So if someone made a post with a certain word in, that post would not be made public, instead the comment would be flagged and go to a admin, who can read the comment and then decide if the 'bot' which flagged it was correct or not, and then deciding if to allow the post to be made or not
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.

__label__noRel	People should be entitled to share opinions.	I feel that all users should provide true identification that can be used if they use hate speech to find them/report them.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Ensuring there are rules to adhere to, perhaps muting certain offensive words or phrases. Making sure commnect sections are heavily monitored.
__label__noRel	This may work	The website must have words that are automatically marked as unacceptable. whenever those words are included in a comment, the website must privately warn the sender and not allow the comment to go through until the comment is rephrased correctly and politely.
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	By a combination of monitoring and blocking people who leave such comments, and also having suitable laws in place to back this up
__label__noRel	more moderation	Moderating comments is a far better method than eliminating comments entirely. I feel a method for reporting comments, though not perfect, is better, and then reported comments can be examined and removed if necessary.
__label__noRel	100% correct	i agree that people have the right to express their own ideas but you have to be considerate otherwise it can easily be interpreted as hate if your not careful with wordings.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	Removing the comment section all together is a fair point as news is meant to be fair and impartial. People share their opinions based on their biases and that's not what the news is for - that's what social media is for. But in this case allowing the comment section to remain would be great if people would not abuse the power to share freely by sharing hate speech and slander. us as humans need to be regulated by a set of rules in order to keep a functioning society and i think a filtered comment section is the solution.
__label__noRel	Slow process. Subject to flaws if misinterpreted by moderators/other commenters.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	some words should be muted or not allowed to be used in newspapers, because they are offensive or they contribute to hate speech	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Always a question of who guards the guardians	having a team that moderates the comments beforehand is a good idea.do not post comments that have hate speech.
__label__noRel	i think people do need to vent,this is a safe way to do so	It is a tricky one to get the balance correct. There will always be some people in society who are happy to spout nonsense/hatred online as they sit behind a keyboard. At the same time, there will also be people who wish to share their more sensible and respectful views on topics.
__label__noRel	I support the filtering of comments instead of removing the comment section. A filtering systems should be put in place	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	Beneficial to the masses.	I know this has been discussed a few times potentially in reply to comments but I'd like to repeat it again: language is complex and you can't simply ban or flag certain terms or phrases and think you catch all the hate speech comments etc. While a report button and the use of a software that can support a human moderator is in essence a good idea, it might also delete comments that do not actually contain HS or completely miss others overall.

__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	lts true hate speech should be taken as positive criticism
__label__noRel	But what if the opinion of others infringes upon the rights of another. As much as we should all be able to express our opinion it shouldn't be at the expense of others.	The best thing would be to have some sort of app that monitors and regulate the language used. in a case where hate speech is found in a comment, the sentence should be blurred out.
__label__noRel	I agree with Dominic , who becomes judge of what is true, what is without bias, what is hateful versus what is simply disagree, disapprove, dislike. Do we say happy things only and simply create artifical safe spaces where only positive ego boosting comments are allowed?	have an admin or moderator remove inappropriate comments.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	This will go against the purpose of public opinion. Public opinion is informative and sometimes educational	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	In the digital world we live in - unfortunately hate speech is part and parcel of the benefits of having such an open forum and allowing everyone to have a voice. Hate speech is made by a minuscule minority of people. Perhaps have a 'report hate speech' button that members of the community can use.

__label__noRel	Hate speech is called hate speech for a reason. ALso it is not protected under the guise of freedom of speech.

__label__noRel	When moderators have to approve all comments before they get posted you might create an environment where comments the moderator does not agree with do not get posted at all. The better option in my opinion would the second one where you allow readers to flag inappropriate comments, together with a moderator team reviewing these comments. In that case there is a public consensus and more transparency.	i agree that people have the right to express their own ideas but you have to be considerate otherwise it can easily be interpreted as hate if your not careful with wordings.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it.

Blocking all comments infringes on free speech and does not allow readers to provide a counterpoint to the position provided in the article.
__label__noRel	may stop people being 'keyboard warriors' and hiding behind a screen	Hire moderators and similar positions, and also having filtering systems
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	i do not agree with the method of doxxing people. hate speech has always existed, it is now on a more global scale because the world is more centralised as a result of social media. i believe the solution is censorship and moderation which sites like reddit and youtube already preactise.
__label__noRel	I also believe that educating one another is very important in trying to reduce hate speech.	Someone should monitor the chat, and those who use hate speech should be given 1 warning before being removed from the website.

__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it.

__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	It is true that it would be difficult to remove and control all of the comments however i think it would be a lot more damaging to remove the right to freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	I still think a filtering system of removing categorically hateful words could help a little, but there is still the big problem of other comments bypassing that. I think an independant and unbiased moderation team could help to remove the issue of the newspapers removing valid critisism or comments about inaccurate reporting for example.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	Rarely some very sensitive articles should be allowed to switch off comments sector.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	I think people should be encouraged to give personal comments however they need to be monitored to ensure hate speech cannot be seen which might negatively impact others
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	By flagging certain vocabulary which relates to hate speech and once this is flogged, the person commenting is blocked from posting their view. We would need to look at ways of getting around mispellings of the words though, as people could use this to get past the AI.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	There is no need to reduce hate speech, we just need to accept it. Banning or reducing hate speech is just censorship which is not acceptable.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	I have already said that people who have already displayed hate speech on a website should be banned from giving their opinion.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	Comment space encourages discussion of important topics and allows free exchange of information and so should not be eliminated. Independent moderators should be used in order to ensure that hate speech is quickly deleted and encourage users to express their ideas without using inappropriate or aggressive language.
__label__noRel	Do not stop free speech, filter out hate speech!	By simply monitoring the comments and blocking the negative ones and removing them
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Ensuring there are rules to adhere to, perhaps muting certain offensive words or phrases. Making sure commnect sections are heavily monitored.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	It is important for people to voice their opions so I do not thik this discussion is fair, however I do agree that comments should be moderated. The readers should also be made aware of the rules that apply to commenting with regards to hateful speech.

__label__noRel	I agree	We need to be very clear about what constitutes hate speech and create severe punishments for those that spread it.
__label__noRel	I'm not convinced this is a helpful input in its own way.	Have moderators who constantly monitor and remove hateful posts or ones that are inciting others/goading others.
__label__noRel	I agree, there are currently no online hate speech statistics available due to a lack of means to report hate speech: https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/what-is-online-hate-crime/	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	while I do agree with this, it makes me sad that our society is so soured that people cannot use self control	You can moderate and that way delete hate speech. This won't get rid of freedom of speech but gets rid of discrimination etc https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech
__label__noRel	Straight out of the WEF. No thanks.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	I agree with some other opinions on the use of A1 to flag or censor certain words that constitute hate or violent speech. It would also be beneficial to have a human supervisor from the organisation and another external body review the activities of the AI to ensure accuracy and consistency.
__label__noRel	Agreed. Education is so important, without education I know I and some of my friends would not be as understanding about others, it is a really important part of life and being able to be educated is a major step to stopping this.	Some of the comment section of some newspaper articles are not worth reading and may sometimes spoil the reading experience. https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	I think that the idea of users submitting personal data before making a comment can have positive and negative effects - positive in the sense that the user may think twice before posting hate speech and that they can be tracked down and educated; negative in the sense that the user could be on a website that wants to use user's personal data for the wrong reasons. I am still of the view that comments with hate speech need to be filtered out because each individual needs to be responsible in their speech.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	Just allow people to report bad comments and when it gets to a certain number it should delete the message and send an automatic email to the person who wrote it with a warning.

I agree with FransescoT online forums can be a wonderful community but hate speech with faceless people can ruin it. If you want to comment there should be some accountability.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	yes! This is exactly what i said	read though the comments and only put on the comments with the less hate speech on
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	I agree with this position since when providing personal data people would be less incentivized to starting hate speach
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	Personally I think it would require a well developed algorithm moderated by a team that updates it regularly to make sure it flags the correct material and continually updates it's database of words, phrases and dogwhistles
__label__noRel	I don't think they do. From what I see some newspapers want to know exactly how people feel even if what is written causing a bit of chaos	i think one can filter the comment so that only the comment that show love are seen by people
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	The best solution would be one that elegantly ties the reduction of hate speech in the comment section with no detrimental effect to the publics freedom of speech. This could be done by setting guidelines for hate speech, and also ensuring that the public provides identifying information such as their email address and especially their phone number. Both can be tracked to the person. To take it even further would be to be able to collect data such as ip addresses( with the commenters permission of course) when the person sends their comment so as to be able hold them accountable for any hate speech they send in. This will prevent people from using such language and hoping to hide under anonymity.
__label__noRel	I agree	Well..hate speech is a problem then there is freedom of speech as well. There is a possibility a writer is giving valid points.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	the comment section should be set in a way that filters certain words that promote hate speech
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed.

__label__noRel	Media isn't about sparking debate it's about catching our attention, profiting off our attention and sharing their biased view with us. Some countries have tighter regulations for media than others as well, plus they write salacious headlines for sale knowing people won't always read the full text of the article. They cause the polarization in conversation.	It is true that it would be difficult to remove and control all of the comments however i think it would be a lot more damaging to remove the right to freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	A combination of a warning system, detailing what might be considered hate speech and a manual review if potential hate speech is detected as well as on manual reports (allowing brief descriptions for reasons for reporting) seems like a good way to go about it. People who have a history of posting more than one hate comment on the platform should be moderated each time before their comment gets publicised whether it's detected as hate speech by the algorithm or not. They would lose the privilege of being able to comment instantly without review.
__label__noRel	By eliminating the entire comment secion you would be getting rid of the freedom of readers comments	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	I don't believe removing the comment section will help remove hate speech, but having a system that can track the device and the people that use that device can go a long way in removing trolls from a community platform and prevent them from becoming repeat offenders.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	While censoring certain words in the context of a comment would help reduce hate speech, an issue that would need to be considered is the use of images used as hate speech. Some "memes" can contain hate speech to the AI may misinterpret this as a regular image while the image could be posted as hate speech. An example of this is when people on Reddit use images as "memes" containing racism and sometimes the bot does not flag it as racism. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Having read all of the previous discussion surrounding this debate, I still stand by my original opinion. Moderating comments by an official representative of the newspaper doesn't allow for free speech. We do however, need to eliminate hate speech. I think the best way to do this is to put this in the hands of the community and other readers.
__label__noRel	This solves one problem - no one can then be offended	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	Reduces hate speech	The most surprising position was to completely eliminate the comments section. various studies have been conducted in this regard and they all agree on one thing and that deleting comments is not a good idea and can damage the general perception of the outlet. https://mediaengagement.org/research/how-the-public-views-deletion-of-offensive-comments/
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Hate speech must be banned totally from the online publications.
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	There needs to be rules and regulations stating the type of comments that can be made about other people. There should also be verification of a persons identity everytime they make a comment so that is visible who the statement was made by. Newspaper articles should constantly ready and delete hate speech comment.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	I don't think newspapers, who have already seen their takings plummet in recent years due to everything moving online, will want to pay to employ moderators for their articles. They would need to have a pretty high number of mods in order to keep up as each newspaper carries so many articles. This topic is a massive minefield and I don't think there is a simple solution to it.

__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__noRel	I agree	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I agree while hate speech can be and should be monitored and removed immediately in order to reduce trauma on affected group and not to embolden other bigots. Platforms should still allow users to express opinions contrary to the creators. Peer review of reporting works well in these instances when someone goes too far - but this is also abused by with review bombing	create a team of people that can look for and remove the hate speech and leave all other respectful arguments to make the comment section diverse.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	Again I think that removing comment sections entirely would overall be a negative thing. Yes, there are people who abuse the comments section and it they can use it to promote hate speech, but with the right tools this could be moderated. Removing comment sections entirely leaves us with a lack of space for healthy discussion and debate, new ideas and opportunities for learning

__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	The comments could be examined for offensive language.

Also I think if there were stricter punishments for hate speech the newspaper would make the person and newspaper think twice.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I disagree. I think other readers of hate speech could be influenced by it making the issue spread even further. You can share your opinions without using hate speech and with a balanced approach so it should be removed.	I think the best way to reduce hate speech in newspaper websites is to ensure that the site can detect words and phrases that can be considered hate speech, and block them from being posted on the comment section. Also, a moderator to approve each comment section before it becomes publicly accessible is a notion which can be adopted as well.

__label__noRel	I do agree that sometimes people can mistake different opinions as hate speech but I do think it is quite easy to understand that hate speech involves language that disrespect the person you are talking to	I think that readers who use hate speech should be reported and temporarily banned from the site, as I believe that we need comments section in online newspaper articles.

__label__noRel	Tasking whole units with not only moderation of hate speech but also tracking it and analysing it for trends is a huge additional workload for an already stretched sector.

Or better yet, have moderators in comments sections.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it.

__label__noRel	They can already do this, take a look at social media policy and they can, but choose not to in fear of going against freedome of speech.	Hate speech is a problem but we do need to have debate. We need to respect different views and allow people to voice their opinion where necessary to further a debate on a news topic.

__label__noRel	This article also discusses the use of moderators https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation	I think using a platform which blocks out certain words, kind of like a filter would help. So if someone made a post with a certain word in, that post would not be made public, instead the comment would be flagged and go to a admin, who can read the comment and then decide if the 'bot' which flagged it was correct or not, and then deciding if to allow the post to be made or not
__label__noRel	This would persuade people to think about the consequences of hate speech since they will have to take responsibility with people being able to identify them.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	Disagree! people should be abl eto express themselves in a respectful manner.	Nice. Your comment sums it up. Comments should be allowed to enable freedom of speech but vetted to prevent hate speeches that can invite violence amomgs the citizens
__label__noRel	could take a while	By flagging certain vocabulary which relates to hate speech and once this is flogged, the person commenting is blocked from posting their view. We would need to look at ways of getting around mispellings of the words though, as people could use this to get past the AI.
__label__noRel	we should be able to share love, this world needs that	I don't think algorithms are the answer. They need to be very, very sophisticated otherwise they require a human mediator.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	Instead of removing the comment section newspapers can try and look up new and different ways to facilitate their reader engagement.
__label__noRel	People will speak what is on their mind	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I agree with that. We shouldn't incentive hate speech.	Hate speech is an attack, a threat, or prehudice speech.
__label__noRel	Hoping that they may publish is wishful thinking as well unless they have a system for it.	I think everyone raised some good points already, but overall, it seems to be that some moderation is required no matter what, and that might be too costly for some smaller platforms to implement.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	I completely agree with this. This will make an open space for people to leave their comments but also make sure that everything is checked before its posted.	I think comments give the ability to the users to express their opinion on what is described in the articles and this is an important rule for democracy. Removing the ability to comment in my view is basically limiting free speech. I also believe that user do not need necessarily to be identifiable, being anonymous is fine as long as they respect others and their opinions.
__label__noRel	It is nice to think we could reduce hate speech.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	I disagree with this. I think taking away discussion completely also takes away healthy debate and positive conversation. There are ways to reduce hate comments, such as the ones outlined in this Forbes article: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnrampton/2015/04/09/10-tips-to-dealing-with-trolls/?sh=58ddf0f754f4.	I think it is important for people to be able to comment on newspapers websites, but I think there needs to be a way of moderating the comments section to prevent/remove hate speech.
__label__noRel	Reduces freedom of speech	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I believe that most people actually do realize the damage that hate speech can cause and are either deliberately using a platform to incite violence/harm/distress or just don't care as they dont see the people they are using hate speech against as being worth feeling for. There is enough research now to show the direct links between hate speech and hate crimes	Removing the comment section from online newspapers is not the answer. Allowing people to post their opinions is healthy and a normal part of human society- people will not always agree. However, in order to reduce hate speech, which can so often lead to crime, it could be done so that there are monitors (either human or computer) who check comments before they are posted to ensure they are not hate speech.
__label__noRel	Agreed	not all stories need people to add their opinions sothat should ease the pressure on moderators
__label__noRel	Perfect	Before an opinion is published it must be moderated and if it contains hate speech then the writer will not be able to post it.
__label__noRel	there is no guarantee that other platforms will not also have hate speech, if anything they might even encourage it more as they may attract a particular group of people who are interested in spreading hate speech	Despite my defence of human moderators, it seems they too are flawed -- check out this article https://www.technologynetworks.com/informatics/news/ai-trusted-as-much-as-humans-to-flag-hate-speech-365777 -- human moderators are not only prone to bias but also impractical. With the huge wealth of content posted every second online, it is unrealistic to expect humans to be able to view, criticise, and moderate every single comment.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	I think it's a bit of a lost cause. People will put hate speech in. The only way to stop it, I think is to not allow comments to be made. Technically, that's what happens with print versions of newspapers. We just read the article. Anyone who wants to express an opinion can write a letter to the editor. (Who would screen out hate stuff!). But, we live in an online world. So people expect to be able to have their say. And people probably wouldn't subscribe if they can't interact on an online service. Anyway, I do think people having verified accounts might help. Need to stop the "anonymous" profiles - the coward's castle types.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	exclude certain words from being posted
__label__noRel	Everyone has a right to say but it should be put across correctly	I believe the following article could provide more information on hate speech, not only in the context of this discussion but as a whole and what can be done to combat it. https://www.stompoutbullying.org/blog/hate-speech
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	I'm of the supporting view that the use of AI to filter out Hate speech could prove to be very useful
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	I agree and I think because there are so many people with so many different opinions, it should be censored before it is either posted or passed through the section.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	I think all the hate speech my be removed before it is published on public
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	Having read all of the previous discussion surrounding this debate, I still stand by my original opinion. Moderating comments by an official representative of the newspaper doesn't allow for free speech. We do however, need to eliminate hate speech. I think the best way to do this is to put this in the hands of the community and other readers.
__label__noRel	Who and what would be classed as a less strict criteria?	using key words and having moderators might help
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	I think that definition of hatespeech needs to be laid out clearly as I think different people have different ideas on what constitutes hatespeech - perhaps if there was a kind of premediation that informs the user that what they are engaging in qualifies as hatespeech it may make them more likely to reconsider their messages introducing a form of self moderation as well as external moderation
__label__noRel	I agree	Completely doing away with the comment section would not be beneficial to the readers experience as reading other peoples thoughts is what sets online media apart from offline media. It plays a role in keeping the discussion going. It would be smart to rather monitor comments to ensure hate speech or utterances of a vile nature are greatly reduced through the use of some sort of algorithm that picks up on problematic words and deletes comments or it being done manually by people who will moderate the comment section.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	Develop a software that will not allow posting of any hate speech
__label__noRel	I think using AI would not prove to be very effective. If this AI was to be self-supervised (without any moderators) I think it would quickly start flagging not-hateful comments as hate speech since it's very susceptible to user input - see what happened to Microsoft's Twitter bot Tay. After a couple of weeks, if I'm not mistaken, the AI started posting very hateful tweets about the holocaust and minorities.	I agree that discussions should be moderated. But what happens when the moderators themselves are biased?
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	This is exactly what should happen in all comments section! Only then people will learn to be respectful of others	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	AI could be used to flag hate speech, meaning comments that are hate speech can be flagged at the time. The tech needs more work though based on this article: https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/04/1025742/ai-hate-speech-moderation/
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	It is important that people are able to have a voice, especially as it can be a great tool in educating people, and giving people a variety of viewpoints that they wouldn't necessarily get to often hear. Sometimes we learn best by hearing and understanding the views of other people. We don't have to necessarily change our opinions, but it can help us become more aware of why or how people feel a certain way about things.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks.

__label__noRel	Recent congressional hearings have highlighted the chasm between Democrats and Republicans on the issue. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler convened a hearing in the aftermath of the New Zealand attack, saying the internet has aided white nationalism’s international proliferation. “The President’s rhetoric fans the flames with language that—whether intentional or not—may motivate and embolden white supremacist movements,” he said, a charge Republicans on the panel disputed. The Senate Judiciary Committee, led by Ted Cruz, held a nearly simultaneous hearing in which he alleged that major social media companies’ rules disproportionately censor conservative speech, threatening the platforms with federal regulation. Democrats on that panel said Republicans seek to weaken policies dealing with hate speech and disinformation that instead ought to be strengthened.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.

There can be interesting and thoughtful comments and we would miss from them. Newspapers websites should instead try to regulate the comment space by introducing a bot or hiring appropriate moderators or there should be some punishment to discourage the use of hate speech.

Despite our general right to freedom of speech, hate speech remains inextricably linked to hate crimes and intolerance.

__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it.

We all have freedom of speech but it is our responsibility to ensure that our speech does not cause harm on others. If people do not want to be responsible in their speech, then their speech should be reduced because things have consequences. So, the hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by removing comments with hate speech or having a software that can identify hate speech in a comment before it is posted.
__label__noRel	By total scrapping of the comment section, reporters might get away with misinforming the public therefore they need to be called out right on the spot but in a respectful manner.	Through active moderation.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry.

Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	In the book "Noise" it talks about taking the median for everyones view and making that the regulation. The conversation then becomes which views qualify as each end of this opinion spectrum? Surely not the hateful ones but a modicum of their views so they feel included instead of fuelling their distrust of systems not built for them.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	I think filtering hate speech comments can do that and allowing a better more positive and a welcome experience to all readers.
__label__noRel	I agree in principle to the idea of moderators, but in practice this can be a pretty blunt tool and quite labour intensive.	I think we could have a hold on comments until it is checked and fact checked by a panel of people! Not just one person making the decision. Also I think if there were stricter punishments for hate speech the newspaper would make the person and newspaper think twice.
__label__noRel	Great! I have a similar approach	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	I agree	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I agree that requiring ID, and utilising AI should greatly reduce hate speech	Take a few minutes to breathe, meditate, and physically calm your body down before you start typing your response.

__label__noRel	I agree that the hate speech perhaps should not be entirely removed. Sometimes a society has to confront its own ugliness/hatred head on, and removing it might do more harm than good (ie making commenters feel persecuted, perhaps making them even more hateful or violent). I also agree that still being able to access the newspaper might help change their minds.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed.

__label__noRel	I think they hold some responsibility. But perhaps not in the way this survey is trying to determine. A free flow of ideas is necessary, which includes difficult and often cantankerous and vigorous differing opinions. It should be the responsibility of said sites to allow those types of opinions, but deal with the trolls that free and open debate often attract.	My final argument is that it is possible to monitor and reduce hate speech on website comments by using both AI and human intelligence
__label__noRel	I agree	There should be a strict comment management system in place, someone has to supervise it and react (and possibly penalise) to users spreading hate speech. The comments should not be anonymous since people feel more inclined to be hostile when hiding under a pseudonym. Maybe asking to verify your identity before posting a comment would make people think more before spreading hate.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	by having a system or word check that will not allow users to use words that are considered as hate speech
__label__noRel	i agree, people who repeatadly post negative hateful comments need to have suspensions and bans	Reduce hate speech by screening out certain words. If a comment contains such words, it is deleted or hidden from public view
__label__noRel	Regulation of the comment section will definitely help reduce the hate speech	Removing the comment section will not be effective since there will not be any interactions between readers.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	Firstly, newspapers need to enact a proper system of moderation. Blocking all comments infringes on free speech and does not allow readers to provide a counterpoint to the position provided in the article.
__label__noRel	This may cost a company, but will also create jobs in our current stressful climate.	We can reduce hate speech by holding the owner of the platform accountable for hate speech being on their platform, this will force the platform owners to put strict systems in place to ensure this does not occur.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	Hate speech will always appear on open forums. The problem stems from how to stop this from happening.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	I am unsure if there is a way to reduce hate speech. One persons 'hate speech' is anothers 'freedom of speech'. As a supposedly democratic nation, we need to be able to permit people from all walks of lives and experiences to air their own personal views, whether these are educated views or not.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	We need to block the users that use hate speech and filter the comments that have any form of hate speech.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Having read through the opinions of others, my stance has not completely changed. It is important to censor comments, freedom of speech does not always equate to disrespecting the views and opinions of others. While I agree that comments should be censored, I do not agree that every comment should be removed. As mentioned before, a system can be implemented that removes comments with certain words, thus making the comment section a safe space for all who use it.
__label__noRel	True, creates a hurdle that some people don't wanna do	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.

__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	I believe if we can be on the same page and let the media tell the story the truth with out lashing out on it.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way.

__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	The best way to curb hate speech would be to have the comments section moderated for any forms of hate speech. In this manner people who have an opinion with substance can have a say in whatever article that was published.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	have word filters
__label__noRel	While this would eliminate all hate speech, newspapers would not implement it, as the interaction drives hits on their site, so the comments section is an essential part of spreading the news person to person	Comment sections need to be well-moderated, and if algoritmic or user comment flagging is used this needs to also be reviewed by a human moderator to ensure that there is no bias or bad faith reporting going on.
__label__noRel	Hate speech is a blurred line and comes in different forms based on factors such as geography.	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	I think that a comment section is necessary for engagement and exchange of ideas but having said that, there should be a code for AI embedded within that platform which will be able to detect hate speech or words classified as hate speech then the AI can delete them automatically. Also people can report the comment and the AI should delete the comment within minutes of it being reported.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	Yes there must be a a strong policy for reviewal before publishing.
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	freedom of speech is essential but hate speech is not. comments should be left on but perhaps there could be a programme which finds key words and eliminates the comment if it seems to be hateful
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	It's a balance. There should be the ability to pre- and post-moderate comments. Pre- using technology to recognise potentially offensive words as well as closer moderation of articles on potentially controversial topics. Post-moderation to allow readers to report offensive topics which will be hidden from view until moderated.
__label__noRel	agree, the news could start selling fake information if the comment section would be removed	In my opinion the comment section should not be removed. I personally get very annoyed if I watch or read something and want to express my opinion, then go down to the comment section to sadly find out the comments are turned off. This limits the freedom of speech and blocks the ability for the people to vent out somehow. I think this builds aggression and causes problems afterwards. The better thing to do is to limit bad speech, foul words and cursing but removing the comments completely is not a good idea.
__label__noRel	But on the other hand, peoples opinions matter, it allows us to learn from each other when it is truly done right	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	https://www.dw.com/en/turkey-introduces-jail-terms-for-disinformation/a-63435062 Here is an example of a news article, which highlights the potential dangers/misuse of personal datas provided to social media and news sites. Although this is not a UK based news item, it is an example of how information can be mis-used.	Agreeing with others here: a standard of moderation would have to be communicated to the user, with straightforward policies of flagging or reporting potentially hateful comments. A synthesis of live and algorithmic moderators might be best, as certain words can be auto-flagged for review, whereas other things might involve a more delicate touch.
__label__noRel	Allowing people to express their opinions ensures that there is free speech	ADD A HATE SPEECH DETECTOR
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	Free speech is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it is necessary for an effective democratic society and on the other hand, people tend to abuse the right. Newspapers and publishing companies are major symbols of free speech, however, and there will always be disadvantages to be endured, hate speech inclusive. The solution is not to disable comment spaces but to continually implore and push for cooperation amongst readers.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	Have human and AI to verify potential hateful speech. Given our current resources we should be able to allocate a human check given the rating of the flag by the AI
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	Moderating comments could be a viable solution. The use of AI could make it easier given that there could be thousands and thousands of comments, too much for human moderator/s to keep track of.
__label__noRel	Education only goes so far - some people will just ignore this policy. Perhaps just removing hate speech manually, or having a review process so only non-hate speech comments are published may be better.	Hate speech must be eliminated. The only way to do this thoroughly is with human moderation.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	I was completely taken aback by some strong stances to remove the comment space, and the belief in that because Newspapers should be one-sided providers. I would disagree because newspaper share societal information and society should be allowed to engage and be part of the conversation instead of just consuming whatever information is being released for consumption. It has been seen as a result of other newspaper websites removing the comment section that it reduces the trust of the reader because they are aware of the bias of the information they are consuming, and also it reduces the amount of time readers spend on these sites because there is no community engagements.

__label__noRel	great comment, thanks for adding verified sources which strengthens these ideas	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	Make readers agree to not sharing hate speech and let them know that if they do, they will be blocked from commenting.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	In an ideal world perhaps, but how would you recognise 'hate speech' and police this in practical terms without infringing civil liberties and free speech. AI offers one avenue, but many challenges remain and there are many risks with this approach: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0221152	The is no need to moderate comments they must be dished out raw as they are writen by the readers
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	But education and training and awareness are also needed, so people don't repeat what mistakes they have done in the past.
__label__noRel	I think also need to consider the peoples rights and ensure that they reduce the hate speech and increasingly integrate many forms of social media into their intimate, social and political lives, produce, are exposed to, and combat hate speech online.	Recent political positions in the UK have lead to more fighting for 'free speech' and saying that it is ok to be offended - this is shown in a police news release (https://www.college.police.uk/article/protecting-freedom-expression-updated-guidance). I would disagree - offending people is unacceptable.
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	In addition to reducing hate speech by site moderation community moderation could also take place having the ability to flag a post for the attention of moderators which violates terms of service.
__label__noRel	Manpower intensive	I think that the website should develop a hate speech filtering software, to remove all offensive words that might be of hate speech.
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	I think there must be a system that will detect hateful comments and block them.
__label__noRel	Having comments has shown that readers engage more in the argument https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/	Using moderators, educating users, calling out trolls and haters!
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Develop a software that will not allow posting of any hate speech
__label__noRel	bit over stated	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	The problem is can an algorithm actually make the full determination of what is hateful and not? It may have the same biases.	Make readers agree to not sharing hate speech and let them know that if they do, they will be blocked from commenting.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	comments should be moderated but we cannot remove all the negative and leave the positive comments. it would look like the newspaper is being biased
__label__noRel	I think using AI would not prove to be very effective. If this AI was to be self-supervised (without any moderators) I think it would quickly start flagging not-hateful comments as hate speech since it's very susceptible to user input - see what happened to Microsoft's Twitter bot Tay. After a couple of weeks, if I'm not mistaken, the AI started posting very hateful tweets about the holocaust and minorities.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	What about people who have a view that is considered unpopular or opposing? Say it's election time - what would happen if one team uses tech-warriors to delete pro- opposition comments just because they go against their agenda?	I agree with your ideas. I think it still gives people a voice but without going too far
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	have an admin or moderator remove inappropriate comments.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__noRel	There are ways to circumvent the autobanning of words.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button	report anyone as soon as it is seen so they can be dealt with and removed.

Thank you for this!, this is a great idea
__label__noRel	Being able to track down those who have posted hate speech would be useful in putting a stop to them and may discourage those who like to post things anonymously from posting in the first place	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I have to agree with DamianC above, I notice a lot of hate speech on twitter for example and I feel this would if anything create more problems as they would have zero control over the platform.	The way to fairly reduce hate speech is to use a mix of technology and human intervention to manage the potential volume of moderation required to provide a healthy environment for discussion. There are a number of tools available that allow for pre- and post-moderation to curb the worst excesses of user comments. This can be further enhanced by requiring readers to give a little more data about themselves to reduce the anonymity which provides a cloak for the potentially worst expressions of hatred.
__label__noRel	Having comments has shown that readers engage more in the argument https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	I agree that it all should be reviewed before it is published
__label__noRel	my thoughts exactly..Hate speech can also be helpful in improving the news papers.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	I don't think it's helpful to cancel the comment space completely, we should have the ability to post our thoughts.
__label__noRel	I agree that we have to be very careful around censorship. Shutting commentary down because it doesn't fit your agenda or internal narrative can be very dangerous as it is a tool used by dictators.	I think we firstly have to call out hate speech in order for people to learn that it is not okay and unacceptable. The reason being online 'haters' tend to abuse their right to free speech such that it infringes upon the next person because they have the comfort of knowing that nobody will find put who they really are and confront them. By calling out users on the newspaper website and responding to their comment as the moderator of the comments, and actually suspending their accounts because of it can go a long way.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	Filter comments or have a ban on words that come across as hateful.
__label__noRel	Negativity	Filter comments or have a ban on words that come across as hateful.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	i believe commenting should have it's policy, where users have to read the policy before commenting. So if a user uses language that promotes hate speech, the comment should be removed.
__label__noRel	hate speech affects people differently, it might not affect some but it differently hurt others	Some hate speech is actually illegal, so that should definitely be reported and removed. https://www.report-it.org.uk/reporting_internet_hate_crime
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	newspapers are unlikely to policy it as no publicity is bad publicity to them. the more engagements they get, the better.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	exclude certain words from being posted
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	It is easy to be hateful online when you are anonymous. Before being able to comment on newspaper websites, users should be required to sign up using traceable methods (eg. some form of identification). The comment section should regularly be monitored and any users who post hate speech should face serious consiquences
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is often used as a reason not to have readers comments. It seems that this is not a fair argument for eliminating readers comments because of the psychological phenomenon of "cognitive dissonance" - we automatically search for echo chambers in any context.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	I think that a comment section is necessary for engagement and exchange of ideas but having said that, there should be a code for AI embedded within that platform which will be able to detect hate speech or words classified as hate speech then the AI can delete them automatically. Also people can report the comment and the AI should delete the comment within minutes of it being reported.
__label__noRel	true	We can start by encouraging people to debate and say their opinions to incite meaningful and helpful conversations and comments instead of hate and other harmful communication types
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	This removes balanced media consumption (people will get even more stuck in echo chambers!) and the idea of free-press means that there should be freedom to cross-examine	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	yes, I agree, need moderators,	we need to stop coment section
__label__noRel	I think when there are professionals they can be balanced and have training alongside guidelines which can help guide what is and is not allowed	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	My concern is that comments could be flagged as inappropriate in bad faith e.g. to shut down the opinions of those people disagree with even if the comments are not inappropriate or hateful	1. Only allow verified accounts to post - these accounts should be easily traced back to individuals. 2. Moderate comments with both algorithms and human visibility. 3. Prosecute.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	I think we have to use some fact checking system that allows us to present thoughts and opinions, the system can block derogatory comments. This allows for a calm debate
__label__noRel	I would agree, but this article (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0163443712472089?casa_token=FJm_UB0wIqEAAAAA%3ALr9dI-lrHJemMa9XgBVkx8tCkSQUSUAg14owxExDkpThv0tpIu6LJySR_p7EJ_lPqQbiATTxEfULs7k) states that filtering racism doesn't really stop racism, it just encourages it to go elsewhere. Maybe it will protect sites that use it, but otherwise, people will still find racism online. And maybe that's not the responsibility of the news site, but I find it disheartening still.	This is something that I think is impossible to do. One can never ever be sure of people s intensions. I don't believe newspaper websites should even have space for readers comments , there are other platforms where readers can express themselves
__label__noRel	People are entitled to freedom of speech and shouldn't have their views taken away from them	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	I agree. Just moderate the comment sections a bit more.	The comments could be examined for offensive language. For instance, there might be a robot that scans comments for offensive language and deletes them.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	comment sections should not be removed as that will prevent those with positive comments form sharing their thoughts, they should instead be reviewed regulary so that hate speech is flagged and removed another solution is for comments to be approved by moderators before they go public

Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	create a team of people that can look for and remove the hate speech and leave all other respectful arguments to make the comment section diverse.
__label__noRel	I do agree with you, but I think the people also should have a way of reporting comments.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	takes away the ability for people to express their hate	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__noRel	I agree, reported and removed. The person should also be given a statement reasoning as to why they were removed and reported. They could also be given warnings for this.	Younger people are susceptible to propaganda by the establishment "elites", they will be easy targets of manipulation by saying that ALL opposing views are "hate speech".
__label__noRel	It's a good idea, but too many get giddy at trying to break rules and in doing so, ruin things.	due to the changing world and the improvement of technology,the internet is like a black canvas and anyone can put anything they want on it,but even though technology is improving most websites dont use basic protection,they could do things like add comment filters,then this ensures that hateful words or phrases cannot be used but positive and informative words and statements can be
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	I think we could have a hold on comments until it is checked and fact checked by a panel of people! Not just one person making the decision. Also I think if there were stricter punishments for hate speech the newspaper would make the person and newspaper think twice.
__label__noRel	Deplatforming and deleting contentis effective when it comes to content moderation. https://www.greens-efa.eu/files/assets/docs/alternative_content_web.pdf	It's a balance. There should be the ability to pre- and post-moderate comments. Pre- using technology to recognise potentially offensive words as well as closer moderation of articles on potentially controversial topics. Post-moderation to allow readers to report offensive topics which will be hidden from view until moderated.
__label__noRel	Why couldn't you directly comment on the newspaper? How is a different platform going to really help?	readers comments be moderated and anything that is harmful, hateful or hurtful should be removed. this allows people to exercise their right of freedom of speech but limiting the harm that someones opinion may have
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	I would not eliminate the hate speech right away but rather alarm the user and ask them to refrain from that kind of speech or ask them to elaborate or explain the reasons for the anger. Maybe as a moderator I would try to understand their viewpoint because by removing the speech there will be just more anger and hatred.
__label__noRel	An easy and inexpensive way to stop hateful comments	you cannot eliminate it. dont try. freedom of speech is importante and we must appreciae others have different view
__label__noRel	Allowing people to express their opinions ensures that there is free speech	Personally I think it would require a well developed algorithm moderated by a team that updates it regularly to make sure it flags the correct material and continually updates it's database of words, phrases and dogwhistles
__label__noRel	Yep, this is the way.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	I agree it would be a good solution better than moderators because moderators are humans and they can make mistakes.	we could use bots the get triggered when certain words are used. The bot will therefore remove the comment andhold it until it has mannually reviewed by a human. Another option can be to allow the users to report comments from other users and if the reports reach a certain threshold then hold that comment for review.
__label__noRel	This would be a good idea in theory, but there is not enough man-power to do this. Who would fund these moderators?	Focus on neural subjects, but in reality hate speech is just a part of life
__label__noRel	It would certainly be effective as there's a team solely focused on that.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	most people dont bother to read more, they just look at the quick soundbites without thinking if they are fake or not	I don't think removing the comment section reduces hate speech per se, it just pushes it elsewhere. I can't help feeling this sort of censorship is an infringement on free speech.
__label__noRel	Newspapers are a valid and beneficial space for comments	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	People who take part in hate speech should be dealt with lawfully so as its a form of cyber-bullying, that way less people will resort to hate speech
__label__noRel	This article also discusses the use of moderators https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	It is important for people to voice their opions so I do not thik this discussion is fair, however I do agree that comments should be moderated. The readers should also be made aware of the rules that apply to commenting with regards to hateful speech.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	I think that moderation is the most effective way of preventing hate speech. Filtering comments would not work as it is difficult to find a algorithm for the context of a comment. Free speech is so important it should not be removed.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	Newspaper websites should implement ways such as word filters, moderators and more strict rules and regulations to prevent post that include hate speech to be minimised. They can also educate people about the dangers of hate speech. "Fight back against harmful messages in public places by publicly standing with victims in solidarity" https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/combat-onlin-hate-speech/
__label__noRel	Discussion will always happen. This would encourage discussion to happen elsewhere in forums without direct reference to the news article or without any moderation. It also pushes discussion into social media platforms where discussion tends to be more polarised and less productive.	A system should be developed to detect certain words that are considered as hate speech. This will help prevent or eliminate hate speech comments
__label__noRel	I overall agree. But, newspaper comment sections are very public and mainstream. Allowing hate speech on such places makes it seem less taboo, and more allowed. These aren't the kinds of ideas we want people to think are 'ok'.	It hink a moderation is required for hate speech. Removing the entire comment section is not an ideal option. However, hate speech is alsoa crime. It is clear that there should be some monitoring in social media in terms of tracking down the user when necessary so similar terms with the real world would be valid. If you make a crime in real word you get you will stand trial so similar option should be valid for social media.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	This project takes the approach of counterspeech, whereby hateful comments are not removed, but instead responded to with alternative, police and non-aggressive comments. https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/counterspeech-better-way-tackling-online-hate
__label__noRel	Having an open platform allows racists to have a forum to vent	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	I support the filtering of comments instead of removing the comment section. A filtering systems should be put in place	Moderating is good and maybe informing the person why their message was moderated so that they know and do better next time
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	I kind of agree, but I think that organisations have a responsibility to put something in place to monitor their comment sections. Even if it's not an algorithm and it's an actual person instead! Although your link shows how difficult this would be for a huge organisation like FB.
__label__noRel	agree, the comment section is an important tool to exchange your opinion with others	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	The comment section should be a safe where everyone is free to place their opinion and ask question without someone making them feel somehow about themselves.	exclude certain words from being posted
__label__noRel	comments on every platform can become a breeding ground for hate. It becomes a place for people to vent and voice their hateful comments, it can also lead to bullying and other negative aspects of online life. Comments should be banned unless heavily moderated.	the comment section should not be disabled as is it there for the readers to engage with the content uploaded so it makes no sense to close it, however there should be restrictions.
__label__noRel	can be subjective what someone views as hate speech someone else might not agree	Maybe the only solution is to remove the space for comments? We see the same issues on other platforms that allow comments!
__label__noRel	Making people pay would make you think before signing up to add comments.	I think rather than removing the option to comment/debate below an article, there could be moderators and hate speech buttons and bots to keep hate speech at bay.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	People should be members with addresses checked
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	I think hate speech is always going to be a problem unfortunately, and although websites can monitor comments and remove any hate speech what ultimately is needed is teaching people there are better ways to get their opinions across and better use of freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	There is always going to be fake news, thats what sells. Hate speech is not the same as voicing an opinion.	To ensure freedom of speech is still maintained, moderation needs to be carried out fairly. To achieve this, we need to understand what is hate speech and what are the lines that seperate that with constructive criticism.

__label__noRel	The issue at hand is not the total elimination of hate speech, but whether it can be reduced on newspaper websites. A newspaper must responsibly manage its public platform, and giving platform to hate speech is a problem it can manage. A newspaper is, by definition, not a forum.	Moderation of both users and comments isn't difficult to implement and will weed out the idiots that want to ruin it.
__label__noRel	I agree, this kind of moderation would be helpful	Hate speech should not be allowed to dominate the narrative as it defeats the process and hinders effective communication. As a result, flagging and blocking of problematic accounts can prove to be effective in combating the spread of hate speech.
__label__noRel	freedom of speech and opinion to the articles the news we read.	Ideally comment section should not be available on newspaper to reduce hate speech
__label__noRel	agree	Censoring speech prevents progress as a soceity. (https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2016/04/free-speech-important/)
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	people should have values and respect for others.Just like facebook written words are monitored and people already know these rules.A set of rules should be set
__label__noRel	Agree, moderation is the way to go, as hate speech should not be part of any media forums.	block swearing, abusive, discrimatory words- freedom of speech without rasicism, name calling etc
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	Hate speech must be banned totally from the online publications.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Comment space encourages discussion of important topics and allows free exchange of information and so should not be eliminated. Independent moderators should be used in order to ensure that hate speech is quickly deleted and encourage users to express their ideas without using inappropriate or aggressive language.
__label__noRel	I agree, we cannot compromise free speech, we need to find a way to allow free speech whilst targeting the removal of hate speech	All the posts should be checked before being posted and verified by some sort of AI. Hate speech could affect a person's livelihood and mental state
__label__noRel	I agree, reported and removed. The person should also be given a statement reasoning as to why they were removed and reported. They could also be given warnings for this.	Hire moderators and similar positions, and also having filtering systems
__label__noRel	As much people have freedom of speech we are also obliged to respect other people whilst doing so.	Blocking words does not stop hate, what we need to do is have a filter that alerts a human so that a post. Posts/users should be identifiable to the platform they post on (not identifiable to the post but to the platform should any hate crime be identified)
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	There needs to be a level of moderation before comments are posted. Comments that are harmful, false or misleading shouldn't be allowed to be put up, but there should still be room for healthy debate.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	I think people should be able to express their feelings, but there should be a way to block hate speech
__label__noRel	True. At the end of the day, the publisher controls what is published	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	But software is not near good enough to accurately identify hate speech all the time. Language is complex and you can't pin HS through banning or flagging certain terms and phrases only.	Comments should be regulated, but comment space should not be removed.
__label__noRel	I definitely agree	More Admin and block buttons
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Hate speech is something people intentionally and so if people continue to participate in it, they should be punished.
__label__noRel	This will improve the language but not the other content	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	Comments could be checked for hate speech before going live.
__label__noRel	Hate speech is already defined in law in many countries. As its already a criminal offence , the existing legislation provides the definition of hate speech, and blueprint to follow.	We need to block the users that use hate speech and filter the comments that have any form of hate speech.
__label__noRel	The problem with allowing commentary to flourish without restrictions is that it can undermine the credibility of legitimate news sources. Frank Waddell, associate journalism professor at the University of Florida, noted that “If you see a bunch of individuals online who are leaving negative comments on a news article, you might think most people are evaluating this news as low quality,” Waddell said. “When asked to evaluate the news yourself, you might also think the news is more negative relative to someone who reads that same article without comments.” https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/	I would disagree richard, newspapers can often fuel hate speech through their phrasing and the way they choose to title their articles therefore it is down to them to avoid hate speech spreading on their websites.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	Algorithms also have issues and can be inherently racist: https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/18/21121286/algorithms-bias-discrimination-facial-recognition-transparency	Hate speech blocking should not be implemented, people must learn to take some criticism in a positive way, it can be helpful.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	By monitoring individual responses and removing those not deemed suitable for publication
__label__noRel	it is censorship	It seems like many users think that having your personally details posted along with your comment would be a deterrent for people to comment hate speech
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	This definitely needs human input, it's too sensitive a matter for machines!	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	i think these ideas would be the way forward and i agree	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__noRel	This is more than just censoring	With rights comes responsibility. We all have freedom of speech but it is our responsibility to ensure that our speech does not cause harm on others. If people do not want to be responsible in their speech, then their speech should be reduced because things have consequences. So, the hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by removing comments with hate speech or having a software that can identify hate speech in a comment before it is posted.
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	I think there should be moderators on articles that make the comments. less visible so offensive comments can have a warning before viewing
__label__noRel	It can be difficult to monitor everything all the time, but I think if something is reported and not deleted then fair enough.	There are other ways to reduce or block hateful comments without having to eliminate comment section.
__label__noRel	That's not true, there are millions of platforms to hold conversation about news articles without talking directly under them. Everything they right is open to public scrutiny.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	some mistook freedom of speech for spreading the hate speech. Some root causes of hate speech originate from child hood traumas and are deep, i do not think that we may be able to tackle those just for the comment section hate speech.	We do have to allow people to express their opinions - we can't pretend opinions don't exist. Having them out in the open lets us know what we're dealing with. But at the same time hate speech can't be allowed to flourish and absolutely needs to be challenged. There is a role for AI (which I have said before I know) to try and weed out and remove anything that is just pure hate and not any sort of coherent argument or opinion.
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	every comment submitted by readers must be checked internally for hate speech
__label__noRel	I agree with Ian. It has real life consequences. It is important that moderators can identify hate speech, that is not free speech.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-and-real-harm
__label__noRel	people should be heard	flag all the comments that contain vulgar words and warn the sender. the comment must be rephrased, failure to do so must result in the suspension of the sender from commenting
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	I agree	Free speech is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it is necessary for an effective democratic society and on the other hand, people tend to abuse the right. Newspapers and publishing companies are major symbols of free speech, however, and there will always be disadvantages to be endured, hate speech inclusive. The solution is not to disable comment spaces but to continually implore and push for cooperation amongst readers.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	There could be a segment in the website that gives informed context to a subject to prevent uninformed comments and furthermore the newspaper should monitor the comments and censor any hate speech comments.
__label__noRel	i do get your point, some hate speech does get severe, which is what should be removed, i think some should be removed from root, and yes some topics need you to talk about them	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	I think this is a great idea and would certainly help the situation if sone correctly.	Agreed

__label__noRel	I agree,that way people aren't bullied online.	The best way to reduce hate speech would be to make sure that moderators are present to check on comments, it would not be advisable to cancel comments completely due the feedback it gives and people will always have their opinions and sometimes they will involve hate speech, which is unavoidable...
__label__noRel	https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea that is a very good read to where to start finding point	educate young people on online politeness for want of a better word word have meaning and consequences in the real world and individuals have to take responsibility and not hide behind keyboards
__label__noRel	Completely agree - there's a lot of evidence out there to support this https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	Th Un have argued that we need to address hate crime https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech	I would disagree richard, newspapers can often fuel hate speech through their phrasing and the way they choose to title their articles therefore it is down to them to avoid hate speech spreading on their websites.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	I don't think it's helpful to cancel the comment space completely, we should have the ability to post our thoughts.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	I think that moderation is the most effective way of preventing hate speech. Filtering comments would not work as it is difficult to find a algorithm for the context of a comment. Free speech is so important it should not be removed.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	Some would argue it removes their right of freedom of speech. Despite whether it is of hateful intent or not.	Large companies need to invest more money in having paiI td moderators to monitor hate speech on their articles. I think all speech excpet for speech inciting people to commit violence or murder should be allowed even if i so not agree with it. I think that to prevent hate sppech it will start with educating young people
__label__noRel	I feel newspapers don't work well and an interactive medium anyway. "letters to the editor" might be an avenue	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	more online platform needs a moderator role, too often you see posts on social media that have rampant hate speech going unfiltered and the commenter going unpunished	Some of the comment section of some newspaper articles are not worth reading and may sometimes spoil the reading experience. https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	In my opinion the comment section should not be removed. I personally get very annoyed if I watch or read something and want to express my opinion, then go down to the comment section to sadly find out the comments are turned off. This limits the freedom of speech and blocks the ability for the people to vent out somehow. I think this builds aggression and causes problems afterwards. The better thing to do is to limit bad speech, foul words and cursing but removing the comments completely is not a good idea.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.

__label__noRel	this is good idea but some words can have more than one meaning and be used it variety of different sentences. so maybe muting words that could be discrimatory could have its limitations. i.e if you mut the word gay ( this word then count be used it postive topics about gay rights marriages etc .	Use a BOT to regulate hateful comments
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	Maybe filter through comments

__label__noRel	True and in my opinion the right to freedom of speech should trump any counter argument.	Free speech is a double-edged sword.

Newspapers and publishing companies are major symbols of free speech, however, and there will always be disadvantages to be endured, hate speech inclusive.

__label__noRel	Removing the option for opinion wouldn't stop the hate speech - this will just be featured somewhere else but being able to mark items as unkind would help identify things that may upset some people.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	I think having the viewer agree to use respectful language before they are taken to the comment section could have some minor benefits.	I have already said that people who have already displayed hate speech on a website should be banned from giving their opinion.
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	I feel that all users should provide true identification that can be used if they use hate speech to find them/report them.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.

__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	This article suggests that more hateful comments are posted when the article/content is about real world divisive events	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	I was completely taken aback by some strong stances to remove the comment space, and the belief in that because Newspapers should be one-sided providers. I would disagree because newspaper share societal information and society should be allowed to engage and be part of the conversation instead of just consuming whatever information is being released for consumption. It has been seen as a result of other newspaper websites removing the comment section that it reduces the trust of the reader because they are aware of the bias of the information they are consuming, and also it reduces the amount of time readers spend on these sites because there is no community engagements.

__label__noRel	I agree, feelings should be left out when giving your views.	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions

__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is often used as a reason not to have readers comments. It seems that this is not a fair argument for eliminating readers comments because of the psychological phenomenon of "cognitive dissonance" - we automatically search for echo chambers in any context.

There is no cure for hate speech, but there is a way to stand up against it. Speak out against hate speech - fight racism and bigotry with love, empathy, compassion, and strength. We may not be able to eliminate hatred entirely, but the more steps we can take to educate and support human beings, and speak out against injustice, the better this world will become. Resources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech
__label__noRel	I think it is part of the responsibility of having a website. If the newspaper is not listed as a +18 platform for using insults or hate speech, then young people would be affected.	I agree with the notion that being able to share our thoughts and feelings is a right and having people share their views can help people to question their own thoughts. The inclusion of moderators to prevent people from posting discriminatory or harmful comments would be good, but difficult to ensure these moderators aren't biased towards one argument
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	to make everyone fairly represented to make sure	I agree that free speech should be honoured and upheld. That being said, newspapers are their own entities that should have autonomy over their interactions and comments from readers. Therefore, I think the use of moderators, filtering out certain offensive language, and strict and visible posting guidelines are good ways to reduce hate speech on these websites.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	This is right.

__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	I totally agree that hate speech should be limited as some readers do not take it lightly and may harm themselves after reading. I have heard stories about people ending their lives after their stories which often are embarassing are published, and the situation made worse by the comment section.
__label__noRel	not fair on those who don't mean hate	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	while you cant express yourself on that post doesnt mean you cant be open in other places where may be more appropriated	Totally agree . Users all human beings after all
__label__noRel	I agree but what is to be done about those who use hate speech? Do we just let them be? And what about the newspaper's reputation? Should they be known as a newspaper that allows people to comment on whatever they like with no repercussions?	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	not everyone has the same education or principles	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	Agreed. No allowing the public to share their views only allows the publication to share information without being challenged and I don't think that's fair. There should at least be room for engagement and debate by the public.	Agreed
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	It is true that it would be difficult to remove and control all of the comments however i think it would be a lot more damaging to remove the right to freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	Hate speech is everywhere, not just in the newspaper
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	we can do that by having strict rules on language and hate speech where one can be blocked from commenting or their comments gets removed if there is any negativity
__label__noRel	This would allow comment sections to remain open while reducing hate speech.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	I agree	Having a screaning for all comments before they go up on the platform to make sure that they are not posted on the site.
__label__noRel	I believe those algorithms are not programmed to dealing with hate speech. Otherwise, social media would not be as toxic and emotionally as it is	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	True and in my opinion the right to freedom of speech should trump any counter argument.	Block known accounts with a history of hate speech
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	Perhaps if there was some form of verification to reduce the hate speeches rather than eliminate free speech completely	Hate speech is something people intentionally and so if people continue to participate in it, they should be punished.
__label__noRel	In principle a great idea, in practice this requires more money be spent on moderators and system updates	Hate speech is not a criticsm and should be avoided
__label__noRel	I disagree. Would you like to read a newspaper filled with hate speech just because they are not in charge of identifying what is hate speech or not?	report comment buttons could be useful but there should be monitors that check comments before they are allowed to be posted
__label__noRel	comments on every platform can become a breeding ground for hate. It becomes a place for people to vent and voice their hateful comments, it can also lead to bullying and other negative aspects of online life. Comments should be banned unless heavily moderated.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	I would agree, but this article (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0163443712472089?casa_token=FJm_UB0wIqEAAAAA%3ALr9dI-lrHJemMa9XgBVkx8tCkSQUSUAg14owxExDkpThv0tpIu6LJySR_p7EJ_lPqQbiATTxEfULs7k) states that filtering racism doesn't really stop racism, it just encourages it to go elsewhere. Maybe it will protect sites that use it, but otherwise, people will still find racism online. And maybe that's not the responsibility of the news site, but I find it disheartening still.	I think it'll be hard to do so, because everyone has the right to freedom of speech, but unless the comments brings acts of violence on people then it must be deleted
__label__noRel	Newspapers often weave opinion in to their presentation of the news, they don't always report just in a purely factual manner. No comment sections at all would stifle discussion.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	An article proving AI can be helpful, but can struggle to interpret or detect certain things, suggesting manual reviewing is still very important. https://www.latrobe.edu.au/nest/can-combat-rise-online-hate-speech/ On another note, I also think anonymity plays a huge role in what people allow themselves to post online and think that certain platforms should consider only allowing people to comment under their own identity rather than online handles and such.
__label__noRel	I absolutely agree, everyone should be able to express how they feel however shouldn't do so at the expense of others.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	Take a few minutes to breathe, meditate, and physically calm your body down before you start typing your response.
__label__noRel	I believe it is fair for hate speech comments to be censored, because it could lead to violent public behavior. (read this: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech)	They could force users to login and even if they chose to post annonymously, it can be flagged for hate speech and they can be banned from using the platform again.
__label__noRel	monitored comment section	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	modrate what can be posted before it allowed to be published finally
__label__noRel	would move the issue somewhere else	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	thats the bad outake as they will sell the information they want without any way for it to be debated	I think the comments should be monitored to avoid hate speech
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	A system should be developed to detect certain words that are considered as hate speech. This will help prevent or eliminate hate speech comments
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should be responsible, if they do not control the atmosphere of their commentary they will be believed to agree to any negative comments made.	I definitely think newspapers should remove the comment space because it encourages trolls and hate speech
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	i think one can filter the comment so that only the comment that show love are seen by people
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	Hate speech is something people intentionally and so if people continue to participate in it, they should be punished.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	The best thing would be to have some sort of app that monitors and regulate the language used. in a case where hate speech is found in a comment, the sentence should be blurred out.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	In a survey of news sites it was found that on average 11% of comments are removed...some of these are because they are spam and some because they are offensive. I think that the fact that it's more than one in two really shows how necessary moderation is, these issues are so common. Source: https://netino.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/WAN-IFRA_Online_Commenting.pdf (pg 7)
__label__noRel	Removing the comment section will not solve the problem but cause further frustration. It also takes away the opportunity for people to engage about issues and share ideas.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	To understand how this can be managed in order that peoples opinionsare taken into account and not dismissed.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	I agree with this and also think it is going to be a difficult one to get right for newspapers.	No-one should have to spend their time filtering out the disgusting things human beings are capable of saying about each other. Nobody has a right to comment on anything.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	Hate speech is an attack, a threat, or prehudice speech.
__label__noRel	I disagree. Removing the comments section is limiting access to echo chambers, quite literally.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I believe there are no pros to allowing hate speech	the comment section should not be disabled as is it there for the readers to engage with the content uploaded so it makes no sense to close it, however there should be restrictions.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	On the other hand if platforms are held accountable, they may prefer to remove all comments sections, so as not to be punished themselves.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Hate speech is a platform that can violate another person in any way, all the comments should be screened in order to avoid such happening in our society	There is no need to reduce hate speech, we just need to accept it. Banning or reducing hate speech is just censorship which is not acceptable.
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	Addressing hate speech should not mean prohibiting freedom of speech which is what you will be doing if the comments' section is removed. Instead a way to reduce the hate speech from escalating into something dangerous must be sourced and implemented. https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/UN%20Strategy%20and%20Plan%20of%20Action%20on%20Hate%20Speech%2018%20June%20SYNOPSIS.pdf
__label__noRel	Racists can no longer hide behind anonymity.	I am reminded while discussing this of the way Daily Mail in UK handles the comments section. It just mentions on top of the comments page that theses comments are not moderated.So it allows everybody to express their opionion. This is how it should be done in my opinion
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	we could use bots the get triggered when certain words are used. The bot will therefore remove the comment andhold it until it has mannually reviewed by a human. Another option can be to allow the users to report comments from other users and if the reports reach a certain threshold then hold that comment for review.
__label__noRel	I totally agree with this statement.	There should be some filters to remove bad comments
__label__noRel	I actually agree that eliminating the space for conversation on polarizing topics can reduce extremist echo chambers sometimes. Though they often move to other platforms that have zero regulations to hold that conversation when they can't have it where they saw something. Which increases the odds of being stuck in a hateful echo chamber.	It is important to allow people to express their view to abide with freedom of speech. However, having the option to view these comment with a warning would allow people to ignore potential hate speech comments but still lets them read it if they want to.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	Moderation is necessary. Closing comments is not the answer, as communication can help people to understand each other's viewpoints. If you take comments away because you're afraid of hate speech, you're going to be creating a barrier between you and your audience.
__label__noRel	Freedom of speech is important but it's important we use it in the correct way. If what we are saying results in bullying then that should be shutdown.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	By making rules it means they might lose a some of their viewers because most people are disrespectful and hate discipline	I think certain people should be not allowed to share their opinions publicly because their only intention is to create hate and to upset people. Separately, society need to be educated on how to communicate via Social Media.
__label__noRel	people have freedom of speech. which they can reflect upon their actions	I think you can put a price to the website- a subscription to readers.
__label__noRel	I totally agree we have freedom of expression	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	have an admin or moderator remove inappropriate comments.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	Stop calling it hate speech maybe it is just another opinion
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	Many people are against the reducing of hate speech from newspaper article, and I am with them on this. The main reason for putting comment section on newspaper websites was for readers to leave a comment, people will always have something to say whether it is good or bad. But AI can still be used to remove comments that can be severely harmful.
__label__noRel	Discussions helps to deepen learning, to remove it completely would hinder what you could know but they need to be monitored for sure. Hate speech is not okay.	Newspapers should be a pleasure to read and not make you angry after reading comments not having comments will make them more pleasurable to read again.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	Correct	Freedom of speech can be used as catch-all term to justify the use and propagation of bigoted and hateful language. If we accept that some language is not acceptable due to it's clearly hateful nature then we have to acknowledge that some form of censorship of those particular instances has to occur. I would suggest that eliminating all such spaces from newspaper websites would have a massive detrimental effect on valid, non-bigoted, freedom of speech a cornerstone of western life. We don't ban all cars because some people speed dangerously, we monitor the roads and ban the bad drivers. I suggest that as long as readers comments are monitored continually they should remain.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	According to newsy.com, between January and March 2022, Meta took action on more than 15 million pieces of hate speech content on Facebook. Roughly 95% of that was detected proactively by Facebook with the help of AI - https://www.newsy.com/stories/artificial-intelligence-is-used-to-track-down-hate-speech/#:~:text=Between%20January%20and%20March%202022,themes%20fall%20through%20the%20cracks.

__label__noRel	But that is not the question.	This is something that I think is impossible to do. One can never ever be sure of people s intensions. I don't believe newspaper websites should even have space for readers comments , there are other platforms where readers can express themselves
__label__noRel	I agree, this has been seen on platforms in the past. This article about an online horse game shows an example of a moderation team going a little 'mad with power', being more harsh when dealing with mentions of politics they personally disagree with (banning people who mention being LGBT but not banning those saying similar things which imply them to be straight) https://www.themanequest.com/blog/2020/3/21/horse-isle-3-war-crimes-and-lgbtq-visibility-a-case-study-in-how-not-to-approach-community-management	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__noRel	Hate speech should still not be given a platform	i do not agree with the method of doxxing people. hate speech has always existed, it is now on a more global scale because the world is more centralised as a result of social media. i believe the solution is censorship and moderation which sites like reddit and youtube already preactise.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Having a comments section can be ideal to engage in a healthy debate but will need to monitored very strictly to ensure there is no bullying or one sided views be taken against any individuals
__label__noRel	Cannot guarantee 100% data protection.	Newspapers and free speech functioned well for a couple of hundred years without instant comments. People used to write letters to the newspaper, including their name. The newspaper would then publish some letters anonymously. This meant that people were protected but offered well considered opinions, rather than abusive or nasty comments. Perhaps a slower postal system encourages better behaviour rather than an amplified Twitter-esque school-yard of bullying and abuse.
__label__noRel	i think more moderators are needed for this - and i don't think it means we live in a nanny state as i'm sure others will say.	by not allowing certain words to be used in the comments space
__label__noRel	I do not believe that the people writing hate comments on newspaper posts would spend time doing this, therefore, i feel like it would be a bad approach	The only way to combat hate speech is through open debate. Restricting any form of speech (even hate speech) could lead to hateful views becoming unchallenged and potentially result in violence. There is also the issue that newspapers could define hate speech as certain comments they don't like destroying any potential for open debate. By maintaining open debate hate speech can be called out and as a result, become less frequent.
__label__noRel	I completely agree, the internet already needed policies to stop hate speech or insults.	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	Moderating is good and maybe informing the person why their message was moderated so that they know and do better next time
__label__noRel	I agree. People should not stay silent through fear of someone taking offence at what they say. How can people figure out what their viewpoints are on things if they aren't allowed to ask questions are think aloud?	Hate speech is something people intentionally and so if people continue to participate in it, they should be punished.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	Websites need to be held accounbtable for hate speech
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I absolutely agree with this. As we've seen recently (https://medium.com/dfrlab/alt-right-and-alt-social-media-4fa23eb2fbd1) cracking down on the more ofensive comments on one website can lead to groups of people finding a more lenient place and bunching up there, creating a vicious cycle where they push each other to be more and more extreme. It's true that we should monitor the comment section, but overdoing it could lead to worse results somewhere else.	Nice. Your comment sums it up. Comments should be allowed to enable freedom of speech but vetted to prevent hate speeches that can invite violence amomgs the citizens
__label__noRel	I agree	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	There are always other spaces, such as reddit or twitter, where one can discuss articles- they do not have to be discussed on the same page they are presented	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	This would reduce comments that may be derogatory and or offensive and in some cases discriminatory.	I kind of agree, but I think that organisations have a responsibility to put something in place to monitor their comment sections. Even if it's not an algorithm and it's an actual person instead! Although your link shows how difficult this would be for a huge organisation like FB.
__label__noRel	Nothing	The use of a system that detect hate speech before publishing
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.

__label__noRel	I agree. Users should be able to to flag harmful comments and report them to a moderator. Users can also counteract damaging comments by refuting the content of the comment, for example, by refering to reliable sources	By allowing a section that briefly educates the viewers regarding the situation before they even get to the part of comment sections.
__label__noRel	It is nice to read things you agree with, and proabaly helps sell newspapers	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	Yes, I would be much more likely to post, read and respond to comments on a website location that is moderated and checked before posting	Hate speech will always appear on open forums. The problem stems from how to stop this from happening.
__label__noRel	i agree with this and awareness should be brought to the surface	I think filtering hate speech comments can do that and allowing a better more positive and a welcome experience to all readers.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	I think that things should be reviewed by a moderator, but it is a tough decision what is considered hate speech and what is someone's opinion.
__label__noRel	But have you considered which one has more serious effects and consequences? I think that should be guiding in the main argument on whether to allow commenting or allow hate speech	I believe the fairest way is the hardest way and that's to have a small group of people moderating REAL hate speech and spam. If someone wants to just use a racist term or promote their website, then these people's comment should be removed and they should be banned from commenting for a period of time. The idea to remove comments entirely is absurd as the news is not trustworthy enough to be the sole voice people hear. We need to hear other voices.
__label__noRel	It's a good idea to reduce anonymity so more people can be linked to the things they say and rightly may think twice about coming across as a hateful person.	ALthough the idea of free speech is important, it cannot be used as an excuse to upset others and use racist/sexist/ violent language.
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	Comment sections need to be well-moderated, and if algoritmic or user comment flagging is used this needs to also be reviewed by a human moderator to ensure that there is no bias or bad faith reporting going on.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	The technical team of the newspaper should select comments that don't promote hate speech and make those comments the only ones that are going to appear on the newspaper's websites.
__label__noRel	I quote "Hate speech is defined as bias-motivated, hostile, malicious speech aimed at a person or a group of people because of some of their actual or perceived innate characteristics." (https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea) If a comment is hate speech, it is mutually exclusive to being valid criticism.	I believe the fairest way is the hardest way and that's to have a small group of people moderating REAL hate speech and spam. If someone wants to just use a racist term or promote their website, then these people's comment should be removed and they should be banned from commenting for a period of time. The idea to remove comments entirely is absurd as the news is not trustworthy enough to be the sole voice people hear. We need to hear other voices.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	Companies aswell as the users should be liable and held accountable for allowing a platform to be used to share hate speech
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	Free speech is a thing	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	I think if all comments go under review for hate speech, that should still allow a chance for hate speech comments to be retracted

__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way.

Some of the comment section of some newspaper articles are not worth reading and may sometimes spoil the reading experience. https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	We need to distinguish between hate speech and political speech. Differences of opinions should not be classed as hate speech.	Hate speech can be controlled by blacklisting keywords on the search engine of a particular blog post/newspapers which will delete any comments that may contain any of the blacklisted keywords.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	I think comments should be limited and all negative comments should be blocked
__label__noRel	Agree. it also highlights the need for work to be done on hate speech/racism. Just because the comments section isn't there, doesn't mean hate speech doesn't exist.	Hate speech can mean different things to different people
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	I believe the following article could provide more information on hate speech, not only in the context of this discussion but as a whole and what can be done to combat it. https://www.stompoutbullying.org/blog/hate-speech
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	I think that keeping a comment section is overall good as it keeps engagement but needs to be heavily moderated and regulated so it doesn't just dissolve into a lot of hate speech and grounds for radicalisation
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	I believe that with real time moderation , if the comments can be removed before causing any distress to people then this is a better option than removing the ability to make comments.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	There should be ways to monitor the type of language used, perhaps through AI. It should be able to pick up key words related to hate speech.
__label__noRel	true	As much as it might seem an attempt to constrict expression of thought, I agree comments should no longer be allowed. It always turns into argument and insult. We already know that for every opinion someone else will take the opposite view. A newspaper's view is its own, so let's keep it that way - we already know which way they lean politically. Keep opinions to social media and let people thrash it out there.
__label__noRel	I think moderators are essential for this job to ensure standards are maintained. For some people comment boards and threads may be their only available way to have their opinion heard. However that shouldn't allow for hate speech to be publicly viewed.	someone to check their posts before the article goes live, like a robot think

The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I believe it is fair for hate speech comments to be censored, because it could lead to violent public behavior. (read this: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech)	It goes further than this. We live in a society that has a lot of cry babies. We need to be impervious to negative comments from strangers on a social platform and that is anonymous. Most people need to grow a pair, develop a spine or stop being cry babies. Once this is achieved you will see that any contribution you make to a discussion will be debated in a civilized manner.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	By blocking comments with offensive words related to the topic, and banning individuals who constantly engage in hate speech.
__label__noRel	I think that people need to be able to post comments but not offend others so I think that it should be policed by the webiste or they need to consider AI to filter out bad comments	people must change, not internet/website
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	There needs to be rules and regulations stating the type of comments that can be made about other people. There should also be verification of a persons identity everytime they make a comment so that is visible who the statement was made by. Newspaper articles should constantly ready and delete hate speech comment.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	No one can be informed about the debate - just the newspapers view - which in and of itself will be from their point of view	The pros of removing comment sections would be to eradicate the spreadof hate speech. Certain individuals thrive on adding fuel to fire. In this case having the comment section deleted would be a positive thing. On the other hand only by having differing opinions can discussions and debates happen. So if someone spews hate speech only then can we see the extent to which someone disagrees with a certain group/viewpoint etc. https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea

__label__noRel	I disagree - people should comment where it is appropriate but not on topics where the public is largely misinformed or can spread misinformation such as climate change. Comments on topics like celebrities are ok because they ultimately don't matter when compared to an important science-policy debate.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	The root cause of most issues is likely from a select few, root out the troublemakers and ban accordingly.
__label__noRel	It may not be elimination, but reduction is better than nothing!	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	i believe that people know what is wrong and what is right. they do know when their comments are harmful	Readers should be able to comment but be informed of certain comments that would be considered hate speech. If they are aware and still choose to comment hateful words, the newspaper website should feel comfortable enough to remove those comments since the reader was informed that comments like those would not be acceptable.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	You have to log on to write a comment, having character/post limits, comments must be verified by someone who checks for hate speech before approving the comment for publication
__label__noRel	That is the problem not everyone thinks that they saying something hateful until someone mentions it.	Filter comments or have a ban on words that come across as hateful.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	user logins can allow for better regulation of comments
__label__noRel	I agree with Richard in so far as newspapers to this point mostly haven't had very successful moderating systems. Either they are unaware of current methods of spreading misinformation or they bring down the ban hammer so quickly that it makes their comments confusing	modrate what can be posted before it allowed to be published finally
__label__noRel	Yep, it needs to be a holistic approach. People have a right to speech but they need to be educated in how to express them kindly.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	It also may be neccesary to use the words, but in light of this would give a person a chance to think before they type, so to speak.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	This would reduce the risk of hate speech.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	That can come with an advantage since people would feel more scared of repercussions in case they do harm other people (basically, if not by empathy, then we use the law).	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	There should be a warning to ban the account of someone who uses hate words in the comment section.

__label__noRel	Human moderators can make good measured contributions and decisions about whether content is ok or not. Ultimately its the newspaper that decides what content it hosts on its website.	Removing the comment section all together is a fair point as news is meant to be fair and impartial. People share their opinions based on their biases and that's not what the news is for - that's what social media is for. But in this case allowing the comment section to remain would be great if people would not abuse the power to share freely by sharing hate speech and slander. us as humans need to be regulated by a set of rules in order to keep a functioning society and i think a filtered comment section is the solution.
__label__noRel	Simultaneously limits freedom of opinion. A censored comment section can hinder thought-provoking discussions	I understand that there will always be people saying the comment section needs to stay as we are all allowed free speech.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	After doing some follow up reading from https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/what-is-online-hate-crime/ I have seen how the anonymity of these online comments can be what makes it so easy for people to be hateful. Therefore, an easy solution would be to make it impossible for people to comment anonymously, and have people have to provide personal information. However, I am not sure how this would work from a data protection point of view. It is certainly a start.
__label__noRel	I agree	The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is often used as a reason not to have readers comments. It seems that this is not a fair argument for eliminating readers comments because of the psychological phenomenon of "cognitive dissonance" - we automatically search for echo chambers in any context.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	i believe commenting should have it's policy, where users have to read the policy before commenting.

__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	Be more strict when allowing people to create profiles, that require identification before allowing anybody to comment.

__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	I'm a firm believer of freedom of speech therefore eliminating it in any form especially because of something that can be regulated like hate speech, to me is ridiculous.
__label__noRel	I agree.

__label__noRel	Agree	I think removing space for comments is not the solution because how else will people discuss the matter at hand or share their opinion. I think hate speech should be set to be hidden from being viewed instread.
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I totally agree with this idea, this would still allow for comments on newspaper websites while at the same time addressing the issue of online hate speech.	There is a fine line between freedom of speech and hate. And hate can be interpreted differently for different people causing biased censorship. Therefore newspapers should have moderators from both sides of opinion that overlook comments to approve before they are published
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	i agree with this, for there to be a clear definition before you post, not terms or rules in small writing	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	I think my idea is very good	I think there should a program that verify the comment before they are displayed on the newpaper
__label__noRel	It reduces hatred	I think that any 'contributors' should have a profile and should not be allowed to use an alias. I also think that there should be moderators looking at every post before it is published online.
__label__noRel	Although i understand why limiting comments would reduce hate speech, unfortunately it then plays to the smaller group in society that causes the problems. The majority of people can have a great debate without taking to name calling etc	We need to create a society where we can debate with each other respectfully, we can know which platforms to use and not rile each other up without offending. It is widely suggested that education can address the extent of hate speech: https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/addressing-hate-speech-through-education-global-education-ministers-conference. However, this needs to go hand in hand with moderation of sites to ensure people are kept within reason. It is not a case of any one single solution.
__label__noRel	hate speech can be aggressive	There should be repercussions to extensive hate speech e.g a limited ban to the forum etc. Use moderators and ensure that users understand the consequences of hate speech commente
__label__noRel	This is a great idea as people can openly speak their opinions without worry of being attacked.	the newspapers should have an algorithm that can detect comments which go against the community guidelines and ban these accounts. Spam accounts should also be detected and banned if they do no contribute constructively to the newspapers.
__label__noRel	Who gets to decide what qualifies as hate speech? If I criticize someone from a protected class for their own bad behavior, what's to stop them from shielding themselves from that criticism by claming it to be hate speech?	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	However some people might argue that what they said is not hate speech, and that the newspaper is trying to censor their opinion	I know this has been discussed a few times potentially in reply to comments but I'd like to repeat it again: language is complex and you can't simply ban or flag certain terms or phrases and think you catch all the hate speech comments etc. While a report button and the use of a software that can support a human moderator is in essence a good idea, it might also delete comments that do not actually contain HS or completely miss others overall. I think this decision by the newspaper turned into an entire discussion of manageability of monitoring discussion sections and away from the ethical considerations.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	Control what is printed or posted to make sure that it is diverse and does not contain any hate speech but the message they are trying to get across they are able to. That way newspaper can leave the comment section and different opinions are heard and expressed and no one gets hurt.
__label__noRel	I agree with this statement. All hate speech can be removed if being monitored properly.	I tend to agree that newspapers should provide spaces for dicussion. It encourages people to read about the topic before making comments and peopel can easily reference reference the article in their comments. I think this allows for a more fruitful and productive discussion that on other platforms e.g. social media. However, hate speech is certainly an issue and easily derails conversations. While moderation of hate speech would be ideal, the burden on the newspaper is likely too great to do this manually. Perhaps a mixture of auto-moderation (flagging/removing key words), manual review by the newspaper and some form of community moderation may work well together.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	I agree with this position since when providing personal data people would be less incentivized to starting hate speach
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Provide guidance on what is and isnt hate speech would work i think
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	I agree, cancelling opinions is reducing free speech, but there needs to be a bar to which all comments are moderated and allowed/prohibited.	Block known accounts with a history of hate speech

Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Reduce hate speech by screening out certain words.

__label__noRel	Hate speech is a probelm, and to discredit any potential help is not the answer. Trials and attempts could be made to fix this issue. A good way to do so would be to use human modetors who are netural, to ensure that there is fairness.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	Hate speech is dangerous because words have power and can influence others to act. It is the denial of acts of tolerance, inclusion, diversity and the very essence of human rights norms and principles. Addressing and countering hate speech is, therefore, a necessity	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	This is a great solution	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	Not allowing them to be anynymous might probably discourage some good-intentioned people to comment as well.	People should be told about hate speech and how it affects other people and I think people who participate in hate speech should have some sort of panishment.
__label__noRel	But what if the opinion of others infringes upon the rights of another. As much as we should all be able to express our opinion it shouldn't be at the expense of others.	Moderation is key. Plenty of newspapers and online media are able to keep comments open with a bit of moderation.
__label__noRel	I think that is a very good idea	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people.

I think we need to develop a way to recognize hate speech in comments so that it is easy to monitor comment sections for derogatory and offensive language.

__label__noRel	Not all opinions can be respected, especially those that violate other people's rights and identities.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	I absolutely agree with this. As we've seen recently (https://medium.com/dfrlab/alt-right-and-alt-social-media-4fa23eb2fbd1) cracking down on the more ofensive comments on one website can lead to groups of people finding a more lenient place and bunching up there, creating a vicious cycle where they push each other to be more and more extreme. It's true that we should monitor the comment section, but overdoing it could lead to worse results somewhere else.	Many people are against the reducing of hate speech from newspaper article, and I am with them on this. The main reason for putting comment section on newspaper websites was for readers to leave a comment, people will always have something to say whether it is good or bad. But AI can still be used to remove comments that can be severely harmful.
__label__noRel	i agree with not remove the comment section because of the censorship	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	Is it necessary to have readers comments? What do they add to the article?
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	Although it might be unfair for others, I think majority can agree that removing the comment section will be helpful because then it means anyone that has an opinion can rather call the newspaper.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	Allow users to report comments.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Hate speech blocking should not be implemented, people must learn to take some criticism in a positive way, it can be helpful.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?

We need to create a society where we can debate with each other respectfully, we can know which platforms to use and not rile each other up without offending. It is widely suggested that education can address the extent of hate speech: https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/addressing-hate-speech-through-education-global-education-ministers-conference. However, this needs to go hand in hand with moderation of sites to ensure people are kept within reason. It is not a case of any one single solution.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	I'd happily see all comments sections removed for the good of the public in general. Nobody needs to know that Tony from Bognor thinks All Them Lot Should Go Home, because Tony is a twat who shouldn't be given a platform.
__label__noRel	true	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	I agree with most of the commenters here, there needs to be moderation. Even if you don't agree with the arguments there are ways of saying it that do not fall into 'hate speech'.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	People are allowed to have different views on certain topics and to engage with others on newspaper websites but this will be prevented by hate speech which may make other readers to stop reading
__label__noRel	Punishments would be good but also a mixture of education and this could help. Hate speech is a very person-by-person thing, what some may think isn't, some may think is.	That would take away free speech, however I think they need to add some sort of AI that can immediately pick up any forms of hate speech and immediately delete or even block it
__label__noRel	Common sense is not common	I feel that all users should provide true identification that can be used if they use hate speech to find them/report them.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	We need a more thick skin with some of our debate topics if we want to win arguements against "hate"
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Hate speech invites violence and undermines people
__label__noRel	A perceived reputable source, but can have political leanings and opinions.	Removing the comment space from online newspapers is definitely not fair but I believe that it should be regulated by A-I. This way readers could share different opinions and thoughts abut the topic at hand without offending one another.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	i agree repercussions should happen to the people who post hate comments	A lot of the times I hear people railing against the censorship of hatespeech it is because they aren't aware of the damage they are causing or have been caught out saying something they didn't think was bad to begin with. I think that anything that is removed should be explained to the poster as well as the impact that t could have on other people
__label__noRel	Its unlikely there will be such software that recognises all slang / racist words	I believe some sort of regulation in media will always be necessary to decrease the damage hate speech might cause -- comments space included. We still need to get to the bottom of the issue, though.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	in my opinion there should be no comment section , article should be true and commenting no needed
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	Please read this article - https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/11/30/how-online-hate-speech-is-fueling-real-life-violence/
__label__noRel	I absolutely agree with that position. As much as I hope and believe people should not resort to hate speech, but rather have a civilized conversation and respect each other's opinions, I am aware people might simply not be capable of that. Also - hate speech is not illegal in most countries. Quote from Wikipedia: "While "hate speech" is not a legal term in the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that most of what would qualify as hate speech in other western countries is legally protected free speech under the First Amendment." Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_in_the_United_States	readers comments be moderated and anything that is harmful, hateful or hurtful should be removed. this allows people to exercise their right of freedom of speech but limiting the harm that someones opinion may have
__label__noRel	I think using personal data would be tricky. Many companies have been caught selling user's data without consent or storing it in an unsafe way, which could harm those affected by hate speech more than those who post it	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Our freedom to do anything as part of a society is limited. Thus freedom of speech should be no different. Poeple need to be held accountable for their mistakes, so everybody else's rights will be protected. So having a set of keywords which are not allowed to be used is a way of reminding the writter that using the offensive word he/she is trying to use is considered a crime. An additional way to handle that is having the flag option by users and a team of moderators who follow a standard and will verify if flagged comments should be maintained or not. Lastly, anonymity might bring a feeling of impunity and even its possibility, so a way to avoid that is allowing one profile per person/email, where a fake username can be set, but, in the backstage, the website will know who it is that wrote each comment.
__label__noRel	The problem is establishing standards can be quite subjective and cause users to complain about censorship...	create a team of people that can look for and remove the hate speech and leave all other respectful arguments to make the comment section diverse.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	Being able to track down those who have posted hate speech would be useful in putting a stop to them and may discourage those who like to post things anonymously from posting in the first place	I think the comments should be monitored to avoid hate speech
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	i agree that sometimes criticism isn't always bad, especially if the article is unfair as they regularly are	hate speech must be clearly defined, it should not be left to the media to decide what is and is not considered hate speech
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	It is important to allow people to express their view to abide with freedom of speech. However, having the option to view these comment with a warning would allow people to ignore potential hate speech comments but still lets them read it if they want to.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	There should be automatic filters but they are not 100, so there should also be a team of people constanly monitoring and reviewing complaints and reports. I feel like it is the only way to keep the freedom of speech but also protect people who might be victims of it.

The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	I think that moderation is the most effective way of preventing hate speech. Filtering comments would not work as it is difficult to find a algorithm for the context of a comment. Free speech is so important it should not be removed.
__label__noRel	removing comment sections takes away the chance to interact with others about a topic you care about	the removal of comment spaces is not good for the well being of humans because other people share ideas using the comment space and other comments can make certain people happy.
__label__noRel	I believe if almost everyone who knows about hate speech will know what to say and what not to say.	Hate speech can be positive criticism and essential in some posts, altgough it can be offensive and totally uncalled for in other posts. A way in which social media apps regulate and monitor the comments, otherwise people have rights to freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I think also need to consider the peoples rights and ensure that they reduce the hate speech and increasingly integrate many forms of social media into their intimate, social and political lives, produce, are exposed to, and combat hate speech online.	I don't believe removing the comment section will help remove hate speech, but having a system that can track the device and the people that use that device can go a long way in removing trolls from a community platform and prevent them from becoming repeat offenders.
__label__noRel	I think moderation is better than asking for a lot of personal data.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	I believe that people are allowed to express their opinions , that is why we have freedom of speech. However with that right, we are not subjected to hate speech, there are so many ways of expressing yourself without using offensive or hateful words. Considering a newspaper is a public platform, I believe everyone should try to be respective at all times. The comment space must not be removed, it helps to get insights of readers and is very helpful. I think the website should be enhanced in a way that it detects offensive language and doesn't allow the reader to continue if they use such. Also, comments should be monitored before being posted to the public.
__label__noRel	true, but maybe they can remove anonymity so that everyone can be accountable for what they say.	I don't think newspapers, who have already seen their takings plummet in recent years due to everything moving online, will want to pay to employ moderators for their articles. They would need to have a pretty high number of mods in order to keep up as each newspaper carries so many articles. This topic is a massive minefield and I don't think there is a simple solution to it.
__label__noRel	I don't think most people would take the time to educate each other about hate speech, and I assume there will be stubborn people that are stuck in their ways and will continue to comment their hateful opinions.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	Is it actually their responsibilty?
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	The newspaper website platform owners should be held accountable for any hate speech that occurs on their website and they can combat hate speech allowing fellow readers to be able to flag/report posts that they deem hateful.The moderators can then investigate.
__label__noRel	I agree	In today's world where technology has advanced to such a degree, I'm of the belief that creating parameters that protect individuals from any form of hate speech is very much possible through things such as AI. The removing of commenting sections could be argued as a violation to one's freedom of speech, it also means the views and opinions of the public will be lost which could have detrimental effects.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	Hate speech can mean different things to different people
__label__noRel	IT is absoluety the websites job to police polirising comments if nesccearry to keep peace wihthin the outiside community viewing their newspapers.	"Freedom of Speech'...that's a popular consensus among the masses, regardless of the "casualities" that are left on the wayside. Having reread a lot of the comments posted here, I do consider the possibility of having people comment as they wish, politically correct or not. HOWEVER, let there be consequences involved, such as naming and shaming, and acquring user details if need be, after all, things such as cyber crime, online harrassment, etc do exist, am I right? And so, if such a comment borders on this, let it become a criminal matter and have law enforcement dealing specifically in cyber-related crimes become involved. Problem solved.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	I think with careful moderation, there's nothing wrong with keeping the comments section. Reddit is a fine example of extremely good moderation combined with bots that immediately remove content with insults and hatespeech.
__label__noRel	This leaves space for people to bully and be toxic without any consequences	Every person should be traceable, so they are accountable. If your comments consist of hate speech or are offensive then you be accounable.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	By a combination of monitoring and blocking people who leave such comments, and also having suitable laws in place to back this up
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	I know this has been discussed a few times potentially in reply to comments but I'd like to repeat it again: language is complex and you can't simply ban or flag certain terms or phrases and think you catch all the hate speech comments etc. While a report button and the use of a software that can support a human moderator is in essence a good idea, it might also delete comments that do not actually contain HS or completely miss others overall. I think this decision by the newspaper turned into an entire discussion of manageability of monitoring discussion sections and away from the ethical considerations.
__label__noRel	reasonable discussion and points	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it.

I believe some sort of regulation in media will always be necessary to decrease the damage hate speech might cause -- comments space included. We still need to get to the bottom of the issue, though.
__label__noRel	Yes people are very technological savvy and capable of using fake accounts to continue spreading whatever comments without consideration and that makes it hard to trace them.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Anonymity may also prevent people to explore ideas they feel are taboo and prevent them from seeking help. e.g. addiction, some LGBTQ+ issues that are taboo in certain cultures etc.	People should be told about hate speech and how it affects other people and I think people who participate in hate speech should have some sort of panishment.
__label__noRel	Spam calls	Removing the comment section all together is a fair point as news is meant to be fair and impartial. People share their opinions based on their biases and that's not what the news is for - that's what social media is for. But in this case allowing the comment section to remain would be great if people would not abuse the power to share freely by sharing hate speech and slander. us as humans need to be regulated by a set of rules in order to keep a functioning society and i think a filtered comment section is the solution.

__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks.

While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__noRel	More understanding	Newspaper websites should use human or artificial intelligence-based moderators who can impartially identify hate speech and remove it from their platforms without removing or censoring genuine, constructive comments and perspectives. If AI is used, certain terms and phrases can be added to a database and comments containing them flagged for moderation to remove hate speech fairly.
__label__noRel	freedom of speech is important but not at the cost of other rights	I do not think it is possible, in a fair and just way. When speech is restricted that's called censorship. Who would justify the restrictive opinion?
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	the fairly way of reducing hate speech from newspapers website is not allowing anyone to comment that is to bloc the comment section.
__label__noRel	I agree, the comment section should likely remain but be heavily moderated and regulated to disallow hate speech as the article above says	I think newspapers websites should have an online system that can detect hate speech and block users that use this kind of language but keeping it open for negative or positive feedback would be fair but not giving readers the freedom to use hate speech.

__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	I think there should be moderators on articles that make the comments. less visible so offensive comments can have a warning before viewing

__label__noRel	Shows an active moderation panel.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	I appreciate the balance here.	Comments are important as it can help create a balanced view and promote healthy discussion, maybe software could pick up on key words or phrases and then a moderator could look more in depth at questionable comments.
__label__noRel	I agree, but trolls want to be trolls if they wanted to be trolls. People should be held accountable as well.	Just pay moderators

Hate speech is an attack, a threat, or prehudice speech.
__label__noRel	Whilst I agree that the platforms should be responsible, with the vast numbers of people contributing to some platforms it is virtually impossible to moderate every single comment.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	By ticking a box to agree not to be abusive or hateful before being allowed to comment
__label__noRel	Who is to say what is or isn't 'harmful'? It sounds like you want to control a good chunk of the population who don't agree with you on things.	Newspaper should avoid subscription from people who use hate speech
__label__noRel	so moderators and filters are needed	What is characterised as hate speech needs to be assessed on a case by case basis. It is not absolute
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks.

Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	Exactly the newspapers must be the place to comment because they give us the article but this article is written by a journalist. Therefore, the article represent the ideas of the journalist. Not all the time they are neutral. Sometimes they are even politically influenced. This often provokes discussions and where else can people say their opinion if there is no comment section?	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	Perhaps this would put too much power in the hands of arbiters. But if those who partake in submitting 'hate' comments were to be traced, they should end up in the Courts, not be 'educated'.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	The same technology that allows social media to galvanise democratic activists can be used by hate groups seeking to organise and recruit. It also allows fringe sites, including peddlers of conspiracies, to reach audiences far broader than their core readership. Online platforms’ business models depend on maximising reading or viewing times. Since Facebook and similar platforms make their money by enabling advertisers to target audiences with extreme precision, it is in their interests to let people find the communities where they will spend the most time.https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons	The best way to reduce hate speech would be to make sure that moderators are present to check on comments, it would not be advisable to cancel comments completely due the feedback it gives and people will always have their opinions and sometimes they will involve hate speech, which is unavoidable...
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	There should be ways to monitor the type of language used, perhaps through AI. It should be able to pick up key words related to hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree, there is a certain level in which the elimination of hate speech overrules the need for comments	The comments could be checked for hateful speech. For example, there could be a bot or something (I do not know the exact name) that checks for any hateful words and eliminate that comment.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	I believe that with real time moderation , if the comments can be removed before causing any distress to people then this is a better option than removing the ability to make comments.
__label__noRel	According to a recent survey by Morningconsult, 80% of people want to see all forms of hate speech removed. https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/social-media-firms-moderate-content/	Unfortunately, the public's view on acts of terrorism (including domestic) can be strongly swayed by the effective use of such innocent feeling things as comment sections, as these groups may flood such sections underneath reporting of their own acts with sympathetic or 'this isn't an issue' type posts, thus influencing others' opinions directly or indirectly.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	A possible way to address hate speech on newspaper sites would be to incorporate both human moderators and some sort of AI that monitors for hateful words and comments. The requirement to submit personally identifying information before commenting might also help because without this then anyone can create a fake name that hides the person's true identity so therefore more likely to engage in hate speech. If personal information is required, then hate speech would be less likely.
__label__noRel	If the newspaper website does not monitor the comments on their platform then who will? They have just as much responsibility to stop hate speech as the public and need to be involved in this issue.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	No censoring of opinions	I was completely taken aback by some strong stances to remove the comment space, and the belief in that because Newspapers should be one-sided providers. I would disagree because newspaper share societal information and society should be allowed to engage and be part of the conversation instead of just consuming whatever information is being released for consumption. It has been seen as a result of other newspaper websites removing the comment section that it reduces the trust of the reader because they are aware of the bias of the information they are consuming, and also it reduces the amount of time readers spend on these sites because there is no community engagements.

__label__noRel	I disagree. This limits the freedom of speech of people and for people to be able to give their opinion and potentially challenge the thoughts of the newspaper. I agree that this should be done in a respectful way.	Agreeing with others here: a standard of moderation would have to be communicated to the user, with straightforward policies of flagging or reporting potentially hateful comments. A synthesis of live and algorithmic moderators might be best, as certain words can be auto-flagged for review, whereas other things might involve a more delicate touch.
__label__noRel	1	Educate people about it
__label__noRel	I don't think the intention is to be aggressive but sometimes expressing yourself may lead to saying things that hurt other people.	https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/19/npr-comments-decision-guardian-readers
__label__noRel	I agree	Just allow people to report bad comments and when it gets to a certain number it should delete the message and send an automatic email to the person who wrote it with a warning.
__label__noRel	good idea but you nead the right person with a good moral compass on board,to give a level playing field for all.	having moderators approve comments
__label__noRel	posting hate is not freedom of speech	Ultimately the comments are needed to gather feedback in certain situations, removing the comments section wouldn't help us eliminate hate speech because where information needs to be gathered, no blacklist will help.
__label__noRel	Completely correct, effective moderation is the answer.	Is it actually their responsibilty?
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	People will say whatever they want even mean things and say it is free speech.People should learn to be kind to others without using free speech as an excuse	Despite my defence of human moderators, it seems they too are flawed -- check out this article https://www.technologynetworks.com/informatics/news/ai-trusted-as-much-as-humans-to-flag-hate-speech-365777 -- human moderators are not only prone to bias but also impractical. With the huge wealth of content posted every second online, it is unrealistic to expect humans to be able to view, criticise, and moderate every single comment.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	Professionality	Newspaper websites should invest more in technology that can be used to detect hate speech and not allow it to be posted. They should only allow comments posted in the language that the software will understand so that it is able to eliminate hate speech without difficulties. they should also be willing to punish people who post hate speech by reporting them to the authorities.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	By using a tool that searches for likely words: hate, etc.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	This is not a black or white topic. The question is how exactly we define hate speech. Criticism in itself is not hate speech, but it is easy to take things to extremes, especially when someone expresses their opinion anonymously. Education about the reasons is important to better understand our own feelings and behaviour. Educate people do not restrict them!
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Comments could be checked for hate speech before going live.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	I think I would prefer to see that comments sections are removed rather than untruths being pushed at people.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	There is a fine line between free speech and hate speech. I don't think there is any way to reduce this because people will take the stand and say that their free speech is being taken away from them.
__label__noRel	Online would be a nicer place	Advanced AI is the ultimate answer. It is the cheapest and most unbiased moderator option.
__label__noRel	I agree with Dominic , who becomes judge of what is true, what is without bias, what is hateful versus what is simply disagree, disapprove, dislike. Do we say happy things only and simply create artifical safe spaces where only positive ego boosting comments are allowed?	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	people who comment hate speech should be banned
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	Unfortunately, the public's view on acts of terrorism (including domestic) can be strongly swayed by the effective use of such innocent feeling things as comment sections, as these groups may flood such sections underneath reporting of their own acts with sympathetic or 'this isn't an issue' type posts, thus influencing others' opinions directly or indirectly.
__label__noRel	It would save people wasting time leaving unecessary comments on often trivial matters. Its like people who ring up the radio, most people dont bother or care. Those who do are usually idiots or have more extreme opinions.	We can start by encouraging people to debate and say their opinions to incite meaningful and helpful conversations and comments instead of hate and other harmful communication types
__label__noRel	Hate speech can spread rapidly, and destroy lives. It is offensive, hurtful and can ruin people. I think this is a very bad opinion to take.	the comments with hate speech can be remove. and the commenter should be ban for a period of time
__label__noRel	I agree. Users should be able to to flag harmful comments and report them to a moderator. Users can also counteract damaging comments by refuting the content of the comment, for example, by refering to reliable sources	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	up to this point, moderators have done a poor job as evidenced by the amount of hate speech so maybe the answer is simply to remove the ability to comment.
__label__noRel	the website could give raise this this awareness and have a open discusion	We need to create a society where we can debate with each other respectfully, we can know which platforms to use and not rile each other up without offending. It is widely suggested that education can address the extent of hate speech: https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/addressing-hate-speech-through-education-global-education-ministers-conference. However, this needs to go hand in hand with moderation of sites to ensure people are kept within reason. It is not a case of any one single solution.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	I think this is a task that is hard to do because it has to be done in a way that would not hinder freedom of speech but at the same time not attack people. Thus, I think comments should be flagged depending on the words used but not be deleted until it has been checked.
__label__noRel	I agree	Everyone shoould be able to express their own ideas but we could have some kind of protection in words the should not be allowed and also have a way to keep moderators on the website, people could be warned that they are doing something wrong and be explained that there IS NO HATE SPEECH and be offered maybe some way to express herself without hurting or damaging others.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	An article proving AI can be helpful, but can struggle to interpret or detect certain things, suggesting manual reviewing is still very important. https://www.latrobe.edu.au/nest/can-combat-rise-online-hate-speech/ On another note, I also think anonymity plays a huge role in what people allow themselves to post online and think that certain platforms should consider only allowing people to comment under their own identity rather than online handles and such.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	Removing the comment section from online newspapers is not the answer. Allowing people to post their opinions is healthy and a normal part of human society- people will not always agree. However, in order to reduce hate speech, which can so often lead to crime, it could be done so that there are monitors (either human or computer) who check comments before they are posted to ensure they are not hate speech.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	In my opinion the comment section should not be removed. I personally get very annoyed if I watch or read something and want to express my opinion, then go down to the comment section to sadly find out the comments are turned off. This limits the freedom of speech and blocks the ability for the people to vent out somehow. I think this builds aggression and causes problems afterwards. The better thing to do is to limit bad speech, foul words and cursing but removing the comments completely is not a good idea.
__label__noRel	comments can be important to portray the views of the opposing 'side' of the narrative of the article	We need to be very clear about what constitutes hate speech and create severe punishments for those that spread it.
__label__noRel	Polarization is necessary, without it newspapers would be able to deliver any information to the public uncontested.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	I think also need to consider the peoples rights and ensure that they reduce the hate speech and increasingly integrate many forms of social media into their intimate, social and political lives, produce, are exposed to, and combat hate speech online.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	This could be done through public opinion, such as what the general public would consider less restricted and what is acceptable in current society.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	The author of the post can moderate all comments before allowing them on the page. This does present the issue that only the author's views will be portrayed
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	By putting in a classing program that will read and class information as it enters. That way things will work nicely and we wont see more of hate speech
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	In a survey of news sites it was found that on average 11% of comments are removed...some of these are because they are spam and some because they are offensive. I think that the fact that it's more than one in two really shows how necessary moderation is, these issues are so common. Source: https://netino.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/WAN-IFRA_Online_Commenting.pdf (pg 7)
__label__noRel	There could be a risk with this. In an article from 2016 (https://www.jstor.org/stable/44014621) Flaxman et al. make the following point in their abstract: 'the vast majority of online news consumption is accounted for by individuals simply visiting the home pages of their favorite, typically mainstream, news outlets'. If this is the case, it's possible that the 'diverse' opinions will be in a cycle of one sided shared opinions, and few 'other' or opposed opinions. These could well end up being quite extreme, and the policy to include other opinions could well serve the opposite function of promoting hate speech when it is a massive minority.....maybe.	Hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by educating people about the consequences of hate speech and what they can do to someone else.
__label__noRel	so moderators and filters are needed	Nice. Your comment sums it up. Comments should be allowed to enable freedom of speech but vetted to prevent hate speeches that can invite violence amomgs the citizens
__label__noRel	That is an interesting point. It would need to be an impartial party. I know sometimes FB and other social media platforms use algorithms to hide certain posts (usually due to language) so maybe that could be one answer?	Hire moderators and similar positions, and also having filtering systems
__label__noRel	The problem is that hate speech laws differ from country to country. The UN has a set of rules (https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech?gclid=Cj0KCQjw48OaBhDWARIsAMd966B8prXQ12vsyA9iPNzeoJiBpSFAuLJFh4j4_h5QJe48gd8MVKZ4eHQaAiPWEALw_wcB) but that does not mean all countries obey and follow them. Taking away opinion from topics would mean you would not know how other feel about an topic or article all in the name of hate speech. Therefore, it would create a miss understood society.	i am totally against any form of censorship in newspaper comment sections
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Through active moderation.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	A lot of the times I hear people railing against the censorship of hatespeech it is because they aren't aware of the damage they are causing or have been caught out saying something they didn't think was bad to begin with. I think that anything that is removed should be explained to the poster as well as the impact that t could have on other people
__label__noRel	Totally agree but the team of moderators might be a high cost for the newspaper, especially if they need to evaluate every comment	The best thing would be to have some sort of app that monitors and regulate the language used. in a case where hate speech is found in a comment, the sentence should be blurred out.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	people feel powerful behind an anonymous account, its easier to say things you would never normally say under the guise of anonymity, if it was easier to link a comment to who it came from and if people actually faced consequences from posting hate then this could help stop it.
__label__noRel	Fixing the root cause would be most beneficial.	Having read all of the previous discussion surrounding this debate, I still stand by my original opinion. Moderating comments by an official representative of the newspaper doesn't allow for free speech. We do however, need to eliminate hate speech. I think the best way to do this is to put this in the hands of the community and other readers.
__label__noRel	true	Allow others users to rate the comments and block those who receive bad ratings
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	We need to let people have their opinions spoken. Removing the comment space is not a good option. Instead, we need to better educate people on what's good and what's bad.
__label__noRel	Moderators will allow for fair reviiews	My position as a reader and my argument is that bases on the rules of speech people have freedom of speech and expression. That should be done in a proper way without insulting others or hating or being racist in your speech. Websites and newspapers should not remove the comments of the people responding to hate speech. This is done according to the rules found in the following article: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230
__label__noRel	This is one of the most sane posts in this discussion. Thank you.	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	eliminating the comment section is more like taking peoples freedoms away as people have the right to freedom of expression	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	I think this is a bad idea. The comments section is an important means of debunking biased articles or potentially gaining a different perspective on what others think about what you've just read.	Everyone is entitled to freedom of speech but hate speech can be detrimental to readers and the topics mental health. I think the best way to deal with hate speech is to have filtered comments, raising awareness and age restrictions on wensites and comment sections
__label__noRel	Agreed, it's totally problematic once you start to censor opinion over simply bad language and obvious hate speech.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	It could help return newspapers to places where people seek news rather than skip content to get to simply debate/abuse!	Having the option for complete anonimity and alter egos should be removed. I believe people will be much more careful with what they say if their name and face is attached to it.
__label__noRel	i enjoy reading comments but some comments can be sweary,name calling, troll like behaviour, which should be stopped.	One way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for reader comments would to have active community managers who are activetly managing the comment section. Making sure that all comments are in accordance to the community guidelines.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	we should keep comment sections on newspaper websites but we should have moderators to filter out any hate speech
__label__noRel	I agree	I agree with some other opinions on the use of A1 to flag or censor certain words that constitute hate or violent speech. It would also be beneficial to have a human supervisor from the organisation and another external body review the activities of the AI to ensure accuracy and consistency.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	we could use bots the get triggered when certain words are used. The bot will therefore remove the comment andhold it until it has mannually reviewed by a human. Another option can be to allow the users to report comments from other users and if the reports reach a certain threshold then hold that comment for review.
__label__noRel	you cannot control people and there opinions.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	I agree	exclude certain words from being posted
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Maybe if the comments were better moderated then this would reduce the amount of hate speech.

__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	Maybe the only solution is to remove the space for comments? We see the same issues on other platforms that allow comments!
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	you can add an AI system in the website that will scan all comments instantly after they have been posted and it can remove any hate speech before it is seen by many people on the comment section, this method is used by some online communication platforms.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	There could be a segment in the website that gives informed context to a subject to prevent uninformed comments and furthermore the newspaper should monitor the comments and censor any hate speech comments.
__label__noRel	Allowing hate speech, only perpetuates prejudice and discrimination.	Could ensure moderation of commonly used words for hate speech, and frequent moderation on these websites
__label__noRel	We should avoid appearing like we are doing cancel culture	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	would definitely need a team of moderators	Newspapers should have an algorithm that catches certain words or phrases which are hateful in nature. These words will be automatically flagged up and accounts that are flagged x amount of times should then be restricted from commenting for a period of time. If after this period, they continue to try and post comments with hateful content, they should be banned entirely from commenting.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	There should be hate speech words that should be used to warn the user and not allow them to post by disabling the post button if there are hate speech words.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	Removing the comment section should not be an option, we should not lose the right to freedom of speech based on the likelihood that a few may post hateful comments, strict moderation and being able to report hate speech is the solution. Having people sign up for platforms and use ID to which they could be held personally accountable is an option as well. Hate Speech often comes from being able to hide behind a keyboard, screen and a fake username.
__label__noRel	i agree with this	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	Allow users to report comments.
__label__noRel	In the book "Noise" it talks about taking the median for everyones view and making that the regulation. The conversation then becomes which views qualify as each end of this opinion spectrum? Surely not the hateful ones but a modicum of their views so they feel included instead of fuelling their distrust of systems not built for them.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	Hate speech can be positive criticism and essential in some posts, altgough it can be offensive and totally uncalled for in other posts. A way in which social media apps regulate and monitor the comments, otherwise people have rights to freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	But software is not near good enough to accurately identify hate speech all the time. Language is complex and you can't pin HS through banning or flagging certain terms and phrases only.	There should be a strict comment management system in place, someone has to supervise it and react (and possibly penalise) to users spreading hate speech. The comments should not be anonymous since people feel more inclined to be hostile when hiding under a pseudonym. Maybe asking to verify your identity before posting a comment would make people think more before spreading hate.
__label__noRel	If they are allowed to make their comments through other channels of communication then I agree.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	i dont think being able to use hate speech, racist/homophobic language	A pop-up can be used which reads "if any 'hate speech' comment is discovered, it will be removed from these comments".
__label__noRel	We shape our social lives in physical space all the time. We now 'live' also in a digital world. We can shape our digital lives and we must do this by not taking the "easy" way out, by using the tools at our disposal and by questioning and creating new tools to control our digital space.	the website should have terms and conditions on the words that can be used and warnings if failure to follow the recommended words .
__label__noRel	the problem is that people are not happy and that has a reason	A reporting site that is accessible across all platforms would be a good start like https://www.report-it.org.uk/reporting_internet_hate_crime.
__label__noRel	In principle a great idea, in practice this requires more money be spent on moderators and system updates	According to newsy.com, between January and March 2022, Meta took action on more than 15 million pieces of hate speech content on Facebook. Roughly 95% of that was detected proactively by Facebook with the help of AI - https://www.newsy.com/stories/artificial-intelligence-is-used-to-track-down-hate-speech/#:~:text=Between%20January%20and%20March%202022,themes%20fall%20through%20the%20cracks.
__label__noRel	I agree that most if not all online news articles do not need a comments section. However, I believe having a note to tell readers to be well mannered would not stop readers from posting hate speech if they had intended to do so in the first place.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	agree	You have to log on to write a comment, having character/post limits, comments must be verified by someone who checks for hate speech before approving the comment for publication
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	The newspapers should encourage the victims of hate speech to report hate speech published, establish monitoring and evaluation units in newsrooms. Some units should be tasked with monitoring hate speech trends, compiling reports and bringing these to the attention of key institutions
__label__noRel	Galliah, Shelly A would seem to agree	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	Develop AI which is able to detect and delete hate speech automatically.
__label__noRel	Reduces hate speech	I believe comment sections should be moderated more to prevent the obvious hate speech and statements that do not add anything useful to the discussion
__label__noRel	I agree	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I support this, moderation should be visible.	People can express them selves however they like but they must be mindful to their language.
__label__noRel	I agree this article https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/03/29/the-future-of-free-speech-trolls-anonymity-and-fake-news-online/ speaks about hthis also. Being anon givens comfortability and lets people hide behind a false identity, taking that away would likely reduce hate speech on popular newspaper outlets out of fear of being identified. However, those with these views would likely continue on more far-right news outlets	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	I think there should at least be a 'report' button and any hate speech reported should be removed.
__label__noRel	Need clear understanding of what is considered hate speech on this platform.	Hate speech should not be allowed to dominate the narrative as it defeats the process and hinders effective communication. As a result, flagging and blocking of problematic accounts can prove to be effective in combating the spread of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree, some people will attack you without getting the context of the article and latter on realise that they where wrong. At time is already late	I think the best way to reduce hate speech in newspaper websites is to ensure that the site can detect words and phrases that can be considered hate speech, and block them from being posted on the comment section. Also, a moderator to approve each comment section before it becomes publicly accessible is a notion which can be adopted as well.
__label__noRel	This puts the power in many people's hands	Removing the comment section from online newspapers is not the answer. Allowing people to post their opinions is healthy and a normal part of human society- people will not always agree. However, in order to reduce hate speech, which can so often lead to crime, it could be done so that there are monitors (either human or computer) who check comments before they are posted to ensure they are not hate speech.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	i agree that people have the right to express their own ideas but you have to be considerate otherwise it can easily be interpreted as hate if your not careful with wordings.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	block swearing, abusive, discrimatory words- freedom of speech without rasicism, name calling etc
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	I think that any 'contributors' should have a profile and should not be allowed to use an alias. I also think that there should be moderators looking at every post before it is published online.
__label__noRel	who decides which words are to be blocked and which are not, some people may find certain words offence while others may not.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	If comments that create hate speech are removed/moderated, you can not complain about loss of freedom of speech as you are then being discrimantory, rather than speaking freely, and there is a difference.
__label__noRel	true, but maybe they can remove anonymity so that everyone can be accountable for what they say.	You can let people create an account with a full name so they will have to think more about what they write and can't so easily spew hate
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	online newspaper will definately attract a lot of people if there is comment section as some people prefer to go through comments first to get insight of the content.
__label__noRel	Taking away hate speech may not allow the audience to actually continue to express any opinions at all	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	Other comments can also make other people sad	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	Newspapers should be a pleasure to read and not make you angry after reading comments not having comments will make them more pleasurable to read again.
__label__noRel	Because some peoples opinions can be hurtful to others	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	We should all think before we comment freedom of speech does come with responsibilities	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	this outs a limit on free speech	due to the changing world and the improvement of technology,the internet is like a black canvas and anyone can put anything they want on it,but even though technology is improving most websites dont use basic protection,they could do things like add comment filters,then this ensures that hateful words or phrases cannot be used but positive and informative words and statements can be
__label__noRel	no one will be mortally offended if everything is made bland by the removal of all contentious discussion	I think that moderation is the most effective way of preventing hate speech. Filtering comments would not work as it is difficult to find a algorithm for the context of a comment. Free speech is so important it should not be removed.
__label__noRel	everyone has the right to share their opinions, however online comments make it too easy for hate and discrimination to be spread with out consequences. There needs to be a way to stop the hate spreading but also still give people the oppertunity to express their comments so i think this is a good idea	comment sections should not be removed as that will prevent those with positive comments form sharing their thoughts, they should instead be reviewed regulary so that hate speech is flagged and removed another solution is for comments to be approved by moderators before they go public
__label__noRel	I disagree with this because newspapers can lose readers due to poor interaction	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	people feel powerful behind an anonymous account, its easier to say things you would never normally say under the guise of anonymity, if it was easier to link a comment to who it came from and if people actually faced consequences from posting hate then this could help stop it.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	flag all the comments that contain vulgar words and warn the sender. the comment must be rephrased, failure to do so must result in the suspension of the sender from commenting
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	I think there has to be a system that can verify whether a person's comment contains hate speech and if it is found to contain hate speech, that person should not be allowed to leave the comment.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	There could be a risk with this. In an article from 2016 (https://www.jstor.org/stable/44014621) Flaxman et al. make the following point in their abstract: 'the vast majority of online news consumption is accounted for by individuals simply visiting the home pages of their favorite, typically mainstream, news outlets'. If this is the case, it's possible that the 'diverse' opinions will be in a cycle of one sided shared opinions, and few 'other' or opposed opinions. These could well end up being quite extreme, and the policy to include other opinions could well serve the opposite function of promoting hate speech when it is a massive minority.....maybe.

__label__noRel	encourages social participation and reflection	i am against the removal of the comment section and i believe that regulations and clear rules are the way to go, have systems put into place and enforce the rules. let there be punishable offences for rule breakers.
__label__noRel	It should not be made known to the public that certain comments have been deleted because it discourages participation. REMOVE THEM IN SECRET.	monitor the comments that are posted
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Not possible to to it completely, hate spech can be quite subtle. Needs real time moderation.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	Sometimes being harsh can be kind to the person who may not realise what they're doing.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	Education is a great tool but essentially your website gives the solution without the steps. First people need to learn how to disarm the person they're debating with to educate them, which most people don't have the finesse to do. How do you change someones views when they're defensive from start to finish of your conversation?	As I saw some commentary on this platform, my opinion is that we need 2 things. A submission of personal data before one can have access to post anything related and real time moderation of the comments. Big platforms like YouTube, Instagram and others are held accountable for their users' actions and they have had a lot of success so far.

__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	Asking for their constructive criticism and how it will benefit the individual and community.
__label__noRel	Absolutely agree with this. Newspapers will moderate comments that do not agree with their agenda.	https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-63291527
__label__noRel	Banning comments only based on keywords will remove certain comments fore sure but won't help in reducing hate speech	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	In order to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. Active communinty management and moderation is required. This helps keep people in line with the community guildelines.
__label__noRel	I agree on the usefulness of a report button.	I think you can put a price to the website- a subscription to readers.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	Identifying users with hate speech and restricting their accounts from using the platform and commenting on it.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	Absolutely, vague definitions are the downfall of effective communication. A lot like "Karen" replacing the actual words for situations like racist, entitled, rude, emotionally volatile, unreasonable etc. When we all hold a different definition for a word because it's been used too broadly it becomes harder to communicate. Clearly defining what hate speech is with links to the definitions in every format is what could help. People consume information more effectively in different modes like audio, visual, written etc.	I don't think removing the comment section reduces hate speech per se, it just pushes it elsewhere. I can't help feeling this sort of censorship is an infringement on free speech.
__label__noRel	If we need other peoples opinions before we can form our own then we are literally just looking for confirmation bias of what we already believe	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	It goes further than this. We live in a society that has a lot of cry babies. We need to be impervious to negative comments from strangers on a social platform and that is anonymous. Most people need to grow a pair, develop a spine or stop being cry babies. Once this is achieved you will see that any contribution you make to a discussion will be debated in a civilized manner.
__label__noRel	true, but maybe they can remove anonymity so that everyone can be accountable for what they say.	We need to block the users that use hate speech and filter the comments that have any form of hate speech.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	have an AI to scan and analyse trigger words, then the alert is passed to a human reviewer then can say whether or not it's hate speech
__label__noRel	https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3490499?casa_token=HD2SvDug2z8AAAAA%3AXgh7WUUzUa2Cds1w5IJne06EuRiURjtvsFfK11EK47XvumejDowcjPntDfEhpDSy3mTmiJYVsg	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	The only time I think it is good to eliminate comments, is if the target is harmed psychologically by it. But I do think it could be policed in some way to offset this.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	Surely it is possible to have a free exchange of ideas without resorting to hate speech. There must be a level of basic human respect that can be maintained.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	Have monitoring software be used. The comment section should not be removed, because it then deprives the general public of their opinion and freedom of speech as well as addressing any inaccuracies that were mentioned in articles.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	I feel that all users should provide true identification that can be used if they use hate speech to find them/report them.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	A moderated comments section can solve this problem. Freedom of speech does not need to include hate speech. An opinion can be given that doesn't include hate speech in it.
__label__noRel	I agree that many people have different platforms to air their opinions these days, in fact it is very easy to create fake identities, and posts.	People tend to comment just to rile others up, which means it will be a lot of work to moderate. Perhaps an all or nothing approach is best.
__label__noRel	It will be difficult finding people who will remain unbiased on issues they feel strongly about.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	Very funny.	most people seem to be of the opinion that cutting comments altogether is not constructive. A good point was made by an individual that viewing opinions from people you like only doesn't help you to grow (echo chamber).
__label__noRel	It is possible to express opinions without being aggressive, but that doesn't mean people will do so. Online arguments often get very heated and can quickly devolve into hate and personal attacks- this should not be tolerated in forums meant for discussion of news	I think this is a task that is hard to do because it has to be done in a way that would not hinder freedom of speech but at the same time not attack people. Thus, I think comments should be flagged depending on the words used but not be deleted until it has been checked.
__label__noRel	I can agree with this as Newspapers are not government or public services, they are companies trying to sell newspapers and subscriptions to their services for profit, the comments sections are there to bring more revenue into the company and keep more people logged in and using their websites	ithink the best thing to do is to not have comments as that can really alter someone elses perception. Especially in this day and age people tend to rely on comments to then pass their own judgement and that can cause hate speech. However if the comments were to still be present i think an idea would be to mute comments that incite any type of hate.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes.

Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	People constantly find their way around word filters and more often than not it filters a lot of genuine non hate comments too.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way.

__label__noRel	How will a newspaper manage to do this?	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree with this. The trick is how to select unbiased moderators. They have to go by a guideline	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	If such a thing can be created then it could work well	Comment sections are meant for social media platforms. The newspaper can post on a platform such as twitter in order to get comments - while disabling comments on their own platform.
__label__noRel	This may be challenging for newspaper websites with large audiences and therefore a great deal of traffic (which is a likely goal for most/all newspaper companies). The volume of new comments following a breaking story would likely be quite great and the task would very taxing for moderators. If the proportion of content that is hateful is quite high, you may be looking at quite a bit of burnout amongst the moderators who may quickly grow cynical, jaded, and emotionally exhausted from filtering out so much hatred and profanity.	Moderate the comments sections!
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	freedom of speech is essential but hate speech is not. comments should be left on but perhaps there could be a programme which finds key words and eliminates the comment if it seems to be hateful
__label__noRel	save a lot of hate speech being publicized.	the newspapers should have an algorithm that can detect comments which go against the community guidelines and ban these accounts. Spam accounts should also be detected and banned if they do no contribute constructively to the newspapers.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	I disagree with the stance of doing away with the comment section in its entirety, it goes against the premise of media which is to spark a debate or discussion.
__label__noRel	And who would be removing these comments and how do we know that they do not have other motivates behind trying to remove the comment.	Have them reviewed after they are posted and do not allow them to be viewed before they are revied, as well as keeping tabs on the user posting the comments.
__label__noRel	Agreed, there's needs to be stronger consequences for those sharing hate speech. Those behind accounts which troll and leave horrific content should be banned and the ip address blocked.	It is true that it would be difficult to remove and control all of the comments however i think it would be a lot more damaging to remove the right to freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Very appropriate. Hopefully people will interpret this that if they were thinking of posting something bad then keep quiet and don't!	Someone should monitor the chat, and those who use hate speech should be given 1 warning before being removed from the website.
__label__noRel	People should be allowed to express their opinions as long as they are done so respectfully	I think by holding the people that use hateful speech accountable i.e., blocking them from accessing newspaper websites
__label__noRel	when regulating the comments someone will always disagree or challenge the rules. Claim free speech has gone mad etc.	i believe commenting should have it's policy, where users have to read the policy before commenting. So if a user uses language that promotes hate speech, the comment should be removed.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	I think that the website should develop a hate speech filtering software, to remove all offensive words that might be of hate speech.
__label__noRel	true, but maybe they can remove anonymity so that everyone can be accountable for what they say.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	Maybe AI could filter hate speech
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/19/npr-comments-decision-guardian-readers
__label__noRel	An algortithm can provide a cheap and effective solution that is available 24/7 to moderate	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	Having an open platform allows racists to have a forum to vent	We can reduce hate speech by having it moderated
__label__noRel	I agree it really is up to the publisher to include comments. I don't believe that not allowing a platform will reduce hate speech.	I think in order to eliminate hate speech, the comment section itself must be completely eradicated to take a way all potential risk. Newspapers have the sole purpose of giving accurate depictions of current events, there is no responsibility for them to offer social commentary space. One only has to look at the hatred filled comments of the Daily Mail web pages to see the concerning language being used on a regular basis.
__label__noRel	Agree, moderation is the way to go, as hate speech should not be part of any media forums.	Hate speech must be banned totally from the online publications.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	Debate should be available upon all topics. To reduce this availability reduces the opportunities for people to express their opinions and undermines democratic processes. Hate speech should be managed and eliminated before publication.
__label__noRel	https://time.com/5739688/facebook-hate-speech-languages/ This is especially true because not all people speak the language! An algorithm would be best, but there are still some technical issues that we need to address.	Rarely some very sensitive articles should be allowed to switch off comments sector.
__label__noRel	Hate speech is removed	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	People bypass these filters in a large number of ways that are hard to stay ahead of. A simple method for example is replacing an E with a 3 in a word so egg becomes 3gg. It is still pretty clear what is being said and bybasses the system that says I can not use that word for example.	Comment sections need to be well-moderated, and if algoritmic or user comment flagging is used this needs to also be reviewed by a human moderator to ensure that there is no bias or bad faith reporting going on.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	But will that be effective?	hate speech revolves around certain words or slurs so if those word can be banned or even not allowed and the comment does not show up on the actual site it will help curb hate speech
__label__noRel	I find it very helpful when the comments includes updates or links to a more current news story	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	I agree with this argument. It is important to balance the right to freedom of speech against the need to reduce hate speech.	Have moderators who constantly monitor and remove hateful posts or ones that are inciting others/goading others.
__label__noRel	What are the root causes?	As I saw some commentary on this platform, my opinion is that we need 2 things.

__label__noRel	i don't agree with this - you should be able to give an opinion if it is valid and relevant.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	This article made me reflect on the definition of hate speech and I aggree with blocking comments that go against a persons protected characteristics - if a comment like that is made, it should instantly be banned from the platform / comment section. https://about.fb.com/news/2017/06/hard-questions-hate-speech/
__label__noRel	Efficient, less controversial	by blocking users who violate 'hate speech rules', i feel it should be clearly stated what hate speech is.
__label__noRel	I feel that people should be protected	You should be allowed to give your opinion to express your view about a news article. To moderate this or to filter what you can and cannot say would it stop it from being free speech. What really needs to be looked at is to see how you can stop online trolling which I think is the root cause of some of these comment sections become so toxic. But for the media who is so depended on free speech themselves so that they can report on news in an unbiased way to eliminate the comment space is almost hypocritical. Just a weird idea here but perhaps you should do a quick test or verification before you can comment. A lot of people would not go through the effort of completing this if they just want to spread hate.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Newspaper websites should use human or artificial intelligence-based moderators who can impartially identify hate speech and remove it from their platforms without removing or censoring genuine, constructive comments and perspectives. If AI is used, certain terms and phrases can be added to a database and comments containing them flagged for moderation to remove hate speech fairly.
__label__noRel	The right to free speech doesn't mean there should be no consequences for hate speech.	This should be a priority, some hate speech is not necessary
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	Removing the comment section all together is a fair point as news is meant to be fair and impartial. People share their opinions based on their biases and that's not what the news is for - that's what social media is for. But in this case allowing the comment section to remain would be great if people would not abuse the power to share freely by sharing hate speech and slander. us as humans need to be regulated by a set of rules in order to keep a functioning society and i think a filtered comment section is the solution.
__label__noRel	Reduced number of readers because of the cost of purchase.	I dont think it is a fair choice. For how long should people be silenced. Hate speech is always going to be around. Shutting people up is not going to stop hate speech.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	I think one way to reduce hate speech online would be monitoring the message. If someone writes a message, it should be checked before allowing it to be posted, it could be done by a simple program where the computer looks for offensive words.
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	By having stricter controls over who can sign up to the comments and blocking them from the sites when they use hate speech. It's unfortunate that it happens, but sometimes they are loud just to get attention. Starve them of it.
__label__noRel	Some opinions may be trigger ing to others	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	The comments could be examined for offensive language. For instance, there might be a robot that scans comments for offensive language and deletes them.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Some people just like to spread their negative vibes on strangers, not worried about serious consequences, as the worst thing that can happen to them is the comment being removed. There should be consequences!
__label__noRel	Opinions shouldn't be classed as "hate speech". If some people (snowflakes) get triggered by different points of view they should refrain from reading the comments section rather than whine about "hate speech".	Hate speech is a form of self publicity. If the community isolates the perpetrators by flagging negative content that would be helpful. Flagged content would then need to be followed by banning perpetrators
__label__noRel	I agree and I think because there are so many people with so many different opinions, it should be censored before it is either posted or passed through the section.	I disagree. Comments might be useful for users and also the owners of the newspapers. Though, asking people to identify themselves when registering could help reduce hate speech, as people would not be able to do whatever they want anonymously.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	Censoring speech prevents progress as a soceity. (https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2016/04/free-speech-important/)
__label__noRel	anyone could have a problem with another persons point of view	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	Speech cannot be violence in and of itself. What you are suggesting closes down public forums and debate, enhancing the impact of closed minded thinking and echo chambers in our society.	Asking for their constructive criticism and how it will benefit the individual and community.
__label__noRel	I appreciate that everyone has the right to freedom of speech but at the expense of others and being hateful?	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	Less people sign up for account	We could introduce a system online where it automatically filters out bad language or hate speech by using key words.
__label__noRel	But humans are humans and some abuse these priveleges by posting what they like without considering the consequences.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	I don't think we can police websites 100% but if comments are moderated I think we can reach quite a high degree of compliance
__label__noRel	https://www.salon.com/2018/11/17/why-comments-sections-must-die/ While this article seems to agree with this point of view, I still feel that taking away spaces for discussion isn't the way to control hate speech.	Although it would be fair to allow for both critical and positive input, I believe that newspaper websites should have a mechanism in place that can identify hate speech and restrict individuals who use it. This would prevent readers from freely using hate speech.
__label__noRel	its hard to find moderators without bias	there needs to be some form of ceneorship of what newspaper can post i dont mean full censorship i just mean around things realating to hate of certain group
__label__noRel	Will still allow some comments which could be seen as offensive	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	Despite our general right to freedom of speech, hate speech remains inextricably linked to hate crimes and intolerance. A hard stance should be taken by newspapers against hate speech, utilising moderators to remove hateful comments, despite the fact that it could be construed as a restriction on free speech.
__label__noRel	True, but not every criticism is valid	comments should be allowed on newspaper articles so that people can have a discussion and express their opinions, regulation would ultimately ensure that everything is kept in order.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	HATE SPEECH is speech that is vulgar and intended to offend.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	IT is absoluety the websites job to police polirising comments if nesccearry to keep peace wihthin the outiside community viewing their newspapers.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	Thats why its best to have set rules. Like swear language, certain words, threats and stuff like that but anything that is just opinion should be allowed no matter if you disagree or don't like what is said.	Moderating comments could be a viable solution. The use of AI could make it easier given that there could be thousands and thousands of comments, too much for human moderator/s to keep track of.
__label__noRel	Surely this would depend on the opinions and ideas of the moderators in some cases unless they followed some standards such as what the UN outline here on hate speech... https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech	I agree with FransescoT online forums can be a wonderful community but hate speech with faceless people can ruin it. If you want to comment there should be some accountability.
__label__noRel	No censoring of opinions	Completely doing away with the comment section would not be beneficial to the readers experience as reading other peoples thoughts is what sets online media apart from offline media. It plays a role in keeping the discussion going. It would be smart to rather monitor comments to ensure hate speech or utterances of a vile nature are greatly reduced through the use of some sort of algorithm that picks up on problematic words and deletes comments or it being done manually by people who will moderate the comment section.
__label__noRel	does take a lot of work/ man power or bots which could over filter comment sections	We need to create a society where we can debate with each other respectfully, we can know which platforms to use and not rile each other up without offending. It is widely suggested that education can address the extent of hate speech: https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/addressing-hate-speech-through-education-global-education-ministers-conference. However, this needs to go hand in hand with moderation of sites to ensure people are kept within reason. It is not a case of any one single solution.
__label__noRel	https://www.positivemessengers.net/en/news-en/253-how-to-end-hate-speech-some-good-ideas-that-actually-work.html	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	What is characterised as hate speech needs to be assessed on a case by case basis. It is not absolute
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	The question is? Is hate speech not part of free speech? I think people should be left to express themselves however they feel is appropriate as long as they are not breaking an laws
__label__noRel	In my opinion freedom of speech stops when it is directed hate towards a person or a group of people. Online platforms do not have to tolerate hate speech on their platforms.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	This will help the newspaper and community to know which areas affect people the most and help them	It goes further than this. We live in a society that has a lot of cry babies. We need to be impervious to negative comments from strangers on a social platform and that is anonymous. Most people need to grow a pair, develop a spine or stop being cry babies. Once this is achieved you will see that any contribution you make to a discussion will be debated in a civilized manner.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	everyone has the right to share their opinions, however online comments make it too easy for hate and discrimination to be spread with out consequences. There needs to be a way to stop the hate spreading but also still give people the oppertunity to express their comments so i think this is a good idea	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	This is a horribly uninformed and unnecessarily inflammatory opinion, EmilyN. Are you saying that people who want to target, insult, and threaten others should be more protected that the people who are being threatened (i.e. the victims)? Just food for thought.	It is true that it would be difficult to remove and control all of the comments however i think it would be a lot more damaging to remove the right to freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	There is no need to reduce hate speech, we just need to accept it. Banning or reducing hate speech is just censorship which is not acceptable.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	it allows disagreement while preventing abuse	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	depression and peer pressure should really call out to ones morals and values as a human being.	However there is the potential to much greater exposure to it on online than in past times. Therefore I continue to believe that greater controls on those posting comments will decrease mindless hate speech and promote constructive debate.
__label__noRel	This is unlikely to be feasible. United states courts have repeatedly upheld a right to anonymity in this context: https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/why-ending-anonymity-would-not-make-social-media-better.php	https://eachother.org.uk/would-removing-social-media-anonymity-protect-or-threaten-our-rights/ Perhaps hate comments could be reduced by removing the ability to post comments anonymously?
__label__noRel	Not all opinions are valid. Some people should keep their hateful opinions to themselves. https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation	I think that someone should be assigned as a moderator who assesses comments before they are posted to ensure they don't contain any offensive information
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	Moderating comments sections is a lot of work to do manually, the individuals tasked with it would burn out in short time trying to manage that effectively while also having to read hateful garbage all day. If there was a system to remove hate speech it needs to be automated with an algorithm that catches certain words, then reviewed manually when someone disagrees with the content removed and it not being against guidelines. We use guidelines for everything including media regulations for accurate reporting or having to retract when information is not accurate. It's no different in the comments section, it doesn't remove free speech it regulates it to create a healthy environment to have a conversation in. Over moderation can have as severe of an effect as under, it has to be a system that takes in common complaints from both sides. Not the hate speech side per say but the sides of people who are pro free flowing conversation and those who want more shielding to avoid extremist echo chambers.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	by having a system or word check that will not allow users to use words that are considered as hate speech
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	yes. good moderators are the key	we could use bots the get triggered when certain words are used. The bot will therefore remove the comment andhold it until it has mannually reviewed by a human. Another option can be to allow the users to report comments from other users and if the reports reach a certain threshold then hold that comment for review.
__label__noRel	I don't agree. This would infringe on free speech. Rather have guidelines and censor any comments that promote hate speech.	I think the best way to reduce hate speech in newspaper websites is to ensure that the site can detect words and phrases that can be considered hate speech, and block them from being posted on the comment section. Also, a moderator to approve each comment section before it becomes publicly accessible is a notion which can be adopted as well.
__label__noRel	I disagree, comment sections allow the public to engage with the news and find people similar to them	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	yes this is the best way to reduce hate speech while still allowing readers to comment their opinion	It is important for people to voice their opions so I do not thik this discussion is fair, however I do agree that comments should be moderated. The readers should also be made aware of the rules that apply to commenting with regards to hateful speech.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Hate speech is an attack, a threat, or prehudice speech.
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	i think minimum news coverage should be given to hate speech and it shouuld be very stictley monitered as well
__label__noRel	Any expression that freely and openly gives a clear point that will not offend or insult anyone is not hate speech	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	Freedom of speech is important - however hate speech is not important to debate
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	Readers should not be given a false assumption on the understandings of others.
__label__noRel	It would have the advantage of searching out offensive words prior to them actually being printed and could be stopped before they are.

This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	Unfortunately, people do seem to struggle with self-censorship, especially when anonymous and hidden behind a keyboard.	I think that hate speech should be reduced through widescale education about the origins, hurts and trauma behind words which are used. By educating people learn how to respect or debate in effective ways without insulting or offending. UNESCO are suggesting that addressing hate speech through education can bring respect for each other.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	In today's world where technology has advanced to such a degree, I'm of the belief that creating parameters that protect individuals from any form of hate speech is very much possible through things such as AI. The removing of commenting sections could be argued as a violation to one's freedom of speech, it also means the views and opinions of the public will be lost which could have detrimental effects.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	One solution to reduce hate speech is by disabling the comment section altogether for most important topics/controversial topics. Yu can actually leave the comment section open for generic topics/non-contoversial topics.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	Moderation of comments would appear to be the most practicle solution	i think minimum news coverage should be given to hate speech and it shouuld be very stictley monitered as well
__label__noRel	This leaves space for people to bully and be toxic without any consequences	I would not eliminate the hate speech right away but rather alarm the user and ask them to refrain from that kind of speech or ask them to elaborate or explain the reasons for the anger. Maybe as a moderator I would try to understand their viewpoint because by removing the speech there will be just more anger and hatred.
__label__noRel	It is not possible for some people to ignore hate speech, and the effects can be extremely harmful - for example: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	AI could end up preventing speech that does not qualify as hate speech.	They could force users to login and even if they chose to post annonymously, it can be flagged for hate speech and they can be banned from using the platform again.
__label__noRel	Eliminating the space for reader comments would be violating free speech, in my opinion it would be much better to have every incident recorded as a Non-crime hate incident'. The government needs to have stricter and clearer laws on what entails hate crime and hate incidents.	I dont think it is a fair choice. For how long should people be silenced. Hate speech is always going to be around. Shutting people up is not going to stop hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree	every comment submitted by readers must be checked internally for hate speech
__label__noRel	there is no hate speech	realistically hate speech cannot be eliminated but preventative measures cane be put in place to minimise its presence
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	people who comment hate speech should be banned
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	I believe hate speech should be moderated and perhaps shadow-banned. That way users who post comments which are marked by the moderators as hate speech would never know they were banned and would not create new accounts or post more hateful comments.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	I think we should just collect personal information. It works in South Korea. People will behave if their are not anonymous. Modertors are important too, but not enough,
__label__noRel	The right to free speech doesn't mean there should be no consequences for hate speech.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I agree	Be more strict when allowing people to create profiles, that require identification before allowing anybody to comment. Stopping people being anonymous enough to feel confident while posting hate speech I think will be more beneficial than restricting peoples comments.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.

__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	In order for effective moderation to occur, some kind of consensus or clearly reachable policy on what constitutes hate speech (including dogwhistling, which may be less clear to a lay viewer) would need to be in place. This might require too much buy-in from commenters, but is necessary if anything can be consistently enforced.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.

__label__noRel	Agreed.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	I agree	Newspaper should avoid subscription from people who use hate speech

__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.

__label__noRel	I agree, that feels like a reasonable approach. Although I'm a little bit skeptical what comes to its effectivity.	We can have a system where every comment has to be checked and vetted for hate speech and if it infringes on any of the platform's rules and regulations then the comment is automatically removed.
__label__noRel	maybe get something to control what comes in and goes out	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	I think this is a great idea and would certainly help the situation if sone correctly.	we can do that by having strict rules on language and hate speech where one can be blocked from commenting or their comments gets removed if there is any negativity

Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__noRel	It can mean different things to different people, but there are also laws referring to hate speech which define it, albeit not always very clearly	Freedom of speech allows others to express their opinions so we can have an open debate in the hopes of coming to some common agreement about polarising topics. https://youtu.be/WtftZPL-k7Y
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	This is an interesting point - I wonder if some websites already use AI to moderate user comments and posts. I think AI could be trained to recognise hate speech, although it would have to be tested first as it could censor too much.
__label__noRel	Algorithums	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	Agreed	Hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by educating people about the consequences of hate speech and what they can do to someone else.
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	I don't think newspapers, who have already seen their takings plummet in recent years due to everything moving online, will want to pay to employ moderators for their articles. They would need to have a pretty high number of mods in order to keep up as each newspaper carries so many articles. This topic is a massive minefield and I don't think there is a simple solution to it.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	I agree	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	This is frequently used in social media platforms now, but it can be quite time consuming. Also the tone of a statement can be misinterpreting in text format.	My position as a reader and my argument is that bases on the rules of speech people have freedom of speech and expression. That should be done in a proper way without insulting others or hating or being racist in your speech. Websites and newspapers should not remove the comments of the people responding to hate speech. This is done according to the rules found in the following article: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	In a survey of news sites it was found that on average 11% of comments are removed...some of these are because they are spam and some because they are offensive. I think that the fact that it's more than one in two really shows how necessary moderation is, these issues are so common. Source: https://netino.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/WAN-IFRA_Online_Commenting.pdf (pg 7)
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	I think the best way to reduce hate speech in newspaper websites is to ensure that the site can detect words and phrases that can be considered hate speech, and block them from being posted on the comment section. Also, a moderator to approve each comment section before it becomes publicly accessible is a notion which can be adopted as well.
__label__noRel	readers should be able to have their say	I think we have to use some fact checking system that allows us to present thoughts and opinions, the system can block derogatory comments. This allows for a calm debate
__label__noRel	Sometimes people do need to be censored, especially when it comes to hate speech because sometimes those words become actions and people get assaulted in real life. Words spoken online sometimes rally people together to take action (for example what happened in the United States when people stormed the Capitol because of fake news spreading online about the voting results being fraudulent https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/06/election-misinformation-helped-fuel-jan-6-capitol-attack-now-climate-misinformation-threatens-planet/ )	Is space for readers comment really that necessary? Nowadays, with all other social medias available, the conversation can happen on platform made for dialogue. But as practice shows, those "conversations" are often very polarized and everyone is kind of screaming in a void.
__label__noRel	Hate speech is complex and jubjective. AI is still developing and not good enough to understand basic debate let alone interpret language, Too easy for AI to take words out of context.	There should be repercussions to extensive hate speech e.g a limited ban to the forum etc. Use moderators and ensure that users understand the consequences of hate speech commente
__label__noRel	True, but not every criticism is valid	There is no discussion on free speech to have : free speech is absolute or not. If you don't like free speech then go live in China.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	The newspapers should encourage the victims of hate speech to report hate speech published, establish monitoring and evaluation units in newsrooms. Some units should be tasked with monitoring hate speech trends, compiling reports and bringing these to the attention of key institutions
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	But what about those who were going to give positive comments. I believe comments should just be monitored
__label__noRel	writers will not know how the reader feels	Have monitoring software be used. The comment section should not be removed, because it then deprives the general public of their opinion and freedom of speech as well as addressing any inaccuracies that were mentioned in articles.
__label__noRel	Freedom of speech	I think removing space for comments is not the solution because how else will people discuss the matter at hand or share their opinion. I think hate speech should be set to be hidden from being viewed instread.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	Focus on neural subjects, but in reality hate speech is just a part of life
__label__noRel	Definitely polarised but can't imagine it ending well. You'll just turn it into a hate echo chamber.	Removing the comment section from online newspapers is not the answer. Allowing people to post their opinions is healthy and a normal part of human society- people will not always agree. However, in order to reduce hate speech, which can so often lead to crime, it could be done so that there are monitors (either human or computer) who check comments before they are posted to ensure they are not hate speech.
__label__noRel	Without the use of id and controls to set up acounts, people once banned will just create new accounts.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	This is a win or loose situation. People will still continue with their comments even if it is not on the newspapers website. A person can take a screenshot of the topic and then twit it on twitter and then people will give their different opinions. The newspaper can still allow for readers comment however, the hate speech comments can be filtered. This is a democratic world and people have a right to have an opinion in what becomes available to them
__label__noRel	The problem with AI is that it lacks morality, thus it can be exploited for other and selfish reasons.	Where is the evidence for this? There is no guarantee that people will give correct credentials. Also, who defines 'hate speech'? This is not as simple as you may believe.
__label__noRel	Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but opinions that are built around criticism of ones work do not benefit an ybody	I think everyone raised some good points already, but overall, it seems to be that some moderation is required no matter what, and that might be too costly for some smaller platforms to implement.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	I think using a platform which blocks out certain words, kind of like a filter would help. So if someone made a post with a certain word in, that post would not be made public, instead the comment would be flagged and go to a admin, who can read the comment and then decide if the 'bot' which flagged it was correct or not, and then deciding if to allow the post to be made or not
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	I think that the idea of users submitting personal data before making a comment can have positive and negative effects - positive in the sense that the user may think twice before posting hate speech and that they can be tracked down and educated; negative in the sense that the user could be on a website that wants to use user's personal data for the wrong reasons. I am still of the view that comments with hate speech need to be filtered out because each individual needs to be responsible in their speech.

I would disagree because newspaper share societal information and society should be allowed to engage and be part of the conversation instead of just consuming whatever information is being released for consumption. It has been seen as a result of other newspaper websites removing the comment section that it reduces the trust of the reader because they are aware of the bias of the information they are consuming, and also it reduces the amount of time readers spend on these sites because there is no community engagements.

__label__noRel	I disagree. Removing the comments section is limiting access to echo chambers, quite literally.	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__noRel	Automatically hiding comments flagged inappropriate may promote hate speech as well, as coordinated groups may flag comments to target and suppress the speech of specific people.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	But what about those who were going to give positive comments. I believe comments should just be monitored
__label__noRel	true	I think the best way is to block or censor certain words. Especially words that are synonymous with hate speech. Or better yet, have moderators in comments sections.
__label__noRel	Great	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	This makes a good point. I think people should have freedome of speech but I also do think websites need to monitor comments.	We need very close moderation as this in all likelihood is the best way to ensure hate speech does not spread, human interaction is key as algorithms do not do a very good job
__label__noRel	Even with human moderators it still comes down to personal preference. There is no person alive who doesn't have ANY biases. what one human moderator might deem acceptable language another might not. Therefore, even human moderation isn't 100% accurate and failsafe.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	I think they hold some responsibility. But perhaps not in the way this survey is trying to determine. A free flow of ideas is necessary, which includes difficult and often cantankerous and vigorous differing opinions. It should be the responsibility of said sites to allow those types of opinions, but deal with the trolls that free and open debate often attract.	Make readers agree to not sharing hate speech and let them know that if they do, they will be blocked from commenting.
__label__noRel	We shouldn't have to see it regardless.	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	i agree with this as it will be moderated then	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.

__label__noRel	I don't agree with arguments that removing comment sections is an attack on free speech. People have multiple platforms where they can give their opinions (social media, emails, forums, conversations etc.). Newspapers aren't required to provide yet another place for people to converse.	I agree with the notion that being able to share our thoughts and feelings is a right and having people share their views can help people to question their own thoughts.

__label__noRel	I agree	Many people are against the reducing of hate speech from newspaper article, and I am with them on this. The main reason for putting comment section on newspaper websites was for readers to leave a comment, people will always have something to say whether it is good or bad.

Thus freedom of speech should be no different. Poeple need to be held accountable for their mistakes, so everybody else's rights will be protected. So having a set of keywords which are not allowed to be used is a way of reminding the writter that using the offensive word he/she is trying to use is considered a crime. An additional way to handle that is having the flag option by users and a team of moderators who follow a standard and will verify if flagged comments should be maintained or not. Lastly, anonymity might bring a feeling of impunity and even its possibility, so a way to avoid that is allowing one profile per person/email, where a fake username can be set, but, in the backstage, the website will know who it is that wrote each comment.

__label__noRel	The hate speech will go underground and may appear in other closed forums or whatsapp groups.	Maybe filter through comments
__label__noRel	setting a team aside to check for hate speech is the solution and removing it	In as much as we can not let the spread of hate speech continue, closing the comment section is not the solution. The newspaper website should have the option for readers to be able to report comments that include hate speech and moderators should be appointed to check "users" that are violating the rules. There can be filters in place that remove posts that have some of the common hateful and derogatory phrases. outlining the rules and regulations for the website users can help
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	educate young people on online politeness for want of a better word word have meaning and consequences in the real world and individuals have to take responsibility and not hide behind keyboards
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	Nice. Your comment sums it up. Comments should be allowed to enable freedom of speech but vetted to prevent hate speeches that can invite violence amomgs the citizens
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	There is no cure for hate speech, but there is a way to stand up against it. Speak out against hate speech - fight racism and bigotry with love, empathy, compassion, and strength. We may not be able to eliminate hatred entirely, but the more steps we can take to educate and support human beings, and speak out against injustice, the better this world will become. Resources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech
__label__noRel	At the same time, this seems like it would have such potential for corruption - who programmes the software? Newspaper sites could simple auto-remove any comments that disagree with them.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	Hate speech is something is completely unacceptable and should be eradicated by all means necessary however regulations are our best bet if we are to maintain freedom of speech at the same time.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	i agree that people have the right to express their own ideas but you have to be considerate otherwise it can easily be interpreted as hate if your not careful with wordings.

__label__noRel	This is an interesting point of view and I certainly believe that reducing the level of anonymity may help to moderate opinions.	We live in a democratic society and so people have the right to their opinions. They just need to be voiced in the right way
__label__noRel	I agree. Children should be taught in schools the value to expressing their opinions but also the difference in expressing and opinion and spreading hate.

__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	The idea that media should be able to stop a conversation is wrong and this is what would happen if comments were removed.
__label__noRel	I agree!	I think it is important for people to be able to comment on newspapers websites, but I think there needs to be a way of moderating the comments section to prevent/remove hate speech.
__label__noRel	can help educate	This should be a priority, some hate speech is not necessary
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Online comment spaces should be platforms promoting free speech, with some restrictions in place. Human or digital moderators (AI) could be used to identify comments and phrases constituting hate speech and remove them from the platform without hindering people's ability to share their authentic views.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	I found this really interesting, "Khan said the freedom of opinion and expression, including the right to seek, receive and disseminate diverse sources of information, must be upheld by States in times of crises and armed conflict as a precious ‘survival right’ on which people’s lives, health, safety, security and dignity depend." This is similar to what lots of people have been saying regarding worrying that this sort of censorhip could overextend. (https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/10/protect-freedom-expression-vital-survival-right-civilians-armed-conflict-un)
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	There should be a warning to ban the account of someone who uses hate words in the comment section.	https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-63291527

__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	With rights comes responsibility. We all have freedom of speech but it is our responsibility to ensure that our speech does not cause harm on others. If people do not want to be responsible in their speech, then their speech should be reduced because things have consequences. So, the hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by removing comments with hate speech or having a software that can identify hate speech in a comment before it is posted.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	The most surprising position was to completely eliminate the comments section. various studies have been conducted in this regard and they all agree on one thing and that deleting comments is not a good idea and can damage the general perception of the outlet. https://mediaengagement.org/research/how-the-public-views-deletion-of-offensive-comments/
__label__noRel	Yes, and also also others to report. If many report, the moderators will take a closer look.	We can have a system where every comment has to be checked and vetted for hate speech and if it infringes on any of the platform's rules and regulations then the comment is automatically removed.
__label__noRel	Sometimes being truthful can mean being harsh, but for the greater good.	To ensure freedom of speech is still maintained, moderation needs to be carried out fairly. To achieve this, we need to understand what is hate speech and what are the lines that seperate that with constructive criticism. Attached is an article by the Standford encyclopedia of physiosphy regarding hate speech. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hate-speech/
__label__noRel	I don't think algorithm can accurately detect hate speech.	I agree with some other opinions on the use of A1 to flag or censor certain words that constitute hate or violent speech. It would also be beneficial to have a human supervisor from the organisation and another external body review the activities of the AI to ensure accuracy and consistency.
__label__noRel	But a negative comment is not bad especially if what was done deserves to reprimanded.	More emphasis on moderation of specific language would reduce the risk of hate speech. Also, moderators approving comments before they appear on the website would help.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?

__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	In addition to reducing hate speech by site moderation community moderation could also take place having the ability to flag a post for the attention of moderators which violates terms of service.
__label__noRel	I agree with Ian. It has real life consequences. It is important that moderators can identify hate speech, that is not free speech.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	there would be no hate speech	There is a careful balance to be made between protecting others from the effects of hate speech and protecting free speech. Online hate speech unfortunately can have the effect of increasing violence against minorities (https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons) but blocking all free speech because of the actions of a few seems like a poor decision. More must be done to remove hate speech online quickly and this means spending more money tackling it.
__label__noRel	reflecting on this, and the use of AI - here is a statement from Facebook about monitoring hate speech and now allowing these comments on the platform: https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/policies/community-standards/hate-speech/	Yes there must be a a strong policy for reviewal before publishing.
__label__noRel	The main question is how to determine what is considered as discrimination or violence. Opposing arguments can be flagged as discrimination or violense.	State that the editor is free to print or not print any comments, and his/hers is the final decision.
__label__noRel	Asking people to ignore it is not a solution	We need to be very clear about what constitutes hate speech and create severe punishments for those that spread it.
__label__noRel	the mods could be outweighed due to the content volume	What is characterised as hate speech needs to be assessed on a case by case basis. It is not absolute
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	People should be members with addresses checked
__label__noRel	I agree, everyone has freedom of speech but no should abuse it and use it using hate speech. Everybody should respect everyone's idea/opinion.	There needs to be a level of moderation before comments are posted. Comments that are harmful, false or misleading shouldn't be allowed to be put up, but there should still be room for healthy debate.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	We do have to allow people to express their opinions - we can't pretend opinions don't exist. Having them out in the open lets us know what we're dealing with. But at the same time hate speech can't be allowed to flourish and absolutely needs to be challenged. There is a role for AI (which I have said before I know) to try and weed out and remove anything that is just pure hate and not any sort of coherent argument or opinion.
__label__noRel	Shows an active moderation panel.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	i agree that moderators have their uses but then unless they are trained properly their biases may creep in
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	They could force users to login and even if they chose to post annonymously, it can be flagged for hate speech and they can be banned from using the platform again.
__label__noRel	I think this is good and supports freedom of speech, but at the same time, we cant really control "aggressiveness" in people especially considering that the degreees of acceptable aggressiveness varies with each person	comment sections should not be removed as that will prevent those with positive comments form sharing their thoughts, they should instead be reviewed regulary so that hate speech is flagged and removed another solution is for comments to be approved by moderators before they go public
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Moderation of the comments section
__label__noRel	Good idea as this may deter many who are considering posting hateful comments, although it may not deter the die-hards.	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	Yes, another way to only limit hate speech is to remove anonymity. Therefore, certain sites can require those to sign-up with their bio and this is verified by moderators. Someone may think twice about being 'hateful' if there are repercussions.	An article proving AI can be helpful, but can struggle to interpret or detect certain things, suggesting manual reviewing is still very important. https://www.latrobe.edu.au/nest/can-combat-rise-online-hate-speech/ On another note, I also think anonymity plays a huge role in what people allow themselves to post online and think that certain platforms should consider only allowing people to comment under their own identity rather than online handles and such.
__label__noRel	Too many people might find it offensive and may be sensitive to the article and therefore take 'opinions' more personally.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	Debate is important	I'm a firm believer of freedom of speech therefore eliminating it in any form especially because of something that can be regulated like hate speech, to me is ridiculous.
__label__noRel	I think that would be a good thing as there isn't really a way to predict how someone will react to specific words or general ideas used against them	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	Less people will be willing to pay.	There could be a segment in the website that gives informed context to a subject to prevent uninformed comments and furthermore the newspaper should monitor the comments and censor any hate speech comments.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Ideally comment section should not be available on newspaper to reduce hate speech
__label__noRel	Social media companies are already using AI to do this and news platform should approach it in the same way - https://www.newsy.com/stories/artificial-intelligence-is-used-to-track-down-hate-speech/	Newspaper websites can have an option where other people could report the hate speech comment.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	We need to create a society where we can debate with each other respectfully, we can know which platforms to use and not rile each other up without offending. It is widely suggested that education can address the extent of hate speech: https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/addressing-hate-speech-through-education-global-education-ministers-conference. However, this needs to go hand in hand with moderation of sites to ensure people are kept within reason. It is not a case of any one single solution.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Newspapers and free speech functioned well for a couple of hundred years without instant comments. People used to write letters to the newspaper, including their name. The newspaper would then publish some letters anonymously. This meant that people were protected but offered well considered opinions, rather than abusive or nasty comments. Perhaps a slower postal system encourages better behaviour rather than an amplified Twitter-esque school-yard of bullying and abuse.
__label__noRel	not focusing on the interconnection between free speech and hate crime	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	making individuals aware	You should be allowed to give your opinion to express your view about a news article. To moderate this or to filter what you can and cannot say would it stop it from being free speech. What really needs to be looked at is to see how you can stop online trolling which I think is the root cause of some of these comment sections become so toxic. But for the media who is so depended on free speech themselves so that they can report on news in an unbiased way to eliminate the comment space is almost hypocritical. Just a weird idea here but perhaps you should do a quick test or verification before you can comment. A lot of people would not go through the effort of completing this if they just want to spread hate.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	One user by the name of AndreaP said in order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section Newspapers should be one sided providers. I strongly disagree with this argument. It is very autocratic and happens a lot in countries where media and citizens does not have freedom and oppressed by harsh leadership. Comments in newspapers help many to get raw information from the ground and open minds of many to see issues differently from differing opinions. Indeed comments section are necessary
__label__noRel	Moderators need to act quickly to remove any hate speech	Despite my defence of human moderators, it seems they too are flawed -- check out this article https://www.technologynetworks.com/informatics/news/ai-trusted-as-much-as-humans-to-flag-hate-speech-365777 -- human moderators are not only prone to bias but also impractical. With the huge wealth of content posted every second online, it is unrealistic to expect humans to be able to view, criticise, and moderate every single comment.

__label__noRel	someone that works for the newspapers or websites?	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I don't think blocking key words that in the majority could only be expressed in a hateful way would give them unilateral power. it is possible to do this under instagram posts and I dont think the majority of people would even notice	The only way to combat hate speech is through open debate. Restricting any form of speech (even hate speech) could lead to hateful views becoming unchallenged and potentially result in violence. There is also the issue that newspapers could define hate speech as certain comments they don't like destroying any potential for open debate. By maintaining open debate hate speech can be called out and as a result, become less frequent.
__label__noRel	There are few forums for public discourse outside actual politics.	Everyone is entitled to freedom of speech but hate speech can be detrimental to readers and the topics mental health.

__label__noRel	When moderators have to approve all comments before they get posted you might create an environment where comments the moderator does not agree with do not get posted at all.

__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way.

There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	I think that the idea of users submitting personal data before making a comment can have positive and negative effects - positive in the sense that the user may think twice before posting hate speech and that they can be tracked down and educated; negative in the sense that the user could be on a website that wants to use user's personal data for the wrong reasons. I am still of the view that comments with hate speech need to be filtered out because each individual needs to be responsible in their speech.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	By flagging certain vocabulary which relates to hate speech and once this is flogged, the person commenting is blocked from posting their view. We would need to look at ways of getting around mispellings of the words though, as people could use this to get past the AI.
__label__noRel	Hate speech is a nonsense concept.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	This would be a lazy attempt to reduce hate speech as it doesn't allow for people to make genuine, thoughtful expressions of opinion that is useful for others to read.	I don't think newspapers, who have already seen their takings plummet in recent years due to everything moving online, will want to pay to employ moderators for their articles. They would need to have a pretty high number of mods in order to keep up as each newspaper carries so many articles. This topic is a massive minefield and I don't think there is a simple solution to it.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	Its ok to have some negative comments as long as they are balanced and not offensive or personal	Algorithms are a must to cut out hate speech. Allowing only paying subscribers is elitist but necessary as being traceable is important.
__label__noRel	Sometimes people do need to be censored, especially when it comes to hate speech because sometimes those words become actions and people get assaulted in real life. Words spoken online sometimes rally people together to take action (for example what happened in the United States when people stormed the Capitol because of fake news spreading online about the voting results being fraudulent https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/06/election-misinformation-helped-fuel-jan-6-capitol-attack-now-climate-misinformation-threatens-planet/ )	Reduce the anonymity that hate-speech writers can hide behind - without that shield some may be less inclined to post because it can be traced back to them
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it.

I kind of agree, but I think that organisations have a responsibility to put something in place to monitor their comment sections. Even if it's not an algorithm and it's an actual person instead!

__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	The use of admins and moderators can be helpful in removing hate speech.

__label__noRel	I think moderation is better than asking for a lot of personal data.	No-one should have to spend their time filtering out the disgusting things human beings are capable of saying about each other. Nobody has a right to comment on anything.

__label__noRel	I agree with this statement.	Hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by educating people about the consequences of hate speech and what they can do to someone else.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	There needs to be a moderator who is reviewing the comments that are made, I see a lot of inappropriate comments posted to news stories on the comments section of the news articles on facebook that incite arguments and hate speech. This is not acceptable and should not be allowed to happen.
__label__noRel	And we will get to keep our respectful viewers who knows that you still have disagreement without insulting others	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	I also agree with this position. letting people fully express themselves will fully enable sourcing The root of the problem	I don't think we can police websites 100% but if comments are moderated I think we can reach quite a high degree of compliance
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	I think we need to develop a way to recognize hate speech in comments so that it is easy to monitor comment sections for derogatory and offensive language. There are studies on how to go about this for example if you follow this link it talks about "A Feature-Based Approach to Assess Hate Speech in User Comments" https://www.cairn.info/revue-questions-de-communication-2020-2-page-529.htm
__label__noRel	I agree, there are currently no online hate speech statistics available due to a lack of means to report hate speech: https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/what-is-online-hate-crime/	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	Develop AI which is able to detect and delete hate speech automatically.
__label__noRel	The fact we are discussing it with different responses is evidence of your point that it is a very difficult question to find a solution to.	we could filter the comments and have a panel to decide
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	By having an algorithm that detects and deletes any hate speech comment.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	Allow others users to rate the comments and block those who receive bad ratings
__label__noRel	You are right -People have lost the ability to debate, and think that shouting the loudest wins the argument.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	IT is absoluety the websites job to police polirising comments if nesccearry to keep peace wihthin the outiside community viewing their newspapers.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I like the idea of 'repeat offenders' being noticed if you will. It means people can't abuse the system as easily	Before an opinion is published it must be moderated and if it contains hate speech then the writer will not be able to post it.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	To add to my previous comment about having clear and established rules I refer to https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/article-1388145/House-Rules.html The daily mail is well known for having a very open and sometimes contentious comment section. By having clear rules and removing posts that break rules and not based on opinion or thought. You can allow people to say controversial things as long as they stay within some boundaries	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	I have read through some of the cooments and my stance is still the same. It is no doubt that hate speech is a problem, however, not allowing the public the opportunity to comment on issues may not only be a problem against freedom of speech, it may also cause the newspaper to lose some of its loyal readers if they're not able to engage with the content shared by the newspaper.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	I believe removing the comment section is not a solution and that it actually encourages hate speech
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	the best way to address hate speech to make it clear to the viewers regarding the consequence of hate speech. Also, only individuals who have registered on the platform after providing their details can be allowed to comment. furthermore, new accounts must be placed on a probation period and cannot be allowed to comment on the same day that they are created.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites may remove comment areas if they wish. Having moderators or allowing only subscribed comments are also options that may work. They just have to be careful on who decides what is hate speech and what is fair comment.	People can express them selves however they like but they must be mindful to their language.
__label__noRel	I think that once you go down the route of cancelling comments, you run the risk of an almost dictatorship position for the newspapers, to be able to say what they like with no comeback from anyone.	I think with careful moderation, there's nothing wrong with keeping the comments section. Reddit is a fine example of extremely good moderation combined with bots that immediately remove content with insults and hatespeech.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	I think there should be moderators on articles that make the comments. less visible so offensive comments can have a warning before viewing
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	Nice. Your comment sums it up. Comments should be allowed to enable freedom of speech but vetted to prevent hate speeches that can invite violence amomgs the citizens
__label__noRel	Agreed, this article shares the same views. Its should not be the Newspaper taking accountability	However there is the potential to much greater exposure to it on online than in past times. Therefore I continue to believe that greater controls on those posting comments will decrease mindless hate speech and promote constructive debate.
__label__noRel	Being open to the voice of the opposition means that we can hear another side of the argument	There is a careful balance to be made between protecting others from the effects of hate speech and protecting free speech. Online hate speech unfortunately can have the effect of increasing violence against minorities (https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons) but blocking all free speech because of the actions of a few seems like a poor decision. More must be done to remove hate speech online quickly and this means spending more money tackling it.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	This should prevent such comments from being printed, but I think any attempt to 'educate' such persons is totally futile. They are hard-wired to hold that point of view, often drilled into them by parents/caregivers.	This should be done with a mix of moderation, community flagging and reporting before moving to disabling comments, based ona mix of moderative judgement and amount of flagging
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	i think by just censoring specific words that are hateful/derogatory this could then automically screen out hateful comments that are abusive - i think it should be judged on what would be an offense to say in person. This could then use humans to read and monitor comment boards and then train AI to further do so
__label__noRel	Genuine hate speech will be ignored with that view	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	It is the best solution	The website must have words that are automatically marked as unacceptable. whenever those words are included in a comment, the website must privately warn the sender and not allow the comment to go through until the comment is rephrased correctly and politely.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	A moderated comments section can solve this problem. Freedom of speech does not need to include hate speech. An opinion can be given that doesn't include hate speech in it.
__label__noRel	Hate speech is very different to valid criticism.	It goes further than this. We live in a society that has a lot of cry babies. We need to be impervious to negative comments from strangers on a social platform and that is anonymous. Most people need to grow a pair, develop a spine or stop being cry babies. Once this is achieved you will see that any contribution you make to a discussion will be debated in a civilized manner.
__label__noRel	Freedom of speech	Proper moderation that does not tolerate racist, sexist or any other discriminating behavior or hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	I think by holding the people that use hateful speech accountable i.e., blocking them from accessing newspaper websites
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	I suppose the problem here is what a person says is their version of "free speech" could easily be seen in a different context by a reader. It's a very difficult issue to get right.	This should be a priority, some hate speech is not necessary
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	Hate-speech is part of free-speech, it's hard to focus on one without affecting the other so what should be done is to write articles differently, a neutral way where both sides can see themselves because we become less aggressive when we feel part of a group
__label__noRel	Its true that the old way we used to read newspapers were without comments so we should just do that now online to stop all the hate speech.	Issues around hate speech bring into clear relief the emergence of private spaces for expression that serve a public function, this may lead to violence or non-radical behaviors for the public at large. The only possible way of reduction is for writers to not write or give out any opinions of hate speech. This will ensure that readers are comfortable.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	This is not just a newspaper comment section problem... it's a social media problem as well, more like an internet problem. We need way to not push people away, but educate them. Because the truth is, nobody starts out as a hater but radicaliz ation can happen to anyone. check https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P55t6eryY3g
__label__noRel	I agree it is an individual's responsiblity to choose their words carefully, and if they don't then their comments, or eventually if they persist, their accounts should be removed.	I believe that people are allowed to express their opinions , that is why we have freedom of speech. However with that right, we are not subjected to hate speech, there are so many ways of expressing yourself without using offensive or hateful words. Considering a newspaper is a public platform, I believe everyone should try to be respective at all times. The comment space must not be removed, it helps to get insights of readers and is very helpful. I think the website should be enhanced in a way that it detects offensive language and doesn't allow the reader to continue if they use such. Also, comments should be monitored before being posted to the public.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	the comment section can actually be a platform for bullying other people and hence it is a solution . removing it will limit publication of the hate speech	Maybe the only solution is to remove the space for comments? We see the same issues on other platforms that allow comments!
__label__noRel	This is a good idea, as it eliminates the need for a moderator to sift through every single comment but rather they only need to look through comments that have triggered the bot. Then, they can make a decision on whether it has truly conveyed hate speech or whether (less likely scenario) there is human/bot error in the process	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	It is definitely the way to go. We should not allow hate speech	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	If journalistss are allowd hteir view and opinion which in many instances can be objecive, public should defientley be allowed to shar theirs, since ournalists are there to promot information and possibly dialogue as well	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I think that would be a good thing as there isn't really a way to predict how someone will react to specific words or general ideas used against them	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	There is a fine line between freedom of speech and hate. And hate can be interpreted differently for different people causing biased censorship. Therefore newspapers should have moderators from both sides of opinion that overlook comments to approve before they are published
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	You can let people create an account with a full name so they will have to think more about what they write and can't so easily spew hate
__label__noRel	Human bias would still be at the very core of this moderation, but then again humans build algorithims too.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__noRel	I believe moderation should occur instead of total removal to allow people. to express their views	hate speech is inevitable
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	With rights comes responsibility. We all have freedom of speech but it is our responsibility to ensure that our speech does not cause harm on others. If people do not want to be responsible in their speech, then their speech should be reduced because things have consequences. So, the hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by removing comments with hate speech or having a software that can identify hate speech in a comment before it is posted.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	Removing the comment section will only create a bigger revolt and uprise from people that write hate speech, and it will move to another media outlets. So the problem should be treated not silenced it. It is the responsibility of newspapers websites to police hate speech in order to create a safe environment for an healthy discussion about a news article. Otherwise you are cutting short an experience that users might want to have. So by censoring all the comment section your make erverybody pay a price for something that they haven't done. Moderation is the key and should be done my the newspapers websites according to the values they have.
__label__noRel	I don't agree with removing the space for views to be aired. That is an important part of challenging and changing opinion. I agree that hate speech should not be tolerated so finding the users and punishing them is key.	Flag up hate comments.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	We should all have the option to voice our opinion. If doing so can result in hate speech, then we have to find a way to fight it instead of trying to eliminate comments altogether. Flagging certain words or using algorithms could potentially could help hide comments that don't add any value and are just trying to cause harm
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	Hate-speech is part of free-speech, it's hard to focus on one without affecting the other so what should be done is to write articles differently, a neutral way where both sides can see themselves because we become less aggressive when we feel part of a group
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Moderating comments sections is a lot of work to do manually, the individuals tasked with it would burn out in short time trying to manage that effectively while also having to read hateful garbage all day. If there was a system to remove hate speech it needs to be automated with an algorithm that catches certain words, then reviewed manually when someone disagrees with the content removed and it not being against guidelines. We use guidelines for everything including media regulations for accurate reporting or having to retract when information is not accurate. It's no different in the comments section, it doesn't remove free speech it regulates it to create a healthy environment to have a conversation in. Over moderation can have as severe of an effect as under, it has to be a system that takes in common complaints from both sides. Not the hate speech side per say but the sides of people who are pro free flowing conversation and those who want more shielding to avoid extremist echo chambers.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	Moderation of both users and comments isn't difficult to implement and will weed out the idiots that want to ruin it.
__label__noRel	Yes, I agree 100% with this as the impacts of hate speech and cyberbullying can be detrimental to the person. https://www.youthranch.org/blog/social-media-dangers-and-the-effects-of-cyberbullying	A machine filtering comments would have a positive affect as then people still have the freedom of speech without the vulger and disrespectful language
__label__noRel	Freedom of speech should never be taken away.	The comments could be examined for offensive language. For instance, there might be a robot that scans comments for offensive language and deletes them.
__label__noRel	moderators can remove bad comments	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	The way to fairly reduce hate speech is to use a mix of technology and human intervention to manage the potential volume of moderation required to provide a healthy environment for discussion. There are a number of tools available that allow for pre- and post-moderation to curb the worst excesses of user comments. This can be further enhanced by requiring readers to give a little more data about themselves to reduce the anonymity which provides a cloak for the potentially worst expressions of hatred.
__label__noRel	that is true there are many ways to reduce hate speech from newspapers	I think we firstly have to call out hate speech in order for people to learn that it is not okay and unacceptable. The reason being online 'haters' tend to abuse their right to free speech such that it infringes upon the next person because they have the comfort of knowing that nobody will find put who they really are and confront them. By calling out users on the newspaper website and responding to their comment as the moderator of the comments, and actually suspending their accounts because of it can go a long way.
__label__noRel	I agree. Accountability is extremly important for public confidence, so very important that this happens	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	We should avoid appearing like we are doing cancel culture	I think that the warning system is a good route, as the AI might eliminate valid arguments and miss hate speech accidentally. A warning system would still need an AI, but it warns users that their comment may be hate speech and if it is, the user can rethink their wording or risk posting it. If they post it, maybe a manual review can happen to determine if it was hate speech or not.
__label__noRel	If you eliminate comments completely you both take away the right to free speech and inhibit the ability to have an open discussion about what constitutes hateful and offensive comments	freedom speech is good but it assumes that common sense prevails too
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	By having an administrator who is able to monitor any comment posted, and removing hateful speech and giving warning to hateful viewers
__label__noRel	reduces freedom of speech	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	I agree with Ian. It has real life consequences. It is important that moderators can identify hate speech, that is not free speech.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	when hate speech encourages violence or discrimination against any specific class of people it should be removed regardless of how inoffensive an particular individual might find it	Having a screaning for all comments before they go up on the platform to make sure that they are not posted on the site.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	I agree with most of the commenters here, there needs to be moderation. Even if you don't agree with the arguments there are ways of saying it that do not fall into 'hate speech'.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	Removing the comment facility in no way infringes free speech. The content providers, newspapers, are at liberty to provide discussion space or not as they see fit. The use of a moderator might be useful but this seems a great investment of time to little effect. There are obviously those who enjoy using comment spaces to express extreme and unthought out opinions as well as to insert hate speech. Perhaps only those who have subscribed to a news source should be allowed to comment.
__label__noRel	Yes, you can have your own opinion but that doesnt mean you have the right to spread hate.	Hate speech will always appear on open forums. The problem stems from how to stop this from happening.
__label__noRel	Not if the idea is hateful to minorities.	Hate speech is not a criticsm and should be avoided
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	The most surprising position was to completely eliminate the comments section. various studies have been conducted in this regard and they all agree on one thing and that deleting comments is not a good idea and can damage the general perception of the outlet. https://mediaengagement.org/research/how-the-public-views-deletion-of-offensive-comments/
__label__noRel	We should avoid appearing like we are doing cancel culture	realistically hate speech cannot be eliminated but preventative measures cane be put in place to minimise its presence

__label__noRel	I think the practicalities of providing identity verification could be tricky. For instance, you could have people attempting to pose as others and posting inflammatory statements.	By having technology that can detect hate speech so that it can be blocked before it is posted.
__label__noRel	Great! I have a similar approach	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	people have freedom of speech. which they can reflect upon their actions	checking the comments before allow the user to post it
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	I don't think it's fair to eliminate comments from newspaper articles because the public is entitled to have their opinions heard. The best way to deal with hate speech is to moderate each comment before it is posted. Also the newspaper could ban accounts who engage in hate speech in the comments section. This moderation could be done through both human moderators and software to find trigger words signifying hate speech. It's important to democracy that citizens can have their say on the issues that affect their lives.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	there must be a code of conduct which is publicly accessible to write a comment. comment themselves could have button on where any other person could consider the comment to behateful with a points system in place
__label__noRel	In my opinion freedom of speech stops when it is directed hate towards a person or a group of people. Online platforms do not have to tolerate hate speech on their platforms.	as long as good moderators are in place, hate speech and disrespectful comments will be weeded out.
__label__noRel	everyone has the right to share their opinions, however online comments make it too easy for hate and discrimination to be spread with out consequences. There needs to be a way to stop the hate spreading but also still give people the oppertunity to express their comments so i think this is a good idea	To ensure freedom of speech is still maintained, moderation needs to be carried out fairly. To achieve this, we need to understand what is hate speech and what are the lines that seperate that with constructive criticism. Attached is an article by the Standford encyclopedia of physiosphy regarding hate speech. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hate-speech/
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	I think there should a program that verify the comment before they are displayed on the newpaper
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	Absolutely, hate speech forms thoughts, which forms character which leads to violent actions with enough time. It's a very serious issue that causes real world harm to marginalized communities when left unchecked.	I agree with this position since when providing personal data people would be less incentivized to starting hate speach
__label__noRel	I agree with this point of view - a lot of the times I hear people railing against the censorship of hatespeech it is because they aren't aware of the damage they are causing or have been caught out saying something they didn't think was bad to begin with	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	I think comments give the ability to the users to express their opinion on what is described in the articles and this is an important rule for democracy. Removing the ability to comment in my view is basically limiting free speech. I also believe that user do not need necessarily to be identifiable, being anonymous is fine as long as they respect others and their opinions.
__label__noRel	Completely agree with this! Both by human moderator and maybe AI to help identifying and flagging posts that could contain hate speech based on keywords.	In the digital world we live in - unfortunately hate speech is part and parcel of the benefits of having such an open forum and allowing everyone to have a voice. Hate speech is made by a minuscule minority of people. Perhaps have a 'report hate speech' button that members of the community can use.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	I think that the introduction of moderators to remove any hate speech would be beneficial. Perhaps the introduction of guidelines as to what constitutes permitted negative comments.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	I think we should just collect personal information. It works in South Korea. People will behave if their are not anonymous. Modertors are important too, but not enough,
__label__noRel	But then public opinion would be silenced.	I tend to agree that newspapers should provide spaces for dicussion. It encourages people to read about the topic before making comments and peopel can easily reference reference the article in their comments. I think this allows for a more fruitful and productive discussion that on other platforms e.g. social media. However, hate speech is certainly an issue and easily derails conversations. While moderation of hate speech would be ideal, the burden on the newspaper is likely too great to do this manually. Perhaps a mixture of auto-moderation (flagging/removing key words), manual review by the newspaper and some form of community moderation may work well together.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	I think it is important for newspapers to provide a platform for people to express and discuss their opinions. Being able to hear other peoples' opinions is an important part of educating oneself, so completely eliminating a comment section seems unprogressive.	Implementing a software that detects comments including hate speech, like the ones on social networks. Also including a report button for poeple to report hate speech comments
__label__noRel	everyone has the right to share their opinions, however online comments make it too easy for hate and discrimination to be spread with out consequences. There needs to be a way to stop the hate spreading but also still give people the oppertunity to express their comments so i think this is a good idea	to reduce hate speech it is important to raise the stakes of what happens if you are caught. scientific evidence and criminological theory shows that if someone perceives greater risk in their actions, they are more likely to desist.
__label__noRel	I believe that punishment would cause more polarization because people may have more negative feelings towards newspaper websites with comments sections. Like what AllisonK said, education is a better preventative measure. If punishment is necessary, it should involve education that the commentator actively engages in.	Freedom of speech can be used as catch-all term to justify the use and propagation of bigoted and hateful language. If we accept that some language is not acceptable due to it's clearly hateful nature then we have to acknowledge that some form of censorship of those particular instances has to occur. I would suggest that eliminating all such spaces from newspaper websites would have a massive detrimental effect on valid, non-bigoted, freedom of speech a cornerstone of western life. We don't ban all cars because some people speed dangerously, we monitor the roads and ban the bad drivers. I suggest that as long as readers comments are monitored continually they should remain.
__label__noRel	This is frequently used in social media platforms now, but it can be quite time consuming. Also the tone of a statement can be misinterpreting in text format.	The editor must appoint a diverse panel, meaning from different backgrounds to screen comments
__label__noRel	I agree	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	I disagree, try to read everyone's idea. Some are feasible and doable	You can let people create an account with a full name so they will have to think more about what they write and can't so easily spew hate
__label__noRel	Removing the comments limits speech, it goes against our freedom	There have to a way to remove hate speech before it could reach the comment space, the comment space is important because some people will help to improve the online newspaper
__label__noRel	Accountability is a great idea	There is no need to reduce hate speech, we just need to accept it. Banning or reducing hate speech is just censorship which is not acceptable.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	By using a tool to search for hate speech
__label__noRel	Total elimination of comments would not allow a discussion to take place	Every person should be traceable, so they are accountable. If your comments consist of hate speech or are offensive then you be accounable.
__label__noRel	I agree that with good moderation it is possible to create an environment where people can openly discuss topics.	Have human and AI to verify potential hateful speech. Given our current resources we should be able to allocate a human check given the rating of the flag by the AI
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	I think that readers who use hate speech should be reported and temporarily banned from the site, as I believe that we need comments section in online newspaper articles. It is important to share your views as we have freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I agree that anybody being allowed to comment can give rise to fake news in comment sections	By having technology that can detect hate speech so that it can be blocked before it is posted.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	Some hate speech is actually illegal, so that should definitely be reported and removed. https://www.report-it.org.uk/reporting_internet_hate_crime
__label__noRel	I agree. A big importance for newspapers is the comment section and people's opinion to what they have written. Although, the companies should take some responsibility to monitor the comments and what the other users will see.	The lines between hate speech and freedom of speecg and expression and constantly getting blurred further and further.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Take a few minutes to breathe, meditate, and physically calm your body down before you start typing your response.

__label__noRel	I feel newspapers don't work well and an interactive medium anyway. "letters to the editor" might be an avenue	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	Reducing hate speech shouldn't be the focus. The problem lies in the reactions to it - in particular, giving the drastic perspectives too much attention. This attention only encourages more of the debate and problematic perspectives. Though total ignorance would also be unfair, so really we need a position of just LESS attention and care given to such perspectives.
__label__noRel	It may be a high-cost approach, but worthwhile for our modern society to prioritise for the good of a healthy, functioning nation.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	I agree, we cannot compromise free speech, we need to find a way to allow free speech whilst targeting the removal of hate speech	we could filter the comments and have a panel to decide
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	having a screener in the background conrtolling everything thats coming in and also comment section
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	Hate speech is a blurred line and comes in different forms based on factors such as geography.	Completely doing away with the comment section would not be beneficial to the readers experience as reading other peoples thoughts is what sets online media apart from offline media. It plays a role in keeping the discussion going. It would be smart to rather monitor comments to ensure hate speech or utterances of a vile nature are greatly reduced through the use of some sort of algorithm that picks up on problematic words and deletes comments or it being done manually by people who will moderate the comment section.
__label__noRel	https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons	The newspaper website platform owners should be held accountable for any hate speech that occurs on their website and they can combat hate speech allowing fellow readers to be able to flag/report posts that they deem hateful.The moderators can then investigate.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	someone to check their posts before the article goes live, like a robot think
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	block the person who always use hate speech
__label__noRel	I agree with you, anonymity does seem to increase the level of hate speech and trolling. I found this article interesting though, it talks about the risks of splintering the internet if AI is used to limit speech too strongly. I found it interesting https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/03/29/the-future-of-free-speech-trolls-anonymity-and-fake-news-online/	I also believe that a filter or having a group of moderators constantly filtering out the negative - hate speech would be beneficial. Similar to other social media platforms, users of the platform perhaps should be allowed to flag or report comments that aren't appropriate,and then a moderator should check the report and take the steps necessary to make the platform a safe space.
__label__noRel	Absolutely true. Everyone has freedom of speech. We live in a democratic country where everyone have the right to speak and all voices need to be heard. It is up to the individual to make sure that they put forward their points without being too aggressive and not getting carried away.	We can remove it fairly by making rules and monitoring the comment section.
__label__noRel	I like this idea as it contains inbuilt responsibility, so it motivates the people in power to fix it, and competition between different newspapers will breed more effective methods to reduce hate speech effectively, which other platforms will copy and adapt	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	This article shows the benefits that controlling hate speech has, especially on diverse groups. It would be wrong to not attempt to control this situation.	Comment sections are meant for social media platforms. The newspaper can post on a platform such as twitter in order to get comments - while disabling comments on their own platform.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way.

__label__noRel	Hate speech should not be taken as a form of free speech	ALthough the idea of free speech is important, it cannot be used as an excuse to upset others and use racist/sexist/ violent language.
__label__noRel	Yes, I think this is the right approach	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	I have already said that people who have already displayed hate speech on a website should be banned from giving their opinion.
__label__noRel	This may be challenging for newspaper websites with large audiences and therefore a great deal of traffic (which is a likely goal for most/all newspaper companies). The volume of new comments following a breaking story would likely be quite great and the task would very taxing for moderators. If the proportion of content that is hateful is quite high, you may be looking at quite a bit of burnout amongst the moderators who may quickly grow cynical, jaded, and emotionally exhausted from filtering out so much hatred and profanity.	Addressing hate speech does not mean limiting or prohibiting freedom of speech. It means keeping hate speech from escalating into something more dangerous, particularly incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence, which is prohibited under international law. https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.

__label__noRel	Completely correct, effective moderation is the answer.	This should be done with a mix of moderation, community flagging and reporting before moving to disabling comments, based ona mix of moderative judgement and amount of flagging
__label__noRel	Yes, and moderators ensure that comments stick to this	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	I think this is a bad idea. The comments section is an important means of debunking biased articles or potentially gaining a different perspective on what others think about what you've just read.	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	AI could be used to flag hate speech, meaning comments that are hate speech can be flagged at the time. The tech needs more work though based on this article: https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/04/1025742/ai-hate-speech-moderation/
__label__noRel	Eliminating the space for reader comments would be violating free speech, in my opinion it would be much better to have every incident recorded as a Non-crime hate incident'. The government needs to have stricter and clearer laws on what entails hate crime and hate incidents.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	A possible way to address hate speech on newspaper sites would be to incorporate both human moderators and some sort of AI that monitors for hateful words and comments. The requirement to submit personally identifying information before commenting might also help because without this then anyone can create a fake name that hides the person's true identity so therefore more likely to engage in hate speech. If personal information is required, then hate speech would be less likely.
__label__noRel	I think my idea is very good	As I saw some commentary on this platform, my opinion is that we need 2 things. A submission of personal data before one can have access to post anything related and real time moderation of the comments.

__label__noRel	Yes this is a very important consideration in that we dont operate in a homogenous society. and culturally we are not the same, so what I consider harsh hate speech might just be considered banter to another group of society.

__label__noRel	This is impractical for high traffic websites that will receive thousands of reports	In as much as we can not let the spread of hate speech continue, closing the comment section is not the solution. The newspaper website should have the option for readers to be able to report comments that include hate speech and moderators should be appointed to check "users" that are violating the rules. There can be filters in place that remove posts that have some of the common hateful and derogatory phrases. outlining the rules and regulations for the website users can help
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.

Be more strict when allowing people to create profiles, that require identification before allowing anybody to comment. Stopping people being anonymous enough to feel confident while posting hate speech I think will be more beneficial than restricting peoples comments.
__label__noRel	People will tick that they agree, but write what they want anyway! And if they're anonymous there are no repercussions for them.	Hate speech is something is completely unacceptable and should be eradicated by all means necessary however regulations are our best bet if we are to maintain freedom of speech at the same time.

__label__noRel	Have to agree with this as this will allow people to freely express their views without the fear of hate speech	I think that hate speech should be reduced through widescale education about the origins, hurts and trauma behind words which are used. By educating people learn how to respect or debate in effective ways without insulting or offending. UNESCO are suggesting that addressing hate speech through education can bring respect for each other.
__label__noRel	comments don't need to involve hate speeck, one can comment without using these types of expressions,	Removing the comment section from online newspapers is not the answer. Allowing people to post their opinions is healthy and a normal part of human society- people will not always agree.

There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	Proper moderation by the website owner should be required, whether using human moderators or using technology to flag potential hate speech for human review and action.
__label__noRel	would definitely need a team of moderators	The idea that media should be able to stop a conversation is wrong and this is what would happen if comments were removed.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	I'm a firm supporter of freedom of speech but the internet as we all know can be a cruel place. A lot of individuals hide behind their screens and say things to people that they wouldn't have the guts to say in person given the opportunity. So with that being said I stand for the elimination of the space bar for readers.
__label__noRel	Exactly the newspapers must be the place to comment because they give us the article but this article is written by a journalist. Therefore, the article represent the ideas of the journalist. Not all the time they are neutral. Sometimes they are even politically influenced. This often provokes discussions and where else can people say their opinion if there is no comment section?	the newspapers should have an algorithm that can detect comments which go against the community guidelines and ban these accounts. Spam accounts should also be detected and banned if they do no contribute constructively to the newspapers.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I agree, this would be the perfect balance	I'm finding replying to comments here really awkward. As soon as I start typing the page moves, grrrr! However, I don't agree with vetting comments. I do agree with free speech, but not hate speech. People are entitled to an opinion without having to be nasty or a keyboard warrior. Moderating could be used to take out hateful comments, without taking away a well rounded debate, but where those lines are drawn is anyones guess!
__label__noRel	anyone writing things against the prevailing narrative will be shut down. George Orwell wrote this would happen and women would be the ones easily taken in and become enforcers.	I enjoy reading through comments and I don't think that they should be removed, but there should be a lot more monitoring going on to remove any hateful ones as soon as they are posted.
__label__noRel	If a moderator removes a comment then they should have to justify why to the contributor who may be upset at their comment being removed.	https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3394231.3397902
__label__noRel	This is very true and I think that by focusing on educating others before they decide to give an opinion as most hate speech is just a form of ignorance from others.	There is no discussion on free speech to have : free speech is absolute or not. If you don't like free speech then go live in China.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	pro
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	We need to create a society where we can debate with each other respectfully, we can know which platforms to use and not rile each other up without offending. It is widely suggested that education can address the extent of hate speech: https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/addressing-hate-speech-through-education-global-education-ministers-conference. However, this needs to go hand in hand with moderation of sites to ensure people are kept within reason. It is not a case of any one single solution.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	I agree that discussions should be moderated. But what happens when the moderators themselves are biased?
__label__noRel	Everyone has a right to say but it should be put across correctly	the comment section should not be disabled as is it there for the readers to engage with the content uploaded so it makes no sense to close it, however there should be restrictions.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	Advanced AI is the ultimate answer. It is the cheapest and most unbiased moderator option.

__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	I agree, reported and removed. The person should also be given a statement reasoning as to why they were removed and reported. They could also be given warnings for this.	Just don't write about it
__label__noRel	we can never be sure when it comes to people. It will be dangerous should people be allowed to express themselves	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	Yes, public should also be able to express an opinion on a subject.	Asking people to identify themselves when doing their registration. If we remove the anonymous factor, people will be afraid to act like trolls.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	This is very sensible.	i am against the removal of the comment section and i believe that regulations and clear rules are the way to go, have systems put into place and enforce the rules. let there be punishable offences for rule breakers.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Use technology to monitor and block users
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way.

__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Computers should be able to detect hate speech if there is any and report and remove that comment whinin minutes of posting it
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	I think hate speech is always going to be a problem unfortunately, and although websites can monitor comments and remove any hate speech what ultimately is needed is teaching people there are better ways to get their opinions across and better use of freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think and AI could filter this faster than a person. Also giving people to opportunity to report will help as well.	I agree with the point of view that there should be a broad spectrum of moderators to stop any particular biased opinion or agenda from controlling the comments.
__label__noRel	https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/juraba52&div=30&id=&page=	hate speech is inevitable
__label__noRel	I disagree people need to show what they think about what has been written	everyone should be entitled to comment and have opinions but the comment section should be checked and hate comments deleted and that user blocked on the website
__label__noRel	Freedom of speech is important, if we remove comments we remove other perspectives. Not all comments are hate speech	Debate should be available upon all topics. To reduce this availability reduces the opportunities for people to express their opinions and undermines democratic processes. Hate speech should be managed and eliminated before publication.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	Disabling comments reduces free speech and makes everything monitored and authorised - then you have to question who is controlling what we see?
__label__noRel	Because pretending as if it's not happening doesnt mean it will stop when there is a disable comment.	We can start by encouraging people to debate and say their opinions to incite meaningful and helpful conversations and comments instead of hate and other harmful communication types
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	People who take part in hate speech should be dealt with lawfully so as its a form of cyber-bullying, that way less people will resort to hate speech
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	some people "troll" by writing inflammatory remarks, but it is fundamental to a free society to have free discussion. Any attempts at calling something "hate speech" will be only about stopping anything that goes against the narratives of the rich establishment.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Newspapers should have an algorithm that catches certain words or phrases which are hateful in nature. These words will be automatically flagged up and accounts that are flagged x amount of times should then be restricted from commenting for a period of time. If after this period, they continue to try and post comments with hateful content, they should be banned entirely from commenting.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	I understand that there will always be people saying the comment section needs to stay as we are all allowed free speech.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	Have moderators who constantly monitor and remove hateful posts or ones that are inciting others/goading others.
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	I feel like people's wellbeing should be the priority, and those targeted by hate speech might be gravely affected by commenter's words. To me this is more important than people's right to free speech.	There absolutely are ways to facilitate healthy conversation and debates without allowing hate speech. Both algorithms and human moderation are ways to ensure debate can continue without resorting to abuse.
__label__noRel	good idea but you nead the right person with a good moral compass on board,to give a level playing field for all.	I think I would prefer to see that comments sections are removed rather than untruths being pushed at people.
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	modrate what can be posted before it allowed to be published finally
__label__noRel	I agree	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Tracking details could become intrusive.	Hate speech blocking will violate human rights to freedom of speech and cause people to feel opressed, as that would mean that they can not voice out their opinions.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	I've gone over most opinions on this topic. The best solution would be a bot that would filter out the harmful comments
__label__noRel	We should avoid appearing like we are doing cancel culture	Comment sections need to be well-moderated, and if algoritmic or user comment flagging is used this needs to also be reviewed by a human moderator to ensure that there is no bias or bad faith reporting going on.
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	With rights comes responsibility. We all have freedom of speech but it is our responsibility to ensure that our speech does not cause harm on others. If people do not want to be responsible in their speech, then their speech should be reduced because things have consequences. So, the hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by removing comments with hate speech or having a software that can identify hate speech in a comment before it is posted.
__label__noRel	I agree	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	Agreeing with others here: a standard of moderation would have to be communicated to the user, with straightforward policies of flagging or reporting potentially hateful comments. A synthesis of live and algorithmic moderators might be best, as certain words can be auto-flagged for review, whereas other things might involve a more delicate touch.
__label__noRel	Unfortunately,others might say it is censorship	There is no cure for hate speech, but there is a way to stand up against it. Speak out against hate speech - fight racism and bigotry with love, empathy, compassion, and strength. We may not be able to eliminate hatred entirely, but the more steps we can take to educate and support human beings, and speak out against injustice, the better this world will become.

__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	appreciate people have different views
__label__noRel	I agree!	I think it'll be hard to do so, because everyone has the right to freedom of speech, but unless the comments brings acts of violence on people then it must be deleted
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Readers that feel the need to put hate speech in comment section only do so because of the way they can remain anonymous online. In everyday life you could go months and if not years without hearing hate speech, whilst it can almost be a daily occurrence when browsing online in various forums, social media platforms or comment sections on news websites. Finding a way for readers/users not to remain anonymous and having real consequences for spreading hate speech would reduce this issue.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.

__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	I tend to agree that newspapers should provide spaces for dicussion. It encourages people to read about the topic before making comments and peopel can easily reference reference the article in their comments. I think this allows for a more fruitful and productive discussion that on other platforms e.g. social media. However, hate speech is certainly an issue and easily derails conversations. While moderation of hate speech would be ideal, the burden on the newspaper is likely too great to do this manually. Perhaps a mixture of auto-moderation (flagging/removing key words), manual review by the newspaper and some form of community moderation may work well together.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	An article proving AI can be helpful, but can struggle to interpret or detect certain things, suggesting manual reviewing is still very important. https://www.latrobe.edu.au/nest/can-combat-rise-online-hate-speech/ On another note, I also think anonymity plays a huge role in what people allow themselves to post online and think that certain platforms should consider only allowing people to comment under their own identity rather than online handles and such.
__label__noRel	yes. the website can simply have words that are not accepted in the comments. this can minimize or eliminate hate speech altogether	Younger people are susceptible to propaganda by the establishment "elites", they will be easy targets of manipulation by saying that ALL opposing views are "hate speech".
__label__noRel	This would be a great idea, however, it's also important to take into notice that everyone has their own biased; so one statement could be hate speech to one but not the other	realistically hate speech cannot be eliminated but preventative measures cane be put in place to minimise its presence
__label__noRel	Whilst moderation can be good, you're at the whims of the moderators own thoughts and prejudices. And at times may not be acting in the interests of the organisation they're working for.	This article made me reflect on the definition of hate speech and I aggree with blocking comments that go against a persons protected characteristics - if a comment like that is made, it should instantly be banned from the platform / comment section. https://about.fb.com/news/2017/06/hard-questions-hate-speech/
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	Freedpn of speech doesnt mean you must promote hate speech on newspapers, it basically means you free to voice out your concerns in around society in a more respectfull manner.
__label__noRel	I agree	every comment submitted by readers must be checked internally for hate speech
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed.

__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way.

__label__noRel	https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-and-real-harm	This is a win or loose situation. People will still continue with their comments even if it is not on the newspapers website. A person can take a screenshot of the topic and then twit it on twitter and then people will give their different opinions. The newspaper can still allow for readers comment however, the hate speech comments can be filtered. This is a democratic world and people have a right to have an opinion in what becomes available to them
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	I think we have to use some fact checking system that allows us to present thoughts and opinions, the system can block derogatory comments. This allows for a calm debate
__label__noRel	Disinformation is rampant: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/magazine/free-speech.html	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.

__label__noRel	I agree	I don't think we can police websites 100% but if comments are moderated I think we can reach quite a high degree of compliance

__label__noRel	I disagree. I think other readers of hate speech could be influenced by it making the issue spread even further.

__label__noRel	I dont believe in censorship though. Commentary and opinions are important.

__label__noRel	Less moderation and legal issues	reducing hate speech on the newspaper websites is possible without taking the drastic measures of completely cancelling the comment section one way of doing that there should be moderators who approve the comment before they are published on the website.
__label__noRel	Being open to the voice of the opposition means that we can hear another side of the argument	Our freedom to do anything as part of a society is limited. Thus freedom of speech should be no different. Poeple need to be held accountable for their mistakes, so everybody else's rights will be protected. So having a set of keywords which are not allowed to be used is a way of reminding the writter that using the offensive word he/she is trying to use is considered a crime. An additional way to handle that is having the flag option by users and a team of moderators who follow a standard and will verify if flagged comments should be maintained or not. Lastly, anonymity might bring a feeling of impunity and even its possibility, so a way to avoid that is allowing one profile per person/email, where a fake username can be set, but, in the backstage, the website will know who it is that wrote each comment.
__label__noRel	Potentially reduces correction or dissenting information on the article	Ultimately the comments are needed to gather feedback in certain situations, removing the comments section wouldn't help us eliminate hate speech because where information needs to be gathered, no blacklist will help.
__label__noRel	But what if the opinion of others infringes upon the rights of another. As much as we should all be able to express our opinion it shouldn't be at the expense of others.	I think comments give the ability to the users to express their opinion on what is described in the articles and this is an important rule for democracy. Removing the ability to comment in my view is basically limiting free speech. I also believe that user do not need necessarily to be identifiable, being anonymous is fine as long as they respect others and their opinions.
__label__noRel	However it could be argued that t it is so difficult for moderators to see the difference between someone practicing their freedom of speech and the idea of hate speech against a protected characteristic.	In as much as we can not let the spread of hate speech continue, closing the comment section is not the solution. The newspaper website should have the option for readers to be able to report comments that include hate speech and moderators should be appointed to check "users" that are violating the rules. There can be filters in place that remove posts that have some of the common hateful and derogatory phrases. outlining the rules and regulations for the website users can help
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	Recent political positions in the UK have lead to more fighting for 'free speech' and saying that it is ok to be offended - this is shown in a police news release (https://www.college.police.uk/article/protecting-freedom-expression-updated-guidance). I would disagree - offending people is unacceptable.
__label__noRel	No hiding behind false ID	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	I agree we can work to prevent it, but systems can be complicated to introduce or can be controversial in themselves	There is a careful balance to be made between protecting others from the effects of hate speech and protecting free speech. Online hate speech unfortunately can have the effect of increasing violence against minorities (https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons) but blocking all free speech because of the actions of a few seems like a poor decision. More must be done to remove hate speech online quickly and this means spending more money tackling it.

__label__noRel	Well then what is your proposition	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	I think by holding the people that use hateful speech accountable i.e., blocking them from accessing newspaper websites
__label__noRel	It might lead to fake profiles	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	A possible way to address hate speech on newspaper sites would be to incorporate both human moderators and some sort of AI that monitors for hateful words and comments. The requirement to submit personally identifying information before commenting might also help because without this then anyone can create a fake name that hides the person's true identity so therefore more likely to engage in hate speech. If personal information is required, then hate speech would be less likely.
__label__noRel	To add to my previous comment about having clear and established rules I refer to https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/article-1388145/House-Rules.html The daily mail is well known for having a very open and sometimes contentious comment section.

You can allow people to say controversial things as long as they stay within some boundaries	There should be a strict comment management system in place, someone has to supervise it and react (and possibly penalise) to users spreading hate speech. The comments should not be anonymous since people feel more inclined to be hostile when hiding under a pseudonym. Maybe asking to verify your identity before posting a comment would make people think more before spreading hate.

__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it.

__label__noRel	I also agree with this position. letting people fully express themselves will fully enable sourcing The root of the problem	The only way to combat hate speech is through open debate. Restricting any form of speech (even hate speech) could lead to hateful views becoming unchallenged and potentially result in violence. There is also the issue that newspapers could define hate speech as certain comments they don't like destroying any potential for open debate. By maintaining open debate hate speech can be called out and as a result, become less frequent.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	you ca reduce hate speech by adding an ai bot that can distinguishly remove between violent words from a comment. A report button is as useful which can allow for moderators to review comments and decide on the level of polarization.
__label__noRel	Banning comment section is not a solution at all, the ban of comment sections is also the ban of freedom of speech/ opinions over all. The idea behind comment sections is for readers to share their different thoughts regarding the News with each other which is very important.	Counting on peoples's good behavior does not work. (https://www.washingtonpost.com/discussions/2020/04/13/community-rules/)
__label__noRel	I dont agree with this as sure it counters the hate speech but that makes me question the reliability of the news article	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	A team of moderators would have their own bias so it is not possible to know what is really hate speech.	By using a tool to search for hate speech
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	I know this has been discussed a few times potentially in reply to comments but I'd like to repeat it again: language is complex and you can't simply ban or flag certain terms or phrases and think you catch all the hate speech comments etc. While a report button and the use of a software that can support a human moderator is in essence a good idea, it might also delete comments that do not actually contain HS or completely miss others overall. I think this decision by the newspaper turned into an entire discussion of manageability of monitoring discussion sections and away from the ethical considerations.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	I agree with most of the commenters here, there needs to be moderation. Even if you don't agree with the arguments there are ways of saying it that do not fall into 'hate speech'.
__label__noRel	This is frequently used in social media platforms now, but it can be quite time consuming. Also the tone of a statement can be misinterpreting in text format.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Strict moderation of comments prior to them being published may be the only way to limit hate speech on comments sections.
__label__noRel	it feels right	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes.

__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	using key words and having moderators might help

Nobody needs to know that Tony from Bognor thinks All Them Lot Should Go Home, because Tony is a twat who shouldn't be given a platform.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	One solution to reduce hate speech is by disabling the comment section altogether for most important topics/controversial topics. Yu can actually leave the comment section open for generic topics/non-contoversial topics.
__label__noRel	absolutely agree with this and think that this could lead to people have openminded discussions and would promote a different way of thinking which is okay	i agree that moderators have their uses but then unless they are trained properly their biases may creep in

__label__noRel	Newspapers don't have an interest in this	I would not eliminate the hate speech right away but rather alarm the user and ask them to refrain from that kind of speech or ask them to elaborate or explain the reasons for the anger. Maybe as a moderator I would try to understand their viewpoint because by removing the speech there will be just more anger and hatred.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Censoring speech prevents progress as a soceity. (https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2016/04/free-speech-important/)
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	I don't think removing the comment section reduces hate speech per se, it just pushes it elsewhere. I can't help feeling this sort of censorship is an infringement on free speech.
__label__noRel	You're trusting an algorithm that would need to be trained by humans - so the AI itself could still be biased.	More Admin and block buttons

__label__noRel	The problem with allowing commentary to flourish without restrictions is that it can undermine the credibility of legitimate news sources. Frank Waddell, associate journalism professor at the University of Florida, noted that “If you see a bunch of individuals online who are leaving negative comments on a news article, you might think most people are evaluating this news as low quality,” Waddell said. “When asked to evaluate the news yourself, you might also think the news is more negative relative to someone who reads that same article without comments.” https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.

__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it.

__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	We can reduce hate speech by regulating comments that are attacking a certain group with no true basis or facts
__label__noRel	The best way to deal with the issues of hate speech might be to ban the use of specific words or phrases that may amount to hate speech. Removing the comment section completely just allows the publication to share whatever information they want without the opportunity to be challenged by the public.	A possible way to address hate speech on newspaper sites would be to incorporate both human moderators and some sort of AI that monitors for hateful words and comments. The requirement to submit personally identifying information before commenting might also help because without this then anyone can create a fake name that hides the person's true identity so therefore more likely to engage in hate speech.

__label__noRel	I don't believe that anybody who had the capacity to give rise to fake news can do something more powerful than commenting, and I think that filters being put into place would be more productive than completely eliminating to option to comment - this phenomenon will always exist and can easily take place on other platforms regardless	It's a balance. There should be the ability to pre- and post-moderate comments.

__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	Hate speech does more harm than good
__label__noRel	This is more than just censoring	create a team of people that can look for and remove the hate speech and leave all other respectful arguments to make the comment section diverse.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	It is easy to be hateful online when you are anonymous. Before being able to comment on newspaper websites, users should be required to sign up using traceable methods (eg. some form of identification). The comment section should regularly be monitored and any users who post hate speech should face serious consiquences
__label__noRel	Its unlikely there will be such software that recognises all slang / racist words	newspaper might remove comment section as a way to prevent hate speech. however, it does remove freedom of speech to those who would like to express themselves through comment section.

__label__noRel	Some opinions may be trigger ing to others	Moderation is key. Plenty of newspapers and online media are able to keep comments open with a bit of moderation.
__label__noRel	Anonymity may also prevent people to explore ideas they feel are taboo and prevent them from seeking help. e.g. addiction, some LGBTQ+ issues that are taboo in certain cultures etc.	I think that hate speech should be reduced through widescale education about the origins, hurts and trauma behind words which are used. By educating people learn how to respect or debate in effective ways without insulting or offending. UNESCO are suggesting that addressing hate speech through education can bring respect for each other.
__label__noRel	That will take too long time to do manually, so it's best to ban some words in the start. If the user is using to many of the banned words, then ban the user automatically.	In order to reduce hate speech in the comments section, newspapers need to employ moderators on their platforms so that there can be someone watching and removing all types of hate speech in the comments section.
__label__noRel	I think the comment section is a good space for people to interact with the author instead of removing they should create or have an inbuilt AI that identifies bad words and mark the post as bad	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section.

I also think that there should be moderators looking at every post before it is published online.
__label__noRel	surely this should be the job of the editor to make sure the journalists are impartial	I think the best way to reduce hate speech in newspaper websites is to ensure that the site can detect words and phrases that can be considered hate speech, and block them from being posted on the comment section. Also, a moderator to approve each comment section before it becomes publicly accessible is a notion which can be adopted as well.
__label__noRel	we should be able to share love, this world needs that	Newspaper websites should invest more in technology that can be used to detect hate speech and not allow it to be posted. They should only allow comments posted in the language that the software will understand so that it is able to eliminate hate speech without difficulties. they should also be willing to punish people who post hate speech by reporting them to the authorities.

__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it.

__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	I think there should be red flagged or blacklisted words that shouldn't be allowed to be used in reader's comments.

__label__noRel	I disagree because it is still tolerating that intolerant people express themselves and make their opinions visible. Even if they are removed,it will take a while for that to happen and this hateful message may have already found an echo in another bigot.	Removing the comment facility in no way infringes free speech. The content providers, newspapers, are at liberty to provide discussion space or not as they see fit. The use of a moderator might be useful but this seems a great investment of time to little effect. There are obviously those who enjoy using comment spaces to express extreme and unthought out opinions as well as to insert hate speech. Perhaps only those who have subscribed to a news source should be allowed to comment.
__label__noRel	are we listening?	Although it would be fair to allow for both critical and positive input, I believe that newspaper websites should have a mechanism in place that can identify hate speech and restrict individuals who use it. This would prevent readers from freely using hate speech.

The rights and liberties of journalists and their role in fostering and developing peaceful societies should be emphasized in media ethics education. The political, social, and cultural rights of individuals and groups, including the freedom of expression, must be made more widely known, as well as the obligations and societal repercussions that come with press freedom. Journalists need to have the knowledge and abilities to spot hate speech and disseminate anti-hate messaging.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted.

__label__noRel	I agree that many people have different platforms to air their opinions these days, in fact it is very easy to create fake identities, and posts.

Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	But a negative comment is not bad especially if what was done deserves to reprimanded.	Comment space encourages discussion of important topics and allows free exchange of information and so should not be eliminated. Independent moderators should be used in order to ensure that hate speech is quickly deleted and encourage users to express their ideas without using inappropriate or aggressive language.
__label__noRel	so moderators and filters are needed	Identifying users with hate speech and restricting their accounts from using the platform and commenting on it.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.

__label__noRel	strongly agree with andreas	I think it is important for people to be able to comment on newspapers websites, but I think there needs to be a way of moderating the comments section to prevent/remove hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree with this statement. When we didn't have any computers, people didn't have the luxury to comment instantly.	While freedom of speech is a human right, it is imperative to be cognizant of the fact that each and every person has the right to have their rights respected. It is for this reason that readers comments cannot be removed. Everyone has the right to make a comment and we do not necessarily always have to agree, we always have to respect. A system can be put in place to remove any vulgar language.
__label__noRel	who is in charge of moderating the conversation and who decides what is permitted to be discussed? Moderating conversation is a very dangerous precedent	Ultimately the comments are needed to gather feedback in certain situations, removing the comments section wouldn't help us eliminate hate speech because where information needs to be gathered, no blacklist will help.
__label__noRel	However, we need a solution for this, else we may not be able to have any platforms at all.	Proper moderation by the website owner should be required, whether using human moderators or using technology to flag potential hate speech for human review and action.

__label__noRel	it feels right	You have to log on to write a comment, having character/post limits, comments must be verified by someone who checks for hate speech before approving the comment for publication
__label__noRel	I believe it is fair for hate speech comments to be censored, because it could lead to violent public behavior. (read this: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech)	It's a balance. There should be the ability to pre- and post-moderate comments. Pre- using technology to recognise potentially offensive words as well as closer moderation of articles on potentially controversial topics. Post-moderation to allow readers to report offensive topics which will be hidden from view until moderated.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	One cost-effective way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites while promoting reader comments is to outsource reader comments to social media. Comment sections can show comments for the article from social media platforms, while encouraging users to post comments onto these platforms. This way, hate speech can be reduced by social media platforms, which are more experienced with content moderation, have extensive rules in place, and have economies of scale with regard to content moderation compared to newspapers.

__label__noRel	I disagree, comment sections allow the public to engage with the news and find people similar to them	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	Honest	Removing the comment space from online newspapers is definitely not fair but I believe that it should be regulated by A-I. This way readers could share different opinions and thoughts abut the topic at hand without offending one another.
__label__noRel	Yes, any form of hate speech should never be tolerated.	The most effective way would be to produce effective and fair algorithms that can detect use of hate speech along with help of human moderation.
__label__noRel	Continuing as normal.	Some people will always use hate speech and hide behind their computer, There needs to be some sort of filter added to flag such comments and people and a ban put on the user
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	In order for effective moderation to occur, some kind of consensus or clearly reachable policy on what constitutes hate speech (including dogwhistling, which may be less clear to a lay viewer) would need to be in place. This might require too much buy-in from commenters, but is necessary if anything can be consistently enforced.
__label__noRel	yes. good moderators are the key	By implimenting a system that can filter out all comments before the comments are added to the website or newspaper for the readers to read

__label__noRel	Free speech should trump hate speech because hate speech can also be interpreted as political speech where by dissent of the prevailing political and cultural agendas are not accepted or an attempt is made to use "hate speech" to create a stigma around political agendas that are unpopular.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	but then how would that be any different to newspaper comments sections? the folk who write hateful comments would migrate to different platform, then you'd have the same problem just on a different platform.	This is not just a newspaper comment section problem... it's a social media problem as well, more like an internet problem. We need way to not push people away, but educate them.

Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	Guidelines and some automation (i.e. flagging the use of key words associated with hate speech, including swear words and racist nomenclature) could work.	I disagree. Comments might be useful for users and also the owners of the newspapers. Though, asking people to identify themselves when registering could help reduce hate speech, as people would not be able to do whatever they want anonymously.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	Many people are against the reducing of hate speech from newspaper article, and I am with them on this. The main reason for putting comment section on newspaper websites was for readers to leave a comment, people will always have something to say whether it is good or bad. But AI can still be used to remove comments that can be severely harmful.
__label__noRel	Regulation of the comment section will definitely help reduce the hate speech	I also believe that a filter or having a group of moderators constantly filtering out the negative - hate speech would be beneficial. Similar to other social media platforms, users of the platform perhaps should be allowed to flag or report comments that aren't appropriate,and then a moderator should check the report and take the steps necessary to make the platform a safe space.
__label__noRel	How can we draw the fine line between hate speech and freedom of speech?	Monitoring of comment areas is not realistic
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	Moderation of both users and comments isn't difficult to implement and will weed out the idiots that want to ruin it.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	This article describes how censoring might lead users to leave platforms and join other platforms with lighter censoring rules https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/global-extremes/does-censoring-radical-right-social-media-work/
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.

__label__noRel	hate speech will be reduced	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	However, I tend to agree with this opinion: https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/why-ending-anonymity-would-not-make-social-media-better.php . I don't think hate speech will end with the end of anonymity. We have to think about the possibilities of safety for human rights activists that only come with anonimity.	Be more strict when allowing people to create profiles, that require identification before allowing anybody to comment. Stopping people being anonymous enough to feel confident while posting hate speech I think will be more beneficial than restricting peoples comments.
__label__noRel	Online would be a nicer place	Removing the comment section should not be an option, we should not lose the right to freedom of speech based on the likelihood that a few may post hateful comments, strict moderation and being able to report hate speech is the solution. Having people sign up for platforms and use ID to which they could be held personally accountable is an option as well. Hate Speech often comes from being able to hide behind a keyboard, screen and a fake username.
__label__noRel	yes this absolutly true, newspapers should not be acting like the censorship police	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	This is what most social media companies already do. Often the AI sensors the conversation based on the pre-selected criteria without the intervention of any human moderator, because there is too much traffic for humans to monitor. This leads to a reduction in free-speech.	I think the first step to reducing hate speech in readers comments should be in the form of a moderation team in which they filter inappropriate comments. I think it should be a group of people rather than AI to do this to ensure all hate speech within a variety of contexts are eliminated, as if this was done by a computer there is risk of hate spilling through. For example, hate speech on the social media platform Twitter can often be missed as users purposefully misspell hateful speech to ensure it does not flag up on the AI searches, going as far as hateful language misspelt actually trending on Twitter.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	While this would eliminate all hate speech, newspapers would not implement it, as the interaction drives hits on their site, so the comments section is an essential part of spreading the news person to person	block the person who always use hate speech
__label__noRel	takes away the ability to comment for everyone	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	you can add an AI system in the website that will scan all comments instantly after they have been posted and it can remove any hate speech before it is seen by many people on the comment section, this method is used by some online communication platforms.
__label__noRel	100% correct	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	every comment submitted by readers must be checked internally for hate speech
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Strict content moderation
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.

__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	By the whole nature of the newspapers removing this ability, who is to say the newspaper itself could be potentially spreading hate news?
__label__noRel	I agree most with this post, there's no reason to allow hate speech to exist on social platforms when it's so easy to moderate and control	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	The comment space gives users a way to vent out their frustration. It is not always nice to see derogatory language but when there is a healthy discussion, it helps people reading them to find very informative.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	There is no way to restrict speech without censorship...so remove the option to comment rather than to censor.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	yes, the lack of consequences is the problem. We can see from somewhere like facebook where peoples info is so easy to find that people have had negative consequences over their hateful posts so clearly being able to link back the comment to the person can help	https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons
__label__noRel	Human bias would still be at the very core of this moderation, but then again humans build algorithims too.

__label__noRel	This is impractical for high traffic websites that will receive thousands of reports	Some people just like to spread their negative vibes on strangers, not worried about serious consequences, as the worst thing that can happen to them is the comment being removed. There should be consequences!
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree	The lines between hate speech and freedom of speecg and expression and constantly getting blurred further and further.
__label__noRel	Hate speech is not the same thing as criticism. Criticism should be respectful and objective.	My final argument is that it is possible to monitor and reduce hate speech on website comments by using both AI and human intelligence
__label__noRel	yes. good moderators are the key	Limiting the algorithms push to only show negative or controversial viewpoints would go a long way to decreasing the hate comments.
__label__noRel	I agree that hate speech should not be tolerated, but I don't think that it requires the total removal of space for comments, as the comments add value. I believe that moderation is the way forward.	The key way to do it would be with very in-depth moderation which is non-biased and respects criticisms but its aware when a comment is taken too far and viewed as hate speech. the comment section should not be eliminated but mainly moderated and supervised
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	online newspaper will definately attract a lot of people if there is comment section as some people prefer to go through comments first to get insight of the content.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	yes, I agree, need moderators,	Moderation of the comments section
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	I strongly feel that comments are an essential part of the readers experience. It assists readers by giving them a broader sense and understanding of the topic being discussed. Removing them would be taking a way an integral part of that experience.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	There are other ways to reduce or block hateful comments without having to eliminate comment section.
__label__noRel	However it could be argued that t it is so difficult for moderators to see the difference between someone practicing their freedom of speech and the idea of hate speech against a protected characteristic.	The best way to curb hate speech would be to have the comments section moderated for any forms of hate speech. In this manner people who have an opinion with substance can have a say in whatever article that was published.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	You can reduce hate speech by moderating the comments, banning repeating offenders and requiring a phone number to create a account.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	I think this is a bad idea. The comments section is an important means of debunking biased articles or potentially gaining a different perspective on what others think about what you've just read.	appreciate people have different views
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	I have found that as well as reading the articles from newspapers, I have also been paying keen attention to the comments section of the article. Either on the newspaper site or on social media. I find that while the opinions of the article presens the views and research of the author, the comments offer an alternative viewpoint and opinions. A chance to see if the article hit the right note, and an opportunity to understand positives and negatives of a topic raised.
__label__noRel	Freedom of speech should never be taken away.	Debate should be available upon all topics. To reduce this availability reduces the opportunities for people to express their opinions and undermines democratic processes. Hate speech should be managed and eliminated before publication.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	There is no cure for hate speech, but there is a way to stand up against it. Speak out against hate speech - fight racism and bigotry with love, empathy, compassion, and strength. We may not be able to eliminate hatred entirely, but the more steps we can take to educate and support human beings, and speak out against injustice, the better this world will become.

Making sure commnect sections are heavily monitored.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	While hate speech can be harmful , it can also be helpful. If we can read through the speeches we can be able to determine what the problem is from the comments and improve.We can also create work limit on comments.
__label__noRel	Yes, I totally agree with this.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	It may limit potential information which could be spread in ways of educating people.	The question is? Is hate speech not part of free speech? I think people should be left to express themselves however they feel is appropriate as long as they are not breaking an laws
__label__noRel	It is important to actually define what hate speech is before an agreed education policy can be enacted.	There is a fine line between free speech and hate speech. I don't think there is any way to reduce this because people will take the stand and say that their free speech is being taken away from them.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	comments should be moderated but we cannot remove all the negative and leave the positive comments. it would look like the newspaper is being biased

If they post it, maybe a manual review can happen to determine if it was hate speech or not.

__label__noRel	Doing nothing because of a fear that doing something will be ineffective, means simply that nothing will definitely be achieved. Freedom of speech is definitely curtailed if people who are likely to be attacked are themselves, afraid to speak. The experience of CreepyPMs in keeping their site open, friendly and inclusive, using 30 moderators for a relatively small site and a tough policy where in essence that comments must be conductive to a supportive environment and if not, can be removed, even if they have not violated a specific rule, seems to potentially curtail freedom of speech and could silence valid criticism but can also "allow marginalised and targeted individuals who are not likely to share their stories or opinions when the door is left open to the rest of the world" to speak. https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation	I think that hate speech should be reduced through widescale education about the origins, hurts and trauma behind words which are used. By educating people learn how to respect or debate in effective ways without insulting or offending. UNESCO are suggesting that addressing hate speech through education can bring respect for each other.
__label__noRel	most comment sections usually generate comments that turn into arguements if unmoderated	Provide guidance on what is and isnt hate speech would work i think
__label__noRel	I think it would be a good idea to ban commenters for some time, they should be issued with the reasons why their post is offensive at the same time	I agree with some other opinions on the use of A1 to flag or censor certain words that constitute hate or violent speech. It would also be beneficial to have a human supervisor from the organisation and another external body review the activities of the AI to ensure accuracy and consistency.
__label__noRel	I agree, but I don't know what the mechanism would be for linking comments to the actual people who made them.	An article proving AI can be helpful, but can struggle to interpret or detect certain things, suggesting manual reviewing is still very important. https://www.latrobe.edu.au/nest/can-combat-rise-online-hate-speech/ On another note, I also think anonymity plays a huge role in what people allow themselves to post online and think that certain platforms should consider only allowing people to comment under their own identity rather than online handles and such.
__label__noRel	It is definitely the way to go. We should not allow hate speech	I think with careful moderation, there's nothing wrong with keeping the comments section. Reddit is a fine example of extremely good moderation combined with bots that immediately remove content with insults and hatespeech.
__label__noRel	The only problem is that facts and hate can sometimes be intertwined together and a system cannot always distinguish it easily	Having a screaning for all comments before they go up on the platform to make sure that they are not posted on the site.

__label__noRel	I disagree, I think there is no difference on both platforms.	"Freedom of Speech'...that's a popular consensus among the masses, regardless of the "casualities" that are left on the wayside. Having reread a lot of the comments posted here, I do consider the possibility of having people comment as they wish, politically correct or not. HOWEVER, let there be consequences involved, such as naming and shaming, and acquring user details if need be, after all, things such as cyber crime, online harrassment, etc do exist, am I right? And so, if such a comment borders on this, let it become a criminal matter and have law enforcement dealing specifically in cyber-related crimes become involved. Problem solved.

__label__noRel	There needs to be a strict line between 'Free speech' and 'Hate speech'.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	Hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by educating people about the consequences of hate speech and what they can do to someone else.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Removing the comment facility in no way infringes free speech. The content providers, newspapers, are at liberty to provide discussion space or not as they see fit. The use of a moderator might be useful but this seems a great investment of time to little effect. There are obviously those who enjoy using comment spaces to express extreme and unthought out opinions as well as to insert hate speech. Perhaps only those who have subscribed to a news source should be allowed to comment.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	Ban those who consistent ly abuse hate speech
__label__noRel	Much as I agree that's probably ideal as far as not requiring constant monitoring of the sort that's only really feasible for a relatively small amount of newer articles, the kind of technology for properly filtering such things isn't quite there yet, beyond simply checking for specific language. ...and it's worth noting, even if it was, whoever writes the algorithm also decides what is worthy of being removed. Being able to cull commentary automatically this way is potentially even more damaging if your concern is freedom of speech.	A possible way to address hate speech on newspaper sites would be to incorporate both human moderators and some sort of AI that monitors for hateful words and comments. The requirement to submit personally identifying information before commenting might also help because without this then anyone can create a fake name that hides the person's true identity so therefore more likely to engage in hate speech. If personal information is required, then hate speech would be less likely.
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	By using moderators or AI to police the posts
__label__noRel	this can work if they have a filtering system to filter out the the hate speech comments	We can remove it fairly by making rules and monitoring the comment section.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	It is nice to think we could reduce hate speech.	by never posting the hate speech words in the newspaper
__label__noRel	this will encourage strives among the community	news media can look into AI technology to solve such problems.the machine will detect faul speeach and instantly hide or delete the comment ,then send a warning to the post writer
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	I believe the following article could provide more information on hate speech, not only in the context of this discussion but as a whole and what can be done to combat it. https://www.stompoutbullying.org/blog/hate-speech
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	Maybe online newspapers can invest in text mining, where if hate speech is detected, the comment will not go through. Or, in the comments section, there could be a greyed message in the background that states a non-tolerance to hate speech.
__label__noRel	Agreed with above. Comments are possible without being aggressive and it does allow people to talk about topical things.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	I believe that most people actually do realize the damage that hate speech can cause and are either deliberately using a platform to incite violence/harm/distress or just don't care as they dont see the people they are using hate speech against as being worth feeling for. There is enough research now to show the direct links between hate speech and hate crimes	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	it can be regulated	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	I think you are confusing hate speech with a controversial opinion. Hate speech would be saying a racist word 5 times; a controversial opinion would be that dinosaurs don't exist because of the square cube law.	hate speech revolves around certain words or slurs so if those word can be banned or even not allowed and the comment does not show up on the actual site it will help curb hate speech
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	I don't think newspapers, who have already seen their takings plummet in recent years due to everything moving online, will want to pay to employ moderators for their articles. They would need to have a pretty high number of mods in order to keep up as each newspaper carries so many articles. This topic is a massive minefield and I don't think there is a simple solution to it.
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	Debate is important	One cost-effective way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites while promoting reader comments is to outsource reader comments to social media. Comment sections can show comments for the article from social media platforms, while encouraging users to post comments onto these platforms. This way, hate speech can be reduced by social media platforms, which are more experienced with content moderation, have extensive rules in place, and have economies of scale with regard to content moderation compared to newspapers.
__label__noRel	I agree with this statement.	1st position: comments on newspaper articles should not be allowed
__label__noRel	Agreed.	Provide guidance on what is and isnt hate speech would work i think
__label__noRel	Removing hate speech is not the same as removing the ability for everyone to present their opinion : https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	I think that having these echo chambers just perpetuates what may be a cognitive dissonance, you may not necessarily feel a certain way but a comment you put out may have be interpreted one way and subsequent comments would reinforce that viewpoint in a polarised echo chamber. This website explains it nicely and uses racisms as an example of how cognitive dissonance perpetuates racist behaviour. https://www.reallifepsych.com/single-post/2017/08/16/the-psychology-of-cognitive-dissonance-and-racism	The comment section must be cut off
__label__noRel	yes it's true several articles show the effects that harassment on social networks can have on mental health	I believe the comment section should be open to all to express their opinions.We need freedom of speech. Hate speech can be ignored. But it is important to show the view of all.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	By moderating the comment section. Instead of having an individual who may be biased in their moderation, the use of an artificial intelligence software can be introduced to moderate the comment section.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	The newspapers should encourage the victims of hate speech to report hate speech published, establish monitoring and evaluation units in newsrooms. Some units should be tasked with monitoring hate speech trends, compiling reports and bringing these to the attention of key institutions
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	More emphasis on moderation of specific language would reduce the risk of hate speech. Also, moderators approving comments before they appear on the website would help.
__label__noRel	Agreed people may be highly less likely to post negative comments if they had their true identity in display!	Increasing the monitoring of comments made on a post will prevent the propagation of dangerous viewpoints and scams performed on people as no control over the content published create spaces for this to take place.
__label__noRel	if No more trolls, political copy-pastes, or general rudeness and anger are in comments i think both sides of arguement/opinion can be heard.	Younger people are susceptible to propaganda by the establishment "elites", they will be easy targets of manipulation by saying that ALL opposing views are "hate speech".
__label__noRel	Because pretending as if it's not happening doesnt mean it will stop when there is a disable comment.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	By ticking a box to agree not to be abusive or hateful before being allowed to comment
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	you cannot eliminate it. dont try. freedom of speech is importante and we must appreciae others have different view
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	I think everyone raised some good points already, but overall, it seems to be that some moderation is required no matter what, and that might be too costly for some smaller platforms to implement.
__label__noRel	Asking people to ignore it is not a solution	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I agree, there should be a policy on what is considered hate speech therefore making easy to censor hate speech	Develop a software that will not allow posting of any hate speech
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	A machine filtering comments would have a positive affect as then people still have the freedom of speech without the vulger and disrespectful language
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	I agree with this position since when providing personal data people would be less incentivized to starting hate speach
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	A pop-up can be used which reads "if any 'hate speech' comment is discovered, it will be removed from these comments".
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	1. Only allow verified accounts to post - these accounts should be easily traced back to individuals. 2. Moderate comments with both algorithms and human visibility. 3. Prosecute.
__label__noRel	there is always a need for opinions	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	I think there should a program that verify the comment before they are displayed on the newpaper
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	I think I would prefer to see that comments sections are removed rather than untruths being pushed at people.
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	Be more strict when allowing people to create profiles, that require identification before allowing anybody to comment. Stopping people being anonymous enough to feel confident while posting hate speech I think will be more beneficial than restricting peoples comments.
__label__noRel	true	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__noRel	It's a good idea, but too many get giddy at trying to break rules and in doing so, ruin things.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.

__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Addressing hate speech should not mean prohibiting freedom of speech which is what you will be doing if the comments' section is removed.

__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Just allow people to report bad comments and when it gets to a certain number it should delete the message and send an automatic email to the person who wrote it with a warning.

__label__noRel	I agree with Lawrence we can't give up on the notion that nothing can be, at first we might not get it right but with more options and exploring other things eventually there will be a solution that will prevent users with hate speech from participaating	It has been shown that comments sections are popular and do drive traffic to websites and make people spend more time on the site (so pleasing advertisers) So from a commercial/publishing point of view it would seem that some kind of moderation is the best way to deal with the problem and not eliminate the section altogether. (See https://webpublisherpro.com/your-website-needs-a-comments-section/)
__label__noRel	This would work well with non-bias moderators	Regulations of comment sections has been proven with various other platforms to be the best solution. When there are clear rules put in place regarding what should be considered as hate speech and the consequences of the part taking in such could lead to eg. A ban from the being able to comment for a certain period of time.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	Advanced AI is the ultimate answer. It is the cheapest and most unbiased moderator option.

I think one way of eliminating hate speech is to filter the comment section by certain words that are considered hateful.

__label__noRel	Again, good point. Maybe there should be a daily limit on how many posts can be removed?

__label__noRel	I agree that anybody being allowed to comment can give rise to fake news in comment sections	No-one should have to spend their time filtering out the disgusting things human beings are capable of saying about each other. Nobody has a right to comment on anything.
__label__noRel	Your post contains the argument, "Newspapers should cancel comment space because it can create... fake news." I don't think this is particularly convincing. By that logic, newspapers and news websites themselves should be cancelled since they will periodically create "fake news" - sometimes not due to malice but rather by an honest mistake [or journalist incompetence/ignorance]. Ben Goldacre, for example, runs (ran?) a blog called, "Bad Science" and a recurring motif was journalists failing to accurately depict scientific insights. We could argue that their exagerrations and mistranslations could be construed as "fake news" but there's no malice involved. The journalists weren't trying to deceive anyone. The solution to getting closer to an approximation of truth is not to remove an entire avenue of communication, but rather to open up (regulated) communication in the hopes that the arguments that are most cogent rises above the rest - and that the logical wheat be separated from the illogical chaff. That is to say, I think we need a better system than just, "let's get rid of the comment section." It's a tricky problem, no doubt, and a perfect solution may not exist. But we should not let "perfect" get in the way of, "good enough." In a subsequent post, I detail ONE possible method that incorporates several solutions previously mentioned (and as I write this post, I thought of ways to improve it further. Not perfect, but perhaps good enough).	we can reduce hate speech by blocking out certain words so that it can not be viewed publicly. and blocking the user using hate speech
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	It may be a good idea to involve some form of moderators to check if there are any hate speeches. Aggressive comments may be censored accordingly. However, we need to be careful in doing this as some may have negative effect as silencing voices.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	We can reduce hate speech by holding the owner of the platform accountable for hate speech being on their platform, this will force the platform owners to put strict systems in place to ensure this does not occur.
__label__noRel	we can't trust people to follow standards	have an admin or moderator remove inappropriate comments.
__label__noRel	I agree having an algorithm to delete specific words and phrases.	Education in media ethics: The first step in combating tribalized hate speech is realizing that, while the right to free expression is a fundamental human right, the rise of social media has produced a number of different channels for its creation, packaging, and transmission. The rights and liberties of journalists and their role in fostering and developing peaceful societies should be emphasized in media ethics education. The political, social, and cultural rights of individuals and groups, including the freedom of expression, must be made more widely known, as well as the obligations and societal repercussions that come with press freedom. Journalists need to have the knowledge and abilities to spot hate speech and disseminate anti-hate messaging.
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it.

I agree with some other opinions on the use of A1 to flag or censor certain words that constitute hate or violent speech. It would also be beneficial to have a human supervisor from the organisation and another external body review the activities of the AI to ensure accuracy and consistency.

__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	Completely doing away with the comment section would not be beneficial to the readers experience as reading other peoples thoughts is what sets online media apart from offline media. It plays a role in keeping the discussion going. It would be smart to rather monitor comments to ensure hate speech or utterances of a vile nature are greatly reduced through the use of some sort of algorithm that picks up on problematic words and deletes comments or it being done manually by people who will moderate the comment section.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	I totally agree that hate speech should be limited as some readers do not take it lightly and may harm themselves after reading. I have heard stories about people ending their lives after their stories which often are embarassing are published, and the situation made worse by the comment section.
__label__noRel	freedom of speech needs to be maintained whilst making sure other people's rights are not violated and people do not have to read 'hate speech' which is offensive to them personally,	I don't believe removing the comment section will help remove hate speech, but having a system that can track the device and the people that use that device can go a long way in removing trolls from a community platform and prevent them from becoming repeat offenders.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it.

__label__noRel	i suppose that for those who do listen and pay attention that this is a good idea as it allows for the idea of freedom of speech aslong as everyone knows what they are saying and how it can effect people	This is an interesting point - I wonder if some websites already use AI to moderate user comments and posts. I think AI could be trained to recognise hate speech, although it would have to be tested first as it could censor too much.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it.

The problem stems from how to stop this from happening.
__label__noRel	Hate comments can manifest into something much worse and is absolutely neccesary to destroy the source of the hate.	Awareness campaigns need to be implemented to teach people about the significance of avoiding hate speech.
__label__noRel	Hate speech is a nonsense concept.	create an algorithm that identifies hate speech and removes it
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	I'm of the supporting view that the use of AI to filter out Hate speech could prove to be very useful
__label__noRel	removing the comment section will drive traffic away and decrease the amount of time readers engage with the newspaper.	Well..hate speech is a problem then there is freedom of speech as well. There is a possibility a writer is giving valid points.
__label__noRel	Reducing freedom of speech is never good and using an algorithm can be helpful, however it opens a whole group of structural problems, when not all hate speech is treated equally. https://time.com/5739688/facebook-hate-speech-languages/	The only possible way to reduce hate speech is to have some kind of algorithm that may recognise certain words and phrases. Other than that it would mean moderating the comment section.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	Newspapers should remember they is freedom of speech	People will always spew hate speech and regulating it may be difficult to do. Freedom of speech should prevail therefore eliminating the comments section would be wrong. The newspaper site may have an automation that identifies hate words and whenever these appear the comment should be hidden from the comments section.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	i agree that removing comments about hate speech is not the way to go
__label__noRel	I think adding chat bans for repeat offenders of hate speech could help.	I think using a platform which blocks out certain words, kind of like a filter would help. So if someone made a post with a certain word in, that post would not be made public, instead the comment would be flagged and go to a admin, who can read the comment and then decide if the 'bot' which flagged it was correct or not, and then deciding if to allow the post to be made or not
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	Counting on peoples's good behavior does not work. (https://www.washingtonpost.com/discussions/2020/04/13/community-rules/)
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	Comment sections need to be well-moderated, and if algoritmic or user comment flagging is used this needs to also be reviewed by a human moderator to ensure that there is no bias or bad faith reporting going on.
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	Research has shown that hate speech can be effectively controled since freedom of speech is not absolute
__label__noRel	This sums up how detrimental hate speech could be	Hate speech is not free speech. It must be banned
__label__noRel	information	Online comment spaces should be platforms promoting free speech, with some restrictions in place. Human or digital moderators (AI) could be used to identify comments and phrases constituting hate speech and remove them from the platform without hindering people's ability to share their authentic views.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	I don't think it's fair to eliminate comments from newspaper articles because the public is entitled to have their opinions heard. The best way to deal with hate speech is to moderate each comment before it is posted. Also the newspaper could ban accounts who engage in hate speech in the comments section. This moderation could be done through both human moderators and software to find trigger words signifying hate speech. It's important to democracy that citizens can have their say on the issues that affect their lives.
__label__noRel	The drawback here is that people get carried away and be verbally aggressive and use foul language which doesn't go well with most of the readers who come to view the news and some of the healthy discussions in the comment section. But, all they find it few people engaging in a verbal war which is uncalled for.	A moderated comments section can solve this problem. Freedom of speech does not need to include hate speech. An opinion can be given that doesn't include hate speech in it.
__label__noRel	Agree with some of this. Hate speech is just a fake concept to avoid certain discussions	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	Not so much swearing and negativity.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	I totally agree. There are people who like to read comments. It is also a right to express an opinion.	they need to as often it is minorities which are affected
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	They are a business and therefore hold the control over what is said in their comments.	The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is often used as a reason not to have readers comments. It seems that this is not a fair argument for eliminating readers comments because of the psychological phenomenon of "cognitive dissonance" - we automatically search for echo chambers in any context.
__label__noRel	I also agree with this position. letting people fully express themselves will fully enable sourcing The root of the problem	Commenters should agree to abide by all rules when signing up to the website and he banned for breaking the rules. Also all submitted comments must be thoroughly checked for negative for flagged words or topics. Also I think it would reduce the chances of this happening if users could not reply to each other or comment on others opinions. It's about each users initial opinion on a certain subject and less about judging others opinions on what they think!!!!
__label__noRel	Newspapers should ensure comments are without any form of hate speech to encourage different opinions to be shared.	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	I agree, feelings should be left out when giving your views.	Allow others users to rate the comments and block those who receive bad ratings
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	it needs good moderating to weed out anything that could be described as hate speech
__label__noRel	There is no place for hate speech in today's society for hate speech. It is harmful and in some cases, illegal.	Hate speech is everywhere, not just in the newspaper
__label__noRel	I agree	I know this has been discussed a few times potentially in reply to comments but I'd like to repeat it again: language is complex and you can't simply ban or flag certain terms or phrases and think you catch all the hate speech comments etc. While a report button and the use of a software that can support a human moderator is in essence a good idea, it might also delete comments that do not actually contain HS or completely miss others overall. I think this decision by the newspaper turned into an entire discussion of manageability of monitoring discussion sections and away from the ethical considerations.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	people should have values and respect for others.Just like facebook written words are monitored and people already know these rules.A set of rules should be set
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	Our freedom to do anything as part of a society is limited. Thus freedom of speech should be no different. Poeple need to be held accountable for their mistakes, so everybody else's rights will be protected. So having a set of keywords which are not allowed to be used is a way of reminding the writter that using the offensive word he/she is trying to use is considered a crime. An additional way to handle that is having the flag option by users and a team of moderators who follow a standard and will verify if flagged comments should be maintained or not. Lastly, anonymity might bring a feeling of impunity and even its possibility, so a way to avoid that is allowing one profile per person/email, where a fake username can be set, but, in the backstage, the website will know who it is that wrote each comment.
__label__noRel	someone that works for the newspapers or websites?	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	using key words and having moderators might help
__label__noRel	The following article is supporting that https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2116310118	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	By moderating the comment section. Instead of having an individual who may be biased in their moderation, the use of an artificial intelligence software can be introduced to moderate the comment section.
__label__noRel	It can mean different things to different people, but there are also laws referring to hate speech which define it, albeit not always very clearly	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	Sadly not everyone can be polite enough to express themselves without the use of hate speech, hence such people should be blocked as we cannot tolerate it.	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	I agree	by checking what people comment befor approval
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	It will definetly help to reduce hate speech from the readers as no one will be able to comment	Removing the comment section all together is a fair point as news is meant to be fair and impartial. People share their opinions based on their biases and that's not what the news is for - that's what social media is for. But in this case allowing the comment section to remain would be great if people would not abuse the power to share freely by sharing hate speech and slander. us as humans need to be regulated by a set of rules in order to keep a functioning society and i think a filtered comment section is the solution.
__label__noRel	Yes, I totally agree with this. Actually, I think this might be the solution to this problem. If comments are moderated before they go public then there is no chance that offensive and inappropriate comments will make it to the public comments section.	Space on comments is a must have because many users get to participate into a good course that could help many others and therefore those spewing hate should be harshly dealt with. Blocked actively so
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	The following article is supporting that https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2116310118	In the digital world we live in - unfortunately hate speech is part and parcel of the benefits of having such an open forum and allowing everyone to have a voice. Hate speech is made by a minuscule minority of people. Perhaps have a 'report hate speech' button that members of the community can use.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	Evidence from research (see attached) suggests that the comments section of a news article is better at creating discussion than outside sources, so comment sections in newspapers is important for nuanced discussion	By implimenting a system that can filter out all comments before the comments are added to the website or newspaper for the readers to read
__label__noRel	I like this idea - there could also be a warning system for those reading the comments, if something does get published that possibly shouldn't have. A warning stating that the following comment may be offensive and contain hate speech.	One mainstream way of mitigating hate speech on online comment sections is to pre-moderate comments. This however may lead to a 'biased' viewpoint. A lighter example of this could be how some youtubers delete constructive criticism.
__label__noRel	Maybe it's better to know what someone is thinking, good or bad	Whatever the decision may be, the law and freedom of speech needs to be considered
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Short answer is you can't, as the term 'hate speech' is incredibly vague, and can differ from person to person.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	I am unsure if there is a way to reduce hate speech. One persons 'hate speech' is anothers 'freedom of speech'. As a supposedly democratic nation, we need to be able to permit people from all walks of lives and experiences to air their own personal views, whether these are educated views or not.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	some people "troll" by writing inflammatory remarks, but it is fundamental to a free society to have free discussion. Any attempts at calling something "hate speech" will be only about stopping anything that goes against the narratives of the rich establishment.
__label__noRel	Education = respect	allow people to say what they feel
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	lack of freedom of speech	I agree with most of the commenters here, there needs to be moderation. Even if you don't agree with the arguments there are ways of saying it that do not fall into 'hate speech'.
__label__noRel	I agree. Users should be able to to flag harmful comments and report them to a moderator. Users can also counteract damaging comments by refuting the content of the comment, for example, by refering to reliable sources	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	I agree, we cannot compromise free speech, we need to find a way to allow free speech whilst targeting the removal of hate speech	The question is? Is hate speech not part of free speech? I think people should be left to express themselves however they feel is appropriate as long as they are not breaking an laws
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	Readers should not be given a false assumption on the understandings of others.
__label__noRel	doesn't discuss free speech - cant limiting free speech lead to hate crimes	We do have to allow people to express their opinions - we can't pretend opinions don't exist. Having them out in the open lets us know what we're dealing with. But at the same time hate speech can't be allowed to flourish and absolutely needs to be challenged. There is a role for AI (which I have said before I know) to try and weed out and remove anything that is just pure hate and not any sort of coherent argument or opinion.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	should be open to all
__label__noRel	While I agree, there are many ways in which these auto-moderation technologies can be bypassed. https://newmediaservices.com.au/9-ways-to-bypass-auto-moderation/	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	On heavily discussed topics, there may be too many comments to properly moderate. The burden may be too high to manually do this.	I don't think this is possible. We should go back to physical printed newspapers.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	It must me a government's responsibility to implement policies against hate speech.https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-to-combat-fake-news-and-disinformation/
__label__noRel	It is the way to go. Hate speech should not be allowed a space in society	people who comment hate speech should be banned
__label__noRel	Censorship can go too far if the power is in the wrong hands. https://youtu.be/YyMGO2MO6GU	I was completely taken aback by some strong stances to remove the comment space, and the belief in that because Newspapers should be one-sided providers. I would disagree because newspaper share societal information and society should be allowed to engage and be part of the conversation instead of just consuming whatever information is being released for consumption. It has been seen as a result of other newspaper websites removing the comment section that it reduces the trust of the reader because they are aware of the bias of the information they are consuming, and also it reduces the amount of time readers spend on these sites because there is no community engagements.

__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	Ultimately the comments are needed to gather feedback in certain situations, removing the comments section wouldn't help us eliminate hate speech because where information needs to be gathered, no blacklist will help.
__label__noRel	I think this is a good idea, I would start with education, if that is not helping then restricting the person from commenting.	The comment section must be cut off

__label__noRel	agreed, but sometimes trolls know full well the damage they do so there is a subset of people that it is impossible to have fair discussion with because they only want to provoke negative reactions	Completely removing the comment section is out of the question. How else is the audience supposed to interact with the material and each other? the feedback could be useful to the writer too for future articles pertaining to similar topics.
__label__noRel	I agree	block swearing, abusive, discrimatory words- freedom of speech without rasicism, name calling etc
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	I think that education is the way to go about it, Humans must respect opposing views of others and tolerant society should be encouraged at all times instead of censorship
__label__noRel	I do agree that comments shouldn't be closed.	Hate speech online absolutely must be eliminated and we should not encourage it within online platforms. Hate speech can and does lead to violence which is more severe than 'being horrible online'. https://www.coe.int/web/european-commission-against-racism-and-intolerance/hate-speech-and-violence
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	Having read through the opinions of others, my stance has not completely changed. It is important to censor comments, freedom of speech does not always equate to disrespecting the views and opinions of others. While I agree that comments should be censored, I do not agree that every comment should be removed. As mentioned before, a system can be implemented that removes comments with certain words, thus making the comment section a safe space for all who use it.
__label__noRel	Could you elaborate?	Freedom of speech is important - however hate speech is not important to debate
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	I dont think it is a fair choice. For how long should people be silenced. Hate speech is always going to be around. Shutting people up is not going to stop hate speech.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	read though the comments and only put on the comments with the less hate speech on
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	(sorry I mean one in ten)	There needs to be rules and regulations stating the type of comments that can be made about other people. There should also be verification of a persons identity everytime they make a comment so that is visible who the statement was made by. Newspaper articles should constantly ready and delete hate speech comment.
__label__noRel	This is correct, as blocking free speech altogether leads us into a very different type of society. It is a tricky dilemma, how to allow free speech but prevent hate speech, but one that does need attention and ideas	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	By monitoring the comments, it will make decent people to enjoy the platform and it will make the website respectful	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	Removing the comment space from online newspapers is definitely not fair but I believe that it should be regulated by A-I. This way readers could share different opinions and thoughts abut the topic at hand without offending one another.
__label__noRel	Guidelines could be very useful to set up rules for what is and isn't allowed on the website. Then, everyone has a clear understanding of the moderator's goals and reasonings.	One way I propose to prevent hate speech is to remove anonymity online. Not being able to hide should limit cowardly behavior and thus reduce harmful speech.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	I think there should at least be a 'report' button and any hate speech reported should be removed.
__label__noRel	not focusing on the interconnection between free speech and hate crime	By introducing a cyber bullying detecting software
__label__noRel	I think this is true and there is no need for spiteful comments to be made and ruin someone's day.	Some hate speech is actually illegal, so that should definitely be reported and removed. https://www.report-it.org.uk/reporting_internet_hate_crime
__label__noRel	This could provoke some people to actually post hate speech hoping it will be read by some before it's removed?	You have to log on to write a comment, having character/post limits, comments must be verified by someone who checks for hate speech before approving the comment for publication
__label__noRel	The reason why I disagree is because removing the comment sections unable readers from expressing their view and opinions on certain topics covered in the newspaper.	More control by moderators plus a code of conduct for users
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	I don't want to see the comments space removed as it amounts to censorship. I'd much rather that people saw what other people thought and were able to consider it. Hopefully, readers will recognise when some people are irrational and will not add fuel to the fire. Good moderators would help but they mustn't be trigger happy. They must allow dissent and only remove what it clearly offensive.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	There will always be a few bad apples in a batch just as there will always be bad people among humanity. Honestly the easiest method of combatting this issue is through the utilization of manual review teams perhaps hired by the newspaper or even paid through revenue made by the articles failing that approach bots can be instantiated with the programmed capability of removing comments that have flagged contents inside them.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	We need a more thick skin with some of our debate topics if we want to win arguements against "hate"
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Allow users to report comments.
__label__noRel	Some people with genuine or kind comments may be put off interacting	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__noRel	Exactly the newspapers must be the place to comment because they give us the article but this article is written by a journalist. Therefore, the article represent the ideas of the journalist. Not all the time they are neutral. Sometimes they are even politically influenced. This often provokes discussions and where else can people say their opinion if there is no comment section?	we could filter the comments and have a panel to decide
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	People should be told about hate speech and how it affects other people and I think people who participate in hate speech should have some sort of panishment.
__label__noRel	How is this going to stop trolls that create multiple accounts so that if they are blocked they just do it from another faceless account consequences.l	Having a screaning for all comments before they go up on the platform to make sure that they are not posted on the site.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	In as much as we can not let the spread of hate speech continue, closing the comment section is not the solution. The newspaper website should have the option for readers to be able to report comments that include hate speech and moderators should be appointed to check "users" that are violating the rules. There can be filters in place that remove posts that have some of the common hateful and derogatory phrases. outlining the rules and regulations for the website users can help
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	I'm a firm supporter of freedom of speech but the internet as we all know can be a cruel place. A lot of individuals hide behind their screens and say things to people that they wouldn't have the guts to say in person given the opportunity. So with that being said I stand for the elimination of the space bar for readers.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.

__label__noRel	It can be useful for readers to see readers comments as they may present another interesting opinion or be informative in some way.	You can moderate and that way delete hate speech.

__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Hire moderators and similar positions, and also having filtering systems
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	I think by blocking certain terms that are hateful when responding to others in comments i.e., you are an idiot, loser etc. Hate speech should not be present online.
__label__noRel	but what if users arent using their real information, how can the goverment implement it then?	More control by moderators plus a code of conduct for users
__label__noRel	I agree with moderation and the need for education and increased open-mindedness and respect	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	Moderating comments sections is a lot of work to do manually, the individuals tasked with it would burn out in short time trying to manage that effectively while also having to read hateful garbage all day. If there was a system to remove hate speech it needs to be automated with an algorithm that catches certain words, then reviewed manually when someone disagrees with the content removed and it not being against guidelines. We use guidelines for everything including media regulations for accurate reporting or having to retract when information is not accurate. It's no different in the comments section, it doesn't remove free speech it regulates it to create a healthy environment to have a conversation in. Over moderation can have as severe of an effect as under, it has to be a system that takes in common complaints from both sides. Not the hate speech side per say but the sides of people who are pro free flowing conversation and those who want more shielding to avoid extremist echo chambers.

__label__noRel	True but sometimes the media can provide false information	Completely doing away with the comment section would not be beneficial to the readers experience as reading other peoples thoughts is what sets online media apart from offline media. It plays a role in keeping the discussion going. It would be smart to rather monitor comments to ensure hate speech or utterances of a vile nature are greatly reduced through the use of some sort of algorithm that picks up on problematic words and deletes comments or it being done manually by people who will moderate the comment section.

__label__noRel	Don't think we should be censoring people	It is important that people are able to have a voice, especially as it can be a great tool in educating people, and giving people a variety of viewpoints that they wouldn't necessarily get to often hear. Sometimes we learn best by hearing and understanding the views of other people. We don't have to necessarily change our opinions, but it can help us become more aware of why or how people feel a certain way about things.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	People should be allowed to say what they want. Other people can disagree - they should not allow themselves to be angered by opinions with which they disagree.
__label__noRel	I don't agree with removing the space for views to be aired. That is an important part of challenging and changing opinion. I agree that hate speech should not be tolerated so finding the users and punishing them is key.	Advanced AI is the ultimate answer. It is the cheapest and most unbiased moderator option.
__label__noRel	I agree, everyone has freedom of speech but no should abuse it and use it using hate speech. Everybody should respect everyone's idea/opinion.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	Is it necessary to have readers comments? What do they add to the article?
__label__noRel	that is actually true positive criticism	Some people just like to spread their negative vibes on strangers, not worried about serious consequences, as the worst thing that can happen to them is the comment being removed. There should be consequences!
__label__noRel	This is one of the most sane posts in this discussion. Thank you.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	I'm a firm believer of freedom of speech therefore eliminating it in any form especially because of something that can be regulated like hate speech, to me is ridiculous.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	regardless of the nuance in hate speech, a platform can still manage it effectively using the laid out definitions but also can fill some of the gap by having a wider language policy that also includes the use of threatening and aggressive language	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	The words chosen to be used are very essential when in comes to the reader and a writer. The content that is viewed as a hate speech should not be shown to the other readers. It should automatically give a warning to the writer and after 3 warnings they should be blocked as they do not comply with the terms and conditions.
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	Removing the comment section will only create a bigger revolt and uprise from people that write hate speech, and it will move to another media outlets. So the problem should be treated not silenced it. It is the responsibility of newspapers websites to police hate speech in order to create a safe environment for an healthy discussion about a news article. Otherwise you are cutting short an experience that users might want to have. So by censoring all the comment section your make erverybody pay a price for something that they haven't done. Moderation is the key and should be done my the newspapers websites according to the values they have.
__label__noRel	i agree with this, there are boundaries	Removing the comment section from online newspapers is not the answer. Allowing people to post their opinions is healthy and a normal part of human society- people will not always agree. However, in order to reduce hate speech, which can so often lead to crime, it could be done so that there are monitors (either human or computer) who check comments before they are posted to ensure they are not hate speech.
__label__noRel	Other comments can also make other people sad	The pros of removing comment sections would be to eradicate the spreadof hate speech. Certain individuals thrive on adding fuel to fire. In this case having the comment section deleted would be a positive thing. On the other hand only by having differing opinions can discussions and debates happen. So if someone spews hate speech only then can we see the extent to which someone disagrees with a certain group/viewpoint etc. https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea
__label__noRel	may stop people being 'keyboard warriors' and hiding behind a screen	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	Unfortunately,others might say it is censorship	By having an algorithm that detects and deletes any hate speech comment.
__label__noRel	Great! I have a similar approach	Ensuring there are rules to adhere to, perhaps muting certain offensive words or phrases. Making sure commnect sections are heavily monitored.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	we need to stop coment section
__label__noRel	IT is absoluety the websites job to police polirising comments if nesccearry to keep peace wihthin the outiside community viewing their newspapers.	The comments section may be removed on especially conflicting topics/conversations.
__label__noRel	I don't think there are any	hate speech is a reflection of two sides of a story ,all side of the story need to be published to allow the public to make up their own minds .
__label__noRel	i agree, its nice to see different opinions on different subject, different perspectives from community.	I'd happily see all comments sections removed for the good of the public in general. Nobody needs to know that Tony from Bognor thinks All Them Lot Should Go Home, because Tony is a twat who shouldn't be given a platform.
__label__noRel	there would have to be agreement across all platforms regarding which words were filtered out. It is possible that a simple computer algorithm might let through an offensive word where a letter has been replaced by a number and filter out inoffensive words by taking them out of context.	Is it really hate speech or is it just an opinion that we don't want to hear?
__label__noRel	Crowdsource moderation is a great idea, similar to reddit where people can vote, but there are still moderators who can remove posts completely if they break sub rules	newspaper might remove comment section as a way to prevent hate speech. however, it does remove freedom of speech to those who would like to express themselves through comment section.
__label__noRel	Newspapers often weave opinion in to their presentation of the news, they don't always report just in a purely factual manner. No comment sections at all would stifle discussion.	There needs to be rules and regulations stating the type of comments that can be made about other people. There should also be verification of a persons identity everytime they make a comment so that is visible who the statement was made by. Newspaper articles should constantly ready and delete hate speech comment.
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__noRel	People who are spreading hate speech usually won't care for being educated	I'm of the supporting view that the use of AI to filter out Hate speech could prove to be very useful
__label__noRel	newspapers are biased - they don't reflect balanced opinions	The best way to reduce hate speech would be to make sure that moderators are present to check on comments, it would not be advisable to cancel comments completely due the feedback it gives and people will always have their opinions and sometimes they will involve hate speech, which is unavoidable...
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	The idea that media should be able to stop a conversation is wrong and this is what would happen if comments were removed.
__label__noRel	Perhaps but a well defined policy by the newspaper should be able to indicate what is and is not allowed	I think removing the comment space is just avoiding the problem. There can be interesting and thoughtful comments and we would miss from them. Newspapers websites should instead try to regulate the comment space by introducing a bot or hiring appropriate moderators or there should be some punishment to discourage the use of hate speech.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	A moderated comments section can solve this problem. Freedom of speech does not need to include hate speech. An opinion can be given that doesn't include hate speech in it.
__label__noRel	Eliminating the space for reader comments would be violating free speech, in my opinion it would be much better to have every incident recorded as a Non-crime hate incident'. The government needs to have stricter and clearer laws on what entails hate crime and hate incidents.	AI could be used to flag hate speech, meaning comments that are hate speech can be flagged at the time.

__label__noRel	True, but not every criticism is valid	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	Yes it is not a solution because people will no longer discuss the contents of the article, we should keep the comment section open	By using a tool to search for hate speech
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	Hate speech must be banned totally from the online publications.

__label__noRel	that is actually true positive criticism	Many people are against the reducing of hate speech from newspaper article, and I am with them on this. The main reason for putting comment section on newspaper websites was for readers to leave a comment, people will always have something to say whether it is good or bad.

__label__noRel	I completely agree!	This project takes the approach of counterspeech, whereby hateful comments are not removed, but instead responded to with alternative, police and non-aggressive comments. https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/counterspeech-better-way-tackling-online-hate
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	Newspaper websites should also be held accountable if they do not deal with hate speech
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Removing the comment facility in no way infringes free speech. The content providers, newspapers, are at liberty to provide discussion space or not as they see fit. The use of a moderator might be useful but this seems a great investment of time to little effect. There are obviously those who enjoy using comment spaces to express extreme and unthought out opinions as well as to insert hate speech. Perhaps only those who have subscribed to a news source should be allowed to comment.

__label__noRel	true, but maybe they can remove anonymity so that everyone can be accountable for what they say.	most people seem to be of the opinion that cutting comments altogether is not constructive.

__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	I agree with the notion that being able to share our thoughts and feelings is a right and having people share their views can help people to question their own thoughts. The inclusion of moderators to prevent people from posting discriminatory or harmful comments would be good, but difficult to ensure these moderators aren't biased towards one argument

Despite my defence of human moderators, it seems they too are flawed -- check out this article https://www.technologynetworks.com/informatics/news/ai-trusted-as-much-as-humans-to-flag-hate-speech-365777 -- human moderators are not only prone to bias but also impractical. With the huge wealth of content posted every second online, it is unrealistic to expect humans to be able to view, criticise, and moderate every single comment.
__label__noRel	The problem is can an algorithm actually make the full determination of what is hateful and not? It may have the same biases.	exclude certain words from being posted

__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Flag up hate comments.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	I definately think the way forward is to have moderators that will review all comments before they get posted.They can then approve or disapprove all the comments and flag inappropiate user names.

They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	readers comments be moderated and anything that is harmful, hateful or hurtful should be removed. this allows people to exercise their right of freedom of speech but limiting the harm that someones opinion may have
__label__noRel	Statement made with knowledge	read though the comments and only put on the comments with the less hate speech on
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	I think I would prefer to see that comments sections are removed rather than untruths being pushed at people.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	Newspaper websites can have an option where other people could report the hate speech comment.
__label__noRel	I don't think "ineffective" is right word to use, I think 80% of the suggestions would somehow have an effect on this because it it a measure after all, it may not completely address or eliminate hate speech but it will have an effect.	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	We can fairly reduce hate speech from newspapers websites without eliminating space for readers comments by encouraging people to give a reward who will comment without hate speech.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	Overall I think I agree with some of the mentions that removing the comments section does reduce freedom of speech. We should be allowed to comment and share opinions on any topic as long as it isn't hate speech.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	We need a more thick skin with some of our debate topics if we want to win arguements against "hate"
__label__noRel	I disagree people need to show what they think about what has been written	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	that's why I think is important for readers to have a limit on what to say	I think comments should be limited and all negative comments should be blocked
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	The only way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites is letting the readers know that if they comment with negative words on the comment section they will be blocked
__label__noRel	I don't agree with arguments that removing comment sections is an attack on free speech. People have multiple platforms where they can give their opinions (social media, emails, forums, conversations etc.). Newspapers aren't required to provide yet another place for people to converse.	Someone should monitor the chat, and those who use hate speech should be given 1 warning before being removed from the website.
__label__noRel	How do you propose to address the root causes?	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	block swearing, abusive, discrimatory words- freedom of speech without rasicism, name calling etc
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	moderating the comments would surely help
__label__noRel	People want to comment about what they've just read on the newspaper, they don't want to go to an external source to talk about it. Why would it be any better sending people elsewhere to do this? There must be a way to educate people as a way to prevent hate speech.	Having certain words being banned or marked as inappropriate might help reduce hate speech. Systems that moderate what is being said and shared and the option to report hate speech might be helpful.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	This solves one problem - no one can then be offended	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	By moderating the comment section. Instead of having an individual who may be biased in their moderation, the use of an artificial intelligence software can be introduced to moderate the comment section.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal	I think that education with penalties such as exclusion from the community for repeated offences is the best policy. Like many I agree that some people are unaware they unaware they have caused offence to others.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__noRel	Opinions can damaging and should not always be shared	Hate speech poses grave dangers for the cohesion of a democratic society. It can lead to acts of violence and conflict on a wider scale.
__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	Research has shown that hate speech can be effectively controled since freedom of speech is not absolute
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	As much as I would *like to* agree, I unfortunately cannot. Free speech still IS a part of free speech. I'm afraid you can't have one or the other - they are co-dependent as I believe, humans are inherently seeking conflict.	I do not think it is possible, in a fair and just way. When speech is restricted that's called censorship. Who would justify the restrictive opinion?
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	Hate speech is an attack, a threat, or prehudice speech.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	realistically hate speech cannot be eliminated but preventative measures cane be put in place to minimise its presence
__label__noRel	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours	Strict content moderation
__label__noRel	I completely agree as people will just go elsewhere and make it much more worse.	I think that definition of hatespeech needs to be laid out clearly as I think different people have different ideas on what constitutes hatespeech - perhaps if there was a kind of premediation that informs the user that what they are engaging in qualifies as hatespeech it may make them more likely to reconsider their messages introducing a form of self moderation as well as external moderation
__label__noRel	But have you considered which one has more serious effects and consequences? I think that should be guiding in the main argument on whether to allow commenting or allow hate speech	It is easy to be hateful online when you are anonymous. Before being able to comment on newspaper websites, users should be required to sign up using traceable methods (eg. some form of identification). The comment section should regularly be monitored and any users who post hate speech should face serious consiquences
__label__noRel	no engage from the readers	I don't believe removing the comment section will help remove hate speech, but having a system that can track the device and the people that use that device can go a long way in removing trolls from a community platform and prevent them from becoming repeat offenders.
__label__noRel	newspapers are meant to inform, not to be discussed. The comment section is not necessary.	We can remove it fairly by making rules and monitoring the comment section.
__label__noRel	If such a thing can be created then it could work well	The best solution would be one that elegantly ties the reduction of hate speech in the comment section with no detrimental effect to the publics freedom of speech. This could be done by setting guidelines for hate speech, and also ensuring that the public provides identifying information such as their email address and especially their phone number. Both can be tracked to the person. To take it even further would be to be able to collect data such as ip addresses( with the commenters permission of course) when the person sends their comment so as to be able hold them accountable for any hate speech they send in. This will prevent people from using such language and hoping to hide under anonymity.

__label__noRel	i agree, this would be useful as it can keep other comments	I kind of agree, but I think that organisations have a responsibility to put something in place to monitor their comment sections. Even if it's not an algorithm and it's an actual person instead! Although your link shows how difficult this would be for a huge organisation like FB.
__label__noRel	I actually agree that eliminating the space for conversation on polarizing topics can reduce extremist echo chambers sometimes. Though they often move to other platforms that have zero regulations to hold that conversation when they can't have it where they saw something. Which increases the odds of being stuck in a hateful echo chamber.	People will always spew hate speech and regulating it may be difficult to do. Freedom of speech should prevail therefore eliminating the comments section would be wrong. The newspaper site may have an automation that identifies hate words and whenever these appear the comment should be hidden from the comments section.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	I agree that moderating the comment section with flagged phrases that automatically send comments for quick moeration would be a good solution.
__label__noRel	Some would argue it removes their right of freedom of speech. Despite whether it is of hateful intent or not.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Is it really hate speech or is it just an opinion that we don't want to hear?

__label__noRel	A very good point. So-called hate speech is often used by leftists to silence political opponents.	Short answer is you can't, as the term 'hate speech' is incredibly vague, and can differ from person to person.

__label__noRel	I totally agree. Freedom of speech is very important, but if it goes too far and it becomes online harassment, then it's time to treat it as a criminal offence.	Agreed
__label__noRel	agree with this! Lack of education is often the biggest culprits when it comes to hate speech - many people are scared of things they don't know about.

The pros of removing comment sections would be to eradicate the spreadof hate speech. Certain individuals thrive on adding fuel to fire.

__label__noRel	But people who engage in hate speech probably wouldn't take any notice.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	This would reduce the risk of hate speech.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	agree	Despite our general right to freedom of speech, hate speech remains inextricably linked to hate crimes and intolerance. A hard stance should be taken by newspapers against hate speech, utilising moderators to remove hateful comments, despite the fact that it could be construed as a restriction on free speech.
__label__noRel	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.	Removing the comment section will not solve the problem. It will just create a filling of censorship and will make debate and dialogue vanish. It is important that people discuss news topics and also give feedback on those news to the newspaper. It is important to moderate this comments in a strict no hate speech way and bring accountability in. Eliminating comments will just hide a problem that needs to be fixed by moderating and educating people.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can cause unnecessary harm and the removal of a space for readers comments would overall be a good thing that would not take away from the experience of reading the articles.	I think there should be red flagged or blacklisted words that shouldn't be allowed to be used in reader's comments.

__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes.

__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	I believe comment sections should be moderated more to prevent the obvious hate speech and statements that do not add anything useful to the discussion
__label__noRel	Exactly. People want to feel as if they are part of the conversation. Removing the comment section just has the opposite effect.	appreciate people have different views
__label__noRel	Yes, I agree 100% with this as the impacts of hate speech and cyberbullying can be detrimental to the person. https://www.youthranch.org/blog/social-media-dangers-and-the-effects-of-cyberbullying	I think that keeping an open space for discussion is vital and needed. Strick and easy to understand rules should be there and a group of moderators implementing them as well.

There will always be a few bad apples in a batch just as there will always be bad people among humanity.

__label__noRel	it is important for media to be criticised in order to validate it we do not have to accept what is written	Removing hate speech comments is also not a good thing because with the technology that we have, people will go and create fake accounts and still go back to comment hatefully and disrespecting words of which it will be a daunting task to delete all the comments
__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted.

__label__noRel	This is frequently used in social media platforms now, but it can be quite time consuming. Also the tone of a statement can be misinterpreting in text format.	Removing the comment section should not be an option, we should not lose the right to freedom of speech based on the likelihood that a few may post hateful comments, strict moderation and being able to report hate speech is the solution. Having people sign up for platforms and use ID to which they could be held personally accountable is an option as well. Hate Speech often comes from being able to hide behind a keyboard, screen and a fake username.

__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Removing the comment section all together is a fair point as news is meant to be fair and impartial. People share their opinions based on their biases and that's not what the news is for - that's what social media is for. But in this case allowing the comment section to remain would be great if people would not abuse the power to share freely by sharing hate speech and slander. us as humans need to be regulated by a set of rules in order to keep a functioning society and i think a filtered comment section is the solution.
__label__noRel	this literally achieves nothing	Moderating comments could be a viable solution. The use of AI could make it easier given that there could be thousands and thousands of comments, too much for human moderator/s to keep track of.
__label__noRel	In many ways, the debates confronting courts, legislatures, and publics about how to reconcile the competing values of free expression and nondiscrimination have been around for a century or longer. Democracies have varied in their philosophical approaches to these questions, as rapidly changing communications technologies have raised technical challenges of monitoring and responding to incitement and dangerous disinformation. United States. Social media platforms have broad latitude [PDF], each establishing its own standards for content and methods of enforcement. Their broad discretion stems from the Communications Decency Act. The 1996 law exempts tech platforms from liability for actionable speech by their users. Magazines and television networks, for example, can be sued for publishing defamatory information they know to be false; social media platforms cannot be found similarly liable for content they host.	Removing the comment section will not be effective since there will not be any interactions between readers.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	Although it might be unfair for others, I think majority can agree that removing the comment section will be helpful because then it means anyone that has an opinion can rather call the newspaper.

__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__noRel	I agree with you on the fact the media controlling what we view can be untrustworthy and outright terrifying, however in the view of hate speech and affecting the health of authors and committed readers mentally factors in more greatly than this, in my personal opinion.	If the aim is merely to reduce hate speech then I think eradicating the comment section goes too far. Why should people not be allowed to comment and have their say. The newspaper is punishing the public for the crimes of a few. It seems rather unfair. I think the best method is to have monitors.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites may remove comment areas if they wish. Having moderators or allowing only subscribed comments are also options that may work. They just have to be careful on who decides what is hate speech and what is fair comment.	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__noRel	I agree with that. We shouldn't incentive hate speech.

__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	I agree with some other opinions on the use of A1 to flag or censor certain words that constitute hate or violent speech. It would also be beneficial to have a human supervisor from the organisation and another external body review the activities of the AI to ensure accuracy and consistency.
__label__noRel	The problem is hate speech needs to be clearly defined. There will be people that use "hate speech" as a means of having opinions they don't like removed.	Is it necessary to have readers comments? What do they add to the article?
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	More emphasis on moderation of specific language would reduce the risk of hate speech. Also, moderators approving comments before they appear on the website would help.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated.

Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	Addressing hate speech should not mean prohibiting freedom of speech which is what you will be doing if the comments' section is removed.

I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__noRel	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	Continuing as normal.	we should keep comment sections on newspaper websites but we should have moderators to filter out any hate speech
__label__noRel	The content is then controlled by the moderators. How do we ensure that a comment they simply disagree with but still adds to the discussion is let through?	Only People from certain age should be allowed to comment
__label__noRel	I dont agree with this as sure it counters the hate speech but that makes me question the reliability of the news article	There needs to be rules and regulations stating the type of comments that can be made about other people.

__label__noRel	I totally agree we have freedom of expression	Community moderation is used on many platforms to allow discussion whilst preventing hate speech from arising, however this is greatly dependent on human participation which can take a lot of work depending on the size of the community. Additionally, the removal of hateful comments can better a comment section, but will not change a commenters views- this has led to the development of more insular online communities fostering these more extreme or hateful views. People will create a space for their commentary if there isn't one provided (or if their comments are removed from somewhere). A lot of this comes down to what a given newspaper wants to be associated with (in the sense of their brand) as opposed to maintaining the sanctity of online discussion.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	I think having moderators who check the comments and remove any that contain hate speech is the best way of reducing it.
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	According to newsy.com, between January and March 2022, Meta took action on more than 15 million pieces of hate speech content on Facebook.

__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	I think that people should sign up and verify their identity before they are able to leave a comment on a news platform so they are not anonymous and anything that is written can be tracked to the individual and they can be held accountable. Many people write such hateful things anonymously.

__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	I think that keeping a comment section is overall good as it keeps engagement but needs to be heavily moderated and regulated so it doesn't just dissolve into a lot of hate speech and grounds for radicalisation

__label__noRel	Agreed. And many of these potential solutions are also not successful at limiting harmful content (https://slate.com/technology/2018/05/the-facebook-upvote-and-downvote-experiment-is-a-bust.html). As long as the platform is comforming to the laws of the country then it should not have to introduce further measures to limit hate speech at the expense of preventing free and open discussion.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	Why do people read comment sections? To get informed and enlightened or because they are nosy and killing time? I think most of the time is the latter. I am not sure the comments expressed at the bottom of a page bring more value to the conversation than they bring potential offence, hatred and fights started just for the fun of it.	Hate speech is a problem but we do need to have debate. We need to respect different views and allow people to voice their opinion where necessary to further a debate on a news topic. Having the comments vetted before they appear does allow for some censorship but that must not be at the cost of open discussion.
__label__noRel	Although the idea of having AI is quite a good one. How accurate will this AI be in detecting hate speech?	Reduce the anonymity that hate-speech writers can hide behind - without that shield some may be less inclined to post because it can be traced back to them

__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	Despite our general right to freedom of speech, hate speech remains inextricably linked to hate crimes and intolerance.

__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	One mainstream way of mitigating hate speech on online comment sections is to pre-moderate comments. This however may lead to a 'biased' viewpoint. A lighter example of this could be how some youtubers delete constructive criticism.
__label__noRel	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	I dont think it is a fair choice. For how long should people be silenced. Hate speech is always going to be around. Shutting people up is not going to stop hate speech.
__label__noRel	It doesn't give a space for hate speech	In as much as we can not let the spread of hate speech continue, closing the comment section is not the solution. The newspaper website should have the option for readers to be able to report comments that include hate speech and moderators should be appointed to check "users" that are violating the rules. There can be filters in place that remove posts that have some of the common hateful and derogatory phrases. outlining the rules and regulations for the website users can help

I think the best way to reduce hate speech in newspaper websites is to ensure that the site can detect words and phrases that can be considered hate speech, and block them from being posted on the comment section. Also, a moderator to approve each comment section before it becomes publicly accessible is a notion which can be adopted as well.
__label__noRel	The problem is hate speech really means political speech. It's a way of silencing dissent of political agendas that are transforming certain countries societies in a way people don't like.

__label__noRel	I agree. This sounds like a good plan.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted.

__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	I still think a filtering system of removing categorically hateful words could help a little, but there is still the big problem of other comments bypassing that. I think an independant and unbiased moderation team could help to remove the issue of the newspapers removing valid critisism or comments about inaccurate reporting for example.
__label__noRel	I think that people should be given the opportunity to have free speech but with people who are paid to moderate comments. Free speech should also include people being given the opportunity to say things others do not agree with as long as it is not promoting a violent crime to be committed against someone.

An article proving AI can be helpful, but can struggle to interpret or detect certain things, suggesting manual reviewing is still very important. https://www.latrobe.edu.au/nest/can-combat-rise-online-hate-speech/ On another note, I also think anonymity plays a huge role in what people allow themselves to post online and think that certain platforms should consider only allowing people to comment under their own identity rather than online handles and such.
__label__noRel	Reduced aggression could lead to less retaliation. If an idea/thought is presented in a balanced way, then a respondent may hopefully be inclined to respond accordingly.	There is a fine line between freedom of speech and hate. And hate can be interpreted differently for different people causing biased censorship. Therefore newspapers should have moderators from both sides of opinion that overlook comments to approve before they are published
__label__noRel	I think DominicJ is onto something however with technology being on our finger tips and Artificial intelligence making things easier i think having a software that can be able to restrict those criteria can be a good thing and will be automated	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	Although i understand why limiting comments would reduce hate speech, unfortunately it then plays to the smaller group in society that causes the problems. The majority of people can have a great debate without taking to name calling etc	By simply monitoring the comments and blocking the negative ones and removing them
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	With rights comes responsibility. We all have freedom of speech but it is our responsibility to ensure that our speech does not cause harm on others. If people do not want to be responsible in their speech, then their speech should be reduced because things have consequences. So, the hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by removing comments with hate speech or having a software that can identify hate speech in a comment before it is posted.
__label__noRel	Slow process. Subject to flaws if misinterpreted by moderators/other commenters.	I think there has to be a system that can verify whether a person's comment contains hate speech and if it is found to contain hate speech, that person should not be allowed to leave the comment.
__label__noRel	Completely agree with this point. Address the root cause of the problem might be difficult but hate speech should be avoided at all costs.	i think one of the best ways is to allow everyone a free space of commenting yet making sure that all the hate speech is automatically blocked no one can see those comments except the administrator
__label__noRel	Surely this would depend on the opinions and ideas of the moderators in some cases unless they followed some standards such as what the UN outline here on hate speech... https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech	I kind of agree, but I think that organisations have a responsibility to put something in place to monitor their comment sections. Even if it's not an algorithm and it's an actual person instead! Although your link shows how difficult this would be for a huge organisation like FB.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	I don't think we can police websites 100% but if comments are moderated I think we can reach quite a high degree of compliance

Also all submitted comments must be thoroughly checked for negative for flagged words or topics.

I agree with the notion that being able to share our thoughts and feelings is a right and having people share their views can help people to question their own thoughts. The inclusion of moderators to prevent people from posting discriminatory or harmful comments would be good, but difficult to ensure these moderators aren't biased towards one argument
__label__noRel	By eliminating readers comments, the readers will not be allowed to give their opinion on the topic, which infringes free-speech.

__label__noRel	it is censorship	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__noRel	I'm afraid there will always people who will be offensive against others	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

At the end of the day hate speech is not hate speech to everyone, I ended up reaching the conclusion that everyone has their own opinion about everything, So to want to filter or block comments is not freedom of speech, but building a sensitive society that is scared of debates and confronting serious issues, Its up to the receiver of the comment to act on it or not.

If the aim is merely to reduce hate speech then I think eradicating the comment section goes too far. Why should people not be allowed to comment and have their say.

__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	It is important that people are able to have a voice, especially as it can be a great tool in educating people, and giving people a variety of viewpoints that they wouldn't necessarily get to often hear.

__label__noRel	Common sense is not common	Moderating comments sections is a lot of work to do manually, the individuals tasked with it would burn out in short time trying to manage that effectively while also having to read hateful garbage all day. If there was a system to remove hate speech it needs to be automated with an algorithm that catches certain words, then reviewed manually when someone disagrees with the content removed and it not being against guidelines. We use guidelines for everything including media regulations for accurate reporting or having to retract when information is not accurate. It's no different in the comments section, it doesn't remove free speech it regulates it to create a healthy environment to have a conversation in. Over moderation can have as severe of an effect as under, it has to be a system that takes in common complaints from both sides. Not the hate speech side per say but the sides of people who are pro free flowing conversation and those who want more shielding to avoid extremist echo chambers.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	Comment space encourages discussion of important topics and allows free exchange of information and so should not be eliminated.

Having a comments section can be ideal to engage in a healthy debate but will need to monitored very strictly to ensure there is no bullying or one sided views be taken against any individuals
__label__noRel	Allowing hate speech, only perpetuates prejudice and discrimination.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.

__label__noRel	I agree that in removing hate speech there is a chance that we could be silencing valid criticism and curtailing freedom of speech. However, I do think that sometimes there can be a fine line between criticism and hate speech and I would much rather see valid criticism removed than to see hate speech spread.	It is not fair if newspapers take away the comment space. I do not consider this to be fair choice in a supposed democratic society/
__label__noRel	The drawback here is that people get carried away and be verbally aggressive and use foul language which doesn't go well with most of the readers who come to view the news and some of the healthy discussions in the comment section. But, all they find it few people engaging in a verbal war which is uncalled for.	create an algorithm that identifies hate speech and removes it
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Alternatively I'd offer the opinion that goes against the question and states that we shouldn't offer a space for readers comments (and thus hate speech) at all on news since it's primarily a site and source for news. Systems like https://ground.news/ have been providing news and removing bias without a social aspect already and since third party social/sharing/commentary sites handle discussion and the problem of hate speech far better than newspaper websites presumably can hope to, the solution seems intuitive: remove it and let that happen organically on other websites and platforms.
__label__noRel	Robots cannot feel empathy or anything to distinguish between a regular comment and a comment containing hate speech.	We do have to allow people to express their opinions - we can't pretend opinions don't exist. Having them out in the open lets us know what we're dealing with. But at the same time hate speech can't be allowed to flourish and absolutely needs to be challenged. There is a role for AI (which I have said before I know) to try and weed out and remove anything that is just pure hate and not any sort of coherent argument or opinion.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	Not allowing anonymous posts as well would force individuals to process comments internally before publishing on a public platform.
__label__noRel	I would like to be able to see why this comment was removed.	Newspaper websites can have an option where other people could report the hate speech comment.
__label__noRel	Freedom of speech should be always encouraged	The question is? Is hate speech not part of free speech? I think people should be left to express themselves however they feel is appropriate as long as they are not breaking an laws
__label__noRel	I agree that there is no need for comment sections under newspaper articles when most of the comments end up being a form of hate speech. A separate platform to discuss these articles would be better as it could be more easily monitored.	Unfortunately, the public's view on acts of terrorism (including domestic) can be strongly swayed by the effective use of such innocent feeling things as comment sections, as these groups may flood such sections underneath reporting of their own acts with sympathetic or 'this isn't an issue' type posts, thus influencing others' opinions directly or indirectly.
__label__noRel	some mistook freedom of speech for spreading the hate speech. Some root causes of hate speech originate from child hood traumas and are deep, i do not think that we may be able to tackle those just for the comment section hate speech.

__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	I agree with FransescoT online forums can be a wonderful community but hate speech with faceless people can ruin it. If you want to comment there should be some accountability.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	It may be a good idea to involve some form of moderators to check if there are any hate speeches. Aggressive comments may be censored accordingly. However, we need to be careful in doing this as some may have negative effect as silencing voices.
__label__noRel	Simultaneously limits freedom of opinion. A censored comment section can hinder thought-provoking discussions	Reducing hate speech shouldn't be the focus. The problem lies in the reactions to it - in particular, giving the drastic perspectives too much attention. This attention only encourages more of the debate and problematic perspectives. Though total ignorance would also be unfair, so really we need a position of just LESS attention and care given to such perspectives.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks.

I am reminded while discussing this of the way Daily Mail in UK handles the comments section.

__label__noRel	Commenting on online platforms with hate speech is a lazy, cowardly way of spreading negativity. If those who partake in this sort of online behaviour lacked the platform to do this, I don't think they would act out in other ways. I think they spread hate online as it's a very easy way to do so and takes no energy and is anonymous.	I agree that the only way to ensure balanced discussion without allowing hate or eliminating genuine responses is through moderation of comments before posting
__label__noRel	This will go against the purpose of public opinion. Public opinion is informative and sometimes educational	appreciate people have different views
__label__noRel	That's a good speech! Unfortunately, in the real world, that doesn't work.

And yes, for the most part, it'll be enough, they have good values and know how to share ideas without hate. But for some, it's not the case...	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment

__label__noRel	someone that works for the newspapers or websites?	My position as a reader and my argument is that bases on the rules of speech people have freedom of speech and expression. That should be done in a proper way without insulting others or hating or being racist in your speech. Websites and newspapers should not remove the comments of the people responding to hate speech. This is done according to the rules found in the following article: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	Hate speech is so prevalent nowadays that proper measures should be taken in order to limit these harmful comments. However to stop people from expressing their opinions is creating another problem altogether. Those who aren't able to make help contributions should be blocked and stripped of their right to do so.
__label__noRel	If newspaper columnists can publish their opinions, why can't the public enjoy the same freedoms?	This is right.

__label__noRel	Readers would ust become more comfortable because it now seems like a platform that has been opened for them to spread hate speech.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	Hi Fabio, I believe you are absolutely right. Comments should definitely be allowed but under some kind of regulation. Not all comments are useful or relevant.	Hate speech can be positive criticism and essential in some posts, altgough it can be offensive and totally uncalled for in other posts. A way in which social media apps regulate and monitor the comments, otherwise people have rights to freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I agree in principle to the idea of moderators, but in practice this can be a pretty blunt tool and quite labour intensive.	I think newspapers should not take away the comment section.

__label__noRel	comments can dilute the validity of the story	I don't think this is possible. We should go back to physical printed newspapers.
__label__noRel	I absolutely agree with that position. As much as I hope and believe people should not resort to hate speech, but rather have a civilized conversation and respect each other's opinions, I am aware people might simply not be capable of that. Also - hate speech is not illegal in most countries. Quote from Wikipedia: "While "hate speech" is not a legal term in the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that most of what would qualify as hate speech in other western countries is legally protected free speech under the First Amendment." Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_in_the_United_States	I think filtering hate speech comments can do that and allowing a better more positive and a welcome experience to all readers.
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Newspaper websites can eliminate space for readers comments for articles that they think are more likely to receive more hate speech

__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted.

It would also be beneficial to have a human supervisor from the organisation and another external body review the activities of the AI to ensure accuracy and consistency.
__label__noRel	Some hate speech is clear, you can moderate the high level hate speech easily with key word bans, however some topics are more nuanced	There is no discussion on free speech to have : free speech is absolute or not. If you don't like free speech then go live in China.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	Some people will always use hate speech and hide behind their computer, There needs to be some sort of filter added to flag such comments and people and a ban put on the user
__label__noRel	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs	i think by just censoring specific words that are hateful/derogatory this could then automically screen out hateful comments that are abusive - i think it should be judged on what would be an offense to say in person. This could then use humans to read and monitor comment boards and then train AI to further do so
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.

Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	Community moderation is used on many platforms to allow discussion whilst preventing hate speech from arising, however this is greatly dependent on human participation which can take a lot of work depending on the size of the community. Additionally, the removal of hateful comments can better a comment section, but will not change a commenters views- this has led to the development of more insular online communities fostering these more extreme or hateful views. People will create a space for their commentary if there isn't one provided (or if their comments are removed from somewhere). A lot of this comes down to what a given newspaper wants to be associated with (in the sense of their brand) as opposed to maintaining the sanctity of online discussion.

__label__noRel	Is this a legally binding contract?	I believe that people are allowed to express their opinions , that is why we have freedom of speech. However with that right, we are not subjected to hate speech, there are so many ways of expressing yourself without using offensive or hateful words. Considering a newspaper is a public platform, I believe everyone should try to be respective at all times. The comment space must not be removed, it helps to get insights of readers and is very helpful. I think the website should be enhanced in a way that it detects offensive language and doesn't allow the reader to continue if they use such. Also, comments should be monitored before being posted to the public.

What really needs to be looked at is to see how you can stop online trolling which I think is the root cause of some of these comment sections become so toxic. But for the media who is so depended on free speech themselves so that they can report on news in an unbiased way to eliminate the comment space is almost hypocritical. Just a weird idea here but perhaps you should do a quick test or verification before you can comment. A lot of people would not go through the effort of completing this if they just want to spread hate.
__label__noRel	I think that removing the comment section on specific topics is important	I think one way of eliminating hate speech is to filter the comment section by certain words that are considered hateful.

__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	I think that things should be reviewed by a moderator, but it is a tough decision what is considered hate speech and what is someone's opinion.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.

__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way.

__label__noRel	Newspaper articles are for delivering news not for people's opinion.	I dont think it is a fair choice. For how long should people be silenced. Hate speech is always going to be around. Shutting people up is not going to stop hate speech.
__label__noRel	Yep, this helps in eradicating hate words and people will notice that such is not allowed	Removing the comment section from online newspapers is not the answer. Allowing people to post their opinions is healthy and a normal part of human society- people will not always agree. However, in order to reduce hate speech, which can so often lead to crime, it could be done so that there are monitors (either human or computer) who check comments before they are posted to ensure they are not hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.

I strongly disagree with this argument. It is very autocratic and happens a lot in countries where media and citizens does not have freedom and oppressed by harsh leadership. Comments in newspapers help many to get raw information from the ground and open minds of many to see issues differently from differing opinions. Indeed comments section are necessary
__label__noRel	could take a while	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	Comment spaces should be moderated, perhaps even approved before posting.
__label__noRel	I appreciate that everyone has the right to freedom of speech but at the expense of others and being hateful?	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	Hate speech is called hate speech for a reason. ALso it is not protected under the guise of freedom of speech. Not forgetting that with every right theres subsequent responsibilities	Allow for a voting system on the comments, so as the cream rises to the top and the dredges sink away.
__label__noRel	Without the option for comments, the news providers become the sole voice of an opinion.	Have a moderator than overlooks all readers comments and makes sure they're all suitable.
__label__noRel	Absolutely correct. The important thing is to identify what hate speech actually means, because what is offensive to one individual might not be to another.	If the aim is merely to reduce hate speech then I think eradicating the comment section goes too far. Why should people not be allowed to comment and have their say. The newspaper is punishing the public for the crimes of a few. It seems rather unfair. I think the best method is to have monitors.

__label__noRel	I think this is a good solution for the problem. People will always find a way around it but it will eliminate at least some hateful comments.	I know this has been discussed a few times potentially in reply to comments but I'd like to repeat it again: language is complex and you can't simply ban or flag certain terms or phrases and think you catch all the hate speech comments etc. While a report button and the use of a software that can support a human moderator is in essence a good idea, it might also delete comments that do not actually contain HS or completely miss others overall. I think this decision by the newspaper turned into an entire discussion of manageability of monitoring discussion sections and away from the ethical considerations.
__label__noRel	I like this idea, it sounds very fair	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__noRel	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious	Be more strict when allowing people to create profiles, that require identification before allowing anybody to comment. Stopping people being anonymous enough to feel confident while posting hate speech I think will be more beneficial than restricting peoples comments.
__label__noRel	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.	By putting in a classing program that will read and class information as it enters. That way things will work nicely and we wont see more of hate speech

__label__noRel	I think using AI would not prove to be very effective. If this AI was to be self-supervised (without any moderators) I think it would quickly start flagging not-hateful comments as hate speech since it's very susceptible to user input - see what happened to Microsoft's Twitter bot Tay. After a couple of weeks, if I'm not mistaken, the AI started posting very hateful tweets about the holocaust and minorities.	The difficulty with reducing hate speech, is that it is everywhere. It cannot feasibly be reduced with human power, but rather requires a computer system. The difficulty with an electronic system, is that it inherently requires money and financing, and therefore is incentivised to make money. When money is in the equation; thoughts, politics and ideas can be easily manipulated by those funding the system
__label__noRel	Possible infringment on data	Some people just like to spread their negative vibes on strangers, not worried about serious consequences, as the worst thing that can happen to them is the comment being removed. There should be consequences!
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks.

Education in media ethics: The first step in combating tribalized hate speech is realizing that, while the right to free expression is a fundamental human right, the rise of social media has produced a number of different channels for its creation, packaging, and transmission. The rights and liberties of journalists and their role in fostering and developing peaceful societies should be emphasized in media ethics education. The political, social, and cultural rights of individuals and groups, including the freedom of expression, must be made more widely known, as well as the obligations and societal repercussions that come with press freedom. Journalists need to have the knowledge and abilities to spot hate speech and disseminate anti-hate messaging.

__label__noRel	Sadly I must agree. Ongoing monitoring of comments would take too much effort and time. It is simpler to just remove the comments and let the newspaper articles stand for themselves. Pople can always link the article to their own twitter post and comment there if they feel the need to add their own thoughts.	I think certain people should be not allowed to share their opinions publicly because their only intention is to create hate and to upset people. Separately, society need to be educated on how to communicate via Social Media.
__label__noRel	The problem with AI is that it lacks morality, thus it can be exploited for other and selfish reasons.	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Although it might be unfair for others, I think majority can agree that removing the comment section will be helpful because then it means anyone that has an opinion can rather call the newspaper.
__label__noRel	I understand that not everyone can be trusted to enforce a well respected community of readers and therefore we should rid that oppurtunity due to previous incidents regarding hate speech.	Online comment spaces should be platforms promoting free speech, with some restrictions in place. Human or digital moderators (AI) could be used to identify comments and phrases constituting hate speech and remove them from the platform without hindering people's ability to share their authentic views.
__label__noRel	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.	Not allowing anonymous posts as well would force individuals to process comments internally before publishing on a public platform.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	I don't think it's helpful to cancel the comment space completely, we should have the ability to post our thoughts.
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	I think the comments should be monitored to avoid hate speech
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__noRel	This would eliminate inappropriate comments	I would not eliminate the hate speech right away but rather alarm the user and ask them to refrain from that kind of speech or ask them to elaborate or explain the reasons for the anger. Maybe as a moderator I would try to understand their viewpoint because by removing the speech there will be just more anger and hatred.
__label__noRel	Agree	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__noRel	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__noRel	As much as I agree with you that everyone should be able to express their own ideas. The internet is full of trolls who are constantly usung hate speech and without any guidelines or moderation. It's quite impossible for there not to be any "aggressiveness."	People tend to comment just to rile others up, which means it will be a lot of work to moderate. Perhaps an all or nothing approach is best.
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Newspaper websites can eliminate space for readers comments for articles that they think are more likely to receive more hate speech
__label__noRel	Common sense is not common	Control what is printed or posted to make sure that it is diverse and does not contain any hate speech but the message they are trying to get across they are able to. That way newspaper can leave the comment section and different opinions are heard and expressed and no one gets hurt.
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	This is like saying if there are less weeds in the garden there is less work. The weeds grow. We have to address the weeds.	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	by checking what people comment befor approval
__label__noRel	I disagree and believe that other views should be respected and be allowed to be aired. If we only read one particular newspaper then our view will become one sided, with a comments section arguing different points, then it opens us up to many other arguments.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?	Allow for a voting system on the comments, so as the cream rises to the top and the dredges sink away.
__label__noRel	people would be forewarned so they could avoid upsetting content	I have found that as well as reading the articles from newspapers, I have also been paying keen attention to the comments section of the article. Either on the newspaper site or on social media. I find that while the opinions of the article presens the views and research of the author, the comments offer an alternative viewpoint and opinions. A chance to see if the article hit the right note, and an opportunity to understand positives and negatives of a topic raised.
__label__noRel	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.	In order for effective moderation to occur, some kind of consensus or clearly reachable policy on what constitutes hate speech (including dogwhistling, which may be less clear to a lay viewer) would need to be in place. This might require too much buy-in from commenters, but is necessary if anything can be consistently enforced.
__label__noRel	Its open to gaming, ie getting stories taken down	I think there must be a system that will detect hateful comments and block them.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	By using a tool that searches for likely words: hate, etc.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	Moderating is good and maybe informing the person why their message was moderated so that they know and do better next time
__label__noRel	Newspapers and the media have a big role to play, but so do others	there needs to be some form of ceneorship of what newspaper can post i dont mean full censorship i just mean around things realating to hate of certain group
__label__noRel	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes	Have human and AI to verify potential hateful speech. Given our current resources we should be able to allocate a human check given the rating of the flag by the AI
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	Regulations of comment sections has been proven with various other platforms to be the best solution. When there are clear rules put in place regarding what should be considered as hate speech and the consequences of the part taking in such could lead to eg. A ban from the being able to comment for a certain period of time.
__label__noRel	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I simply do not agree with your views Andrea. How can anyone living, or wanting to live in a democratic world want to actively curtail free speech in any form. I have done a little online research tonight and it seems my argument can be backed up by various articles and sources. Such as this one https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/	online newspaper will definately attract a lot of people if there is comment section as some people prefer to go through comments first to get insight of the content.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	the website should have terms and conditions on the words that can be used and warnings if failure to follow the recommended words .
__label__noRel	I agree with the sentiment but the use of the word "should" emphasises that some people are not able to practice respect and tolerance as a pre-requisite	I think one way to reduce hate speech online would be monitoring the message. If someone writes a message, it should be checked before allowing it to be posted, it could be done by a simple program where the computer looks for offensive words.
__label__noRel	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion	I think removing the comment space is just avoiding the problem. There can be interesting and thoughtful comments and we would miss from them. Newspapers websites should instead try to regulate the comment space by introducing a bot or hiring appropriate moderators or there should be some punishment to discourage the use of hate speech.
__label__noRel	Having an algorithm do the work will inevitably lead to false positives and will also lead to culprits re-tooling their speech to skirt around the algorithm's 'rules'.	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__noRel	I think using AI would not prove to be very effective. If this AI was to be self-supervised (without any moderators) I think it would quickly start flagging not-hateful comments as hate speech since it's very susceptible to user input - see what happened to Microsoft's Twitter bot Tay. After a couple of weeks, if I'm not mistaken, the AI started posting very hateful tweets about the holocaust and minorities.	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__noRel	Just because something exists it doesn't mean it should be used in a way that it is abused.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	Need clear understanding of what is considered hate speech on this platform.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too	I would almost agree that removing the comments would be beneficial. I've very rarely seen a comment on an article that actually contributed towards learning more about the content. It's typically just people yelling they don't agree without any true thought.
__label__noRel	Issue with time and who gets priority for arguments	The newspaper website platform owners should be held accountable for any hate speech that occurs on their website and they can combat hate speech allowing fellow readers to be able to flag/report posts that they deem hateful.The moderators can then investigate.
__label__noRel	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__noRel	I believe thats an accurate solution	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__noRel	But what can be done about it? Will anything be done even with a report button	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__noRel	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Awareness campaigns need to be implemented to teach people about the significance of avoiding hate speech.
__label__noRel	most topics have at least 2 opinions	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	Flagging comments does work with limited effectiveness, however, like with social media, you will always invite people who want to censor anything they disagree with. Those individuals try to utilize flagging and reporting, ase a tool to bully those that they do not agree with. That is not an effective way to deal with actual hate speech.	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__noRel	it is a great idea	having a screener in the background conrtolling everything thats coming in and also comment section
__label__noRel	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.	block swearing, abusive, discrimatory words- freedom of speech without rasicism, name calling etc
__label__noRel	Hate speech can unfortunetely bean opinion base within this modern world. Being oversentativie to certain comments can pottentially reduce freedom of speech.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	b	Is space for readers comment really that necessary? Nowadays, with all other social medias available, the conversation can happen on platform made for dialogue. But as practice shows, those "conversations" are often very polarized and everyone is kind of screaming in a void.
__label__noRel	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed	Moderating comments is a far better method than eliminating comments entirely. I feel a method for reporting comments, though not perfect, is better, and then reported comments can be examined and removed if necessary.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	I also think the concept of Counterspeech to reduce the impact of hate speech could be beneficial.https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/counterspeech-better-way-tackling-online-hate
__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	It hink a moderation is required for hate speech. Removing the entire comment section is not an ideal option. However, hate speech is alsoa crime. It is clear that there should be some monitoring in social media in terms of tracking down the user when necessary so similar terms with the real world would be valid. If you make a crime in real word you get you will stand trial so similar option should be valid for social media.
__label__noRel	I disagree with this. Previous to social media and comment sections, newspapers often printed responses from readers. Journalists and those giving opinion pieces should face scrutiny and feedback from readers.	It must me a government's responsibility to implement policies against hate speech.https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-to-combat-fake-news-and-disinformation/
__label__noRel	The negative aspect would be how moderators are going to decide whetehr it is a hate crime or not. Manupliating the moderators could be an issue.	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	I agree with this	I think by holding the people that use hateful speech accountable i.e., blocking them from accessing newspaper websites
__label__noRel	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.	the comment section should not be disabled as is it there for the readers to engage with the content uploaded so it makes no sense to close it, however there should be restrictions.
__label__noRel	I agree,the should be someone who's hired to check comment and to block.Also those who bully people shoul not be allowed on the site	Despite my defence of human moderators, it seems they too are flawed -- check out this article https://www.technologynetworks.com/informatics/news/ai-trusted-as-much-as-humans-to-flag-hate-speech-365777 -- human moderators are not only prone to bias but also impractical. With the huge wealth of content posted every second online, it is unrealistic to expect humans to be able to view, criticise, and moderate every single comment.
__label__noRel	people will not be able to voice out their opinions and views openly	we can reduce hate speech by blocking out certain words so that it can not be viewed publicly. and blocking the user using hate speech

Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__noRel	https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/juraba52&div=30&id=&page=	I agree that it all should be reviewed before it is published
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	I am reminded while discussing this of the way Daily Mail in UK handles the comments section. It just mentions on top of the comments page that theses comments are not moderated.So it allows everybody to express their opionion. This is how it should be done in my opinion
__label__noRel	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.	you ca reduce hate speech by adding an ai bot that can distinguishly remove between violent words from a comment. A report button is as useful which can allow for moderators to review comments and decide on the level of polarization.
__label__noRel	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.	We need to create a society where we can debate with each other respectfully, we can know which platforms to use and not rile each other up without offending. It is widely suggested that education can address the extent of hate speech: https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/addressing-hate-speech-through-education-global-education-ministers-conference. However, this needs to go hand in hand with moderation of sites to ensure people are kept within reason. It is not a case of any one single solution.
__label__noRel	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?	Removing the comment section will not solve the problem. It will just create a filling of censorship and will make debate and dialogue vanish. It is important that people discuss news topics and also give feedback on those news to the newspaper. It is important to moderate this comments in a strict no hate speech way and bring accountability in. Eliminating comments will just hide a problem that needs to be fixed by moderating and educating people.
__label__noRel	the same as my idea	Reduce hate speech by screening out certain words. If a comment contains such words, it is deleted or hidden from public view
__label__noRel	The newspaper should also boost positive messages of tolerance.	Although it would be fair to allow for both critical and positive input, I believe that newspaper websites should have a mechanism in place that can identify hate speech and restrict individuals who use it. This would prevent readers from freely using hate speech.
__label__noRel	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.	We can start by encouraging people to debate and say their opinions to incite meaningful and helpful conversations and comments instead of hate and other harmful communication types
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	allow people to say what they feel

__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	I agree with most of the commenters here, there needs to be moderation. Even if you don't agree with the arguments there are ways of saying it that do not fall into 'hate speech'.
__label__noRel	Yes, any form of hate speech should never be tolerated.	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__noRel	In the book "Noise" it talks about taking the median for everyones view and making that the regulation. The conversation then becomes which views qualify as each end of this opinion spectrum? Surely not the hateful ones but a modicum of their views so they feel included instead of fuelling their distrust of systems not built for them.	However there is the potential to much greater exposure to it on online than in past times. Therefore I continue to believe that greater controls on those posting comments will decrease mindless hate speech and promote constructive debate.

__label__noRel	While yes we should all be able to communicate freely, with the anonymity of the internet internet trolls go too easily unpunished and their actions not removed	Well..hate speech is a problem then there is freedom of speech as well.

__label__noRel	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?	Hate-speech is part of free-speech, it's hard to focus on one without affecting the other so what should be done is to write articles differently, a neutral way where both sides can see themselves because we become less aggressive when we feel part of a group

__label__noRel	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.	If the aim is merely to reduce hate speech then I think eradicating the comment section goes too far. Why should people not be allowed to comment and have their say.

__label__noRel	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.	Educate people about it

This is similar to what lots of people have been saying regarding worrying that this sort of censorhip could overextend.

__label__noRel	As technology becomes more advanced, there are algorithms that detect hate speech, for example on Twitter. People can also report hateful comments so that only appropiate comments are left.	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__noRel	AI could be the first step flagging any potential wording or offensive phrases and a human could doublecheck	Using tool, that automaticully remove discussions where is wrong kind words
__label__noRel	Speech cannot be violence in and of itself. What you are suggesting closes down public forums and debate, enhancing the impact of closed minded thinking and echo chambers in our society.	Asking people to identify themselves when doing their registration. If we remove the anonymous factor, people will be afraid to act like trolls.
__label__noRel	I agree	I think that moderation is the most effective way of preventing hate speech. Filtering comments would not work as it is difficult to find a algorithm for the context of a comment. Free speech is so important it should not be removed.
__label__noRel	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments	I think hate speech is always going to be a problem unfortunately, and although websites can monitor comments and remove any hate speech what ultimately is needed is teaching people there are better ways to get their opinions across and better use of freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	Everyone is entitled to freedom of speech but hate speech can be detrimental to readers and the topics mental health. I think the best way to deal with hate speech is to have filtered comments, raising awareness and age restrictions on wensites and comment sections
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	A possible way to address hate speech on newspaper sites would be to incorporate both human moderators and some sort of AI that monitors for hateful words and comments. The requirement to submit personally identifying information before commenting might also help because without this then anyone can create a fake name that hides the person's true identity so therefore more likely to engage in hate speech. If personal information is required, then hate speech would be less likely.
__label__noRel	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.	Moderation is key. Plenty of newspapers and online media are able to keep comments open with a bit of moderation.
__label__noRel	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also	Although it might be unfair for others, I think majority can agree that removing the comment section will be helpful because then it means anyone that has an opinion can rather call the newspaper.
__label__noRel	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__noRel	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.	People who take part in hate speech should be dealt with lawfully so as its a form of cyber-bullying, that way less people will resort to hate speech
__label__noRel	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.	Moderating comments sections is a lot of work to do manually, the individuals tasked with it would burn out in short time trying to manage that effectively while also having to read hateful garbage all day. If there was a system to remove hate speech it needs to be automated with an algorithm that catches certain words, then reviewed manually when someone disagrees with the content removed and it not being against guidelines. We use guidelines for everything including media regulations for accurate reporting or having to retract when information is not accurate. It's no different in the comments section, it doesn't remove free speech it regulates it to create a healthy environment to have a conversation in. Over moderation can have as severe of an effect as under, it has to be a system that takes in common complaints from both sides. Not the hate speech side per say but the sides of people who are pro free flowing conversation and those who want more shielding to avoid extremist echo chambers.
__label__noRel	also would allow anyone to say whatever hate they havem to say	everyone should be entitled to comment and have opinions but the comment section should be checked and hate comments deleted and that user blocked on the website
__label__noRel	People may not be trusted to keep the hate speech moderated.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?	hate speech revolves around certain words or slurs so if those word can be banned or even not allowed and the comment does not show up on the actual site it will help curb hate speech
__label__noRel	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?	Hate speech is subjective and as such should not be censored.
__label__noRel	The disadvantage of having free speech it causes people to think it is Ok to bully, lie or name call other people and this causes more chaos and leads to more hate which is not the path that most newspaper websites want.	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__noRel	The newspapers aren't reading consumer input though. The only people reading the comments section are other consumers. The only purpose they serve is announcing your views to everyone else reading the same article. It's unnecessary and people's opinions are rarely changed by what they read in the comments section from some random reader/commenter.	I think people should be able to express their feelings, but there should be a way to block hate speech
