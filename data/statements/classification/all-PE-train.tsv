__label__Evidence	When people are given choice to comment, trolls will come out naturally and therefore so will hate speech. You can only educate those willing to be educated.
__label__Evidence	Collectivism as a philosophy has historically been used to commit atrocities and silence political dissent against oppressive regimes, such as in the case of Stalin's USSR.
__label__Evidence	school uniforms stunt young peoples' creativity.
__label__Evidence	In Germany, 60% of the land is used for animal feed. In determining how much subsidy a holding receives, the area of the holding is decisive. In other words, a lot of land, a large amount of subsidy. This results in cheap animal feed and, ultimately, intensive livestock farming. Thus, if the state subsidises animal feed and livestock farming on the basis of their size and not on the basis of sustainability and animal welfare, the concept of intensive livestock farming will be supported.

__label__Evidence	people simply can't compete with others in the same professional setting once they reach a certain age, mandatory retirement is necessary for fair competition in a limited job market
__label__Evidence	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Evidence	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Evidence	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.

__label__Evidence	there should not be a limit to executive compensation, they deserve to be compensated based on the profits of the company.
__label__Evidence	by providing a high compensation to the executives of a company you can get a higher quality employee and the business will make more money. therefore we should not limit their pay.
__label__Evidence	we should not adopt gender-neutral language because it is stupid to change the way people been speaking for hundreds of years
__label__Evidence	graduates earn more over a lifetime than their peers, this gives them plenty of opportunity to repay their debts.
__label__Evidence	With genders now being more equal than ever, and gender neutrality growing exponentially the old gendered language is just a historic anachronism.
__label__Position	Having moderators or AI to automatically remove content that includes keywords with cursing or inflammatory language, having a report/flag button so people can report and remove very offensive things
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Evidence	factory farming helps to produce meat at a lower cost thus enabling those on a lower income to be able to purchase meats.

__label__Evidence	Cashless transactions are recorded by banks. So, the data will reveal the critical data of people regarding where they spend money. The government can easily access the data of anyone. It may result in mass surveillance programs. This goes against the right to privacy. Cash gives us anonymity.
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Evidence	we should limit it, laws should not be changed for special circumstances
__label__Evidence	I don't think we should rely on AI or algorithms to safeguard comment sections. Algorithms are only as reliable as the coding, and that is done in total darkness.
__label__Position	Allow others users to rate the comments and block those who receive bad ratings
__label__Evidence	there is no need for oppressive restraints on people's behaviour so we should adopt libertarianism.
__label__Evidence	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Evidence	telemarketing helps introduce customers to new things and services they may not have heard of had they not been prompted into the subject.
__label__Evidence	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Evidence	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Evidence	We should not adopt libertarianism because people's lives are better when they know they have a social safety net to fall back on, and that they won't starve if they lose their job.
__label__Evidence	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Evidence	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Evidence	capital punishment is absolutely needed. it acts as a deterrent to prevent future crime. if a person knows they can be killed for their crime, it deters them and also makes sure they aren't released from prison
__label__Evidence	Maybe while helping economic integration in Africa to happen, we will discover that we could go further in our own EU development. We could foster transnational companies which operate on both continents but not primarily the very big ones. I think of companies that supply solar power solutions to rural areas or microcredit banks. Create platforms where best choice and best practice solutions can evolve. This way, we can establish a single common market.
__label__Evidence	This is a good idea, people might not even realize what can be classed as hateful if they've never experienced it before.
__label__Evidence	definitely agree with this comment,there is no place for aggression in an adult debate
__label__Position	Another way of dealing with the hate speech without removing the comments section is by asking the moderator or admin to remove the comment once you as a reader see it. https://www.unia.be/en/areas-of-action/media-and-internet/internet/how-to-deal-with-hate-speech

__label__Position	The EU should strengthen the integration of Ukraine through intensified cooperation
__label__Evidence	just because someone has reached the age of retirement, they are still able to provide a vaulable service with expertise and a vast knowledge of experience.
__label__Position	Freedom of speech does not mean freedom of consequence, just because you say something it should not be without consequence if it is harmful. Hate speech is harmful and should be restricted and most of the time it is not constructive or helpful.
__label__Evidence	atheism allows for the decrease in religious discrimination and would maintain equal practices to insure that peole are treated equally with the shared lack of religious faith.

__label__Evidence	missionary work puts people in intrusive positions against those who have inhabited the same land and have had the same customs for centuries.
__label__Evidence	Have you actually read the comments on a newspaper article!
__label__Position	I think that the introduction of moderators to remove any hate speech would be beneficial. Perhaps the introduction of guidelines as to what constitutes permitted negative comments.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Evidence	because it protects the rights of the individual to live as they see fit, it promotes acceptance of the rights of all individuals within society, creating a more inclusive society.

__label__Evidence	inclusive language is the first step to creating a society where the lgbt community is not abused
__label__Position	eliminating the comment space on the internet would not only reduce hate speech, it would also remove the positive comments so i don't think this is a good idea at all. Regulation would encourage discussion whilst allowing people to express strong opinions without resorting to hate speech.
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Evidence	There is a spread of policies that come under the heading of population control ranging from the coercive to the persuasive.
__label__Evidence	The newspapers aren't reading consumer input though. The only people reading the comments section are other consumers. The only purpose they serve is announcing your views to everyone else reading the same article. It's unnecessary and people's opinions are rarely changed by what they read in the comments section from some random reader/commenter.
__label__Position	newspapers are there to give news.most times it is not the comments which bring the hate but rather the non ethical journalism that we have online and physically today. newspapers should not have comments and rather do what they were made to do: deliver news and let the people think for themselves. i believe too many people rely on other comments and interpretations of news to make up their mind, eliminating critical thinking.

__label__Evidence	For more than 50 years immigration has been going on uncontrolled and unchecked. No changes need to be made before we have an agreement that people ignoring our immigration laws should be detained in repatriation facilities with no chance of re-entering the EU.

In the long run, relations among colleagues may turn bitter. Whereas, in fixed pay schemes, the employees are able to maintain cordial relationships in the office.
__label__Evidence	In my point of view it will be essential to impose some compensatory levies on products from third countries to ensure that they will not have a competitive advantage.

__label__Position	This evidence suggests steps can be taken to reduce hate crime, and maybe websites should take this into account, as Romania, which does not have these models in place, have higher hate crime online. However, how do we know this isn't just a cultural difference, rather than the efficacy of reducing hate crime in other countries?

__label__Evidence	cosmetic surgery is not needed, and vain.
__label__Position	Personally, I do not mind hate speech. It does not offend me. For the readers that are offended by it, they should have ways to eliminate it by maybe having the option to not see positions that contain certain words for them. Each reader should have the option to choose which words they regard as hate speech.

__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.

__label__Evidence	I agree. People should not stay silent through fear of someone taking offence at what they say. How can people figure out what their viewpoints are on things if they aren't allowed to ask questions are think aloud?
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Evidence	There are several international treaties, including those of the United Nations and those of the European Union—to which the member states are bound—that recognize the right to self-determination of peoples. Unfortunately, the European Union does not provide any sufficient and appropriate mechanism in order to allow the citizens and the peoples of the Union, i.e. individually and collectively, to enjoy that right. I thus approve and endorse the proposal for a clarity mechanism on the right to self-determination within the European Union, facilitating an internal enlargement process for greater subsidiarity.

__label__Evidence	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Evidence	abolishing the right to keep and bear arms would put all innocent people at risk because people who want to kill will find a way to do so and innocent people will be defenseless

__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Evidence	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Position	Eliminating space for readers is not the solution because most of the time we use the platform to share our experience and knowledge with other readers which might be helpful for other people.a person who use hate speech need to be blocked .
__label__Evidence	Capital punishment is more humane than other extreme punishment like permanent solitary confinement or guard abuse.
__label__Position	We should have personal documents (ID, Birth certificate, etc.) recognized in all EU countries

__label__Position	No, because the newspapers should only provide information and journalism, the hate speech should be condemned by the public, not censored by the newspaper
__label__Evidence	Autonomous car development should be continued to help find safe, renewable energy sourced transportation for the masses.
__label__Position	Should the comment space be removed, it should be evaluated how it will impact the newspapers and the readers. We can agree that what might be view as bad can also be viewed as good on the other perspective. Besides through conversations and other platforms hate speech is still used, trying to reduce it does not mean it will completely be used in the real world as well such as in the streets or TV.
__label__Evidence	we should continue to support cosmetic surgery as it helps people correct imperfections that cause poor self-esteem.
__label__Position	Comment sections need to be well-moderated, and if algoritmic or user comment flagging is used this needs to also be reviewed by a human moderator to ensure that there is no bias or bad faith reporting going on.

__label__Evidence	no need to subsidize student loans, people can access education by using their own money and time
__label__Evidence	people are not always aware of their failing mental faculties and mandatory retirement is necessary.
__label__Evidence	First, we should empower people more: put an emphasis on education and build a control mechanism for internet propaganda, e.g. force transparency on which content is truly human and which is sponsored or created by organizations and companies. Second, we should criminalize deliberate misinformation properly. Third, we should restructure the representation of people in the European Union. After all the above-mentioned, we can think about establishing a more binding role of petitions to the European Parliament.
__label__Evidence	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Evidence	mandatory retirement means that there opportunities for younger people become available regularly and people retire before they become inefficient at their jobs.
__label__Evidence	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Evidence	School prayer is divisive and requires children to either support religion without question or be treated as different if they do not wish to attend, which marks people out by their differences at an early age.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	lower taxes and more freedom from big government would be the result if we adopted libertarianism.
__label__Evidence	Criminals are often kept on death row for many years, suffering in anticipation of their death. This makes capital punishment more severe than just depriving the criminal of life.
__label__Position	In recent years, there has been an increase in the amount of hate speech appearing in newspapers and on websites. This has led to calls for action to be taken in order to reduce the amount of hate speech. However, there is a debate about how this can be done without also eliminating space for readers. One proposal is to create a list of words that are considered to be hate speech and to ban these words from being used on newspaper websites. However, this would require newspapers to censor their content and would limit the ability of readers to express themselves freely. Another proposal is to encourage newspapers to moderate their comments sections more carefully. This would involve removing comments that contain hate speech and banning users who repeatedly post such comments. However, this would require a significant amount of resources and may not be feasible for all newspapers. It is clear that reducing the amount of hate speech on newspaper websites is a complex issue.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

__label__Evidence	I agree, this kind of moderation would be helpful
__label__Evidence	student loans should not be subsidized as the enhanced education they receive will allow the students to go on to better paying jobs.
__label__Position	A lot of technologies have an interface which removes certain hate words/offensive words and I believe this should/could be implemented. Or somebody needs to me a moderator and monitor the comments perhap
__label__Evidence	yes, in this way since it will be able to detect hate speech, and readers will still have a chance to news others options, nor to add their thoughts into the account.
__label__Evidence	We should not ban missionary work because some countries do need help in term of educations, health and spiritual needs.
__label__Evidence	human cloning should not be banned as it the next step in medicine and will allow for transplantation to be simpler and easier to perform
__label__Evidence	prayer in school shouldn't be prohibited because it could result in many social benefits
__label__Position	We can reduce hate speech by regulating comments that are attacking a certain group with no true basis or facts
__label__Position	you have to hold people accountable don't let them hide behind anonymous usernames if they are hoing to say hateful things let everyone know the kind of person they are
__label__Evidence	Yes this is a very important consideration in that we dont operate in a homogenous society. and culturally we are not the same, so what I consider harsh hate speech might just be considered banter to another group of society.
__label__Evidence	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Evidence	Data is considered a ‘new form of wealth’. Generally, companies use data to understand the requirements of consumers and also to influence their behavior.

__label__Evidence	a multi-party system spreads votes out to thin,so as one leader can be victorious even though they did not receive the majority of the peoples' votes.
__label__Evidence	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.

This article speaks of the combination of these two: https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/08/online-abuse-artificial-intelligence-human-input/
__label__Position	I feel like this is definitely the way to go about this. I don't think taking away the comment space is the most ideal option as it feels as if your voice is being taken away. There needs to be more things in place to ensure people's safety. It's a sad world we live in these days that people feel the need to comment hate towards others.
__label__Evidence	we should abolish the right to keep and bear arms because i think we have the proper government and people to take care of and protect us.

__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words.

Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Evidence	This would be very helpful

__label__Position	freedom speech is good but it assumes that common sense prevails too
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Evidence	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Evidence	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments

__label__Evidence	Having leaders with great power across Europe that nobody directly voted for is of great concern.

__label__Evidence	legalising prostitution will ensure the safety of both the sex trade worker and client
__label__Position	We could monitor responses, blacklisting offensive words and possibly having unbiased humans monitor it
__label__Evidence	the executives already earn enough money to give more incentives, those incentives have to go to steps below where they are necessary
__label__Position	Moderation, as a paid (not volunteer) role.

__label__Evidence	If value of standard currency falls, we can still afford to live in our country, because the fall of currency value impacts all fields.

__label__Evidence	I have to agree with DamianC above, I notice a lot of hate speech on twitter for example and I feel this would if anything create more problems as they would have zero control over the platform.
__label__Position	Removing the comment section from online newspapers is not the answer. Allowing people to post their opinions is healthy and a normal part of human society- people will not always agree. However, in order to reduce hate speech, which can so often lead to crime, it could be done so that there are monitors (either human or computer) who check comments before they are posted to ensure they are not hate speech.
__label__Evidence	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Evidence	This only works if you're young and healthy, otherwise, you're a bad risk for private health insurance and it will become even more expensive

__label__Evidence	let the free market decide whether or not we should allow factory farming
__label__Evidence	i think so,people should be able to express their views but comments must be moderated
__label__Evidence	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Evidence	in a democracy people have a right to choose not to vote
__label__Position	Awareness campaigns need to be implemented to teach people about the significance of avoiding hate speech.
__label__Evidence	anyone can edit the pages, so the information is not guarenteed to be correct.
__label__Position	True
__label__Evidence	space exploration is a waste of taxpayers money and should be funded by private enterprises.

__label__Evidence	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Evidence	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Evidence	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Evidence	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Evidence	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't legalize cannabis because it might get children addicted at a younger age if it's easier to acquire
__label__Evidence	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Evidence	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Evidence	student loans are a massive burden for people getting the degrees necessary to qualify for a job to become a productive member of society.
__label__Evidence	libertarianism fosters a more equitable and efficient society for all

__label__Evidence	adopting atheism would put a stop to conflicts that arise through conflicting religious beliefs making the world a safer place.
__label__Evidence	also called intellectual plagiarism none of this makes sense there may be people who think the same and that is not a crime
__label__Evidence	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Evidence	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Evidence	Many technologies like electric vehicles still plug into the grid and use fossil fuels. We do not have a zero emission grid yet.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Evidence	judicial activism allows judges to argue their own views instead of making decisions based on existing constitutional law.
__label__Evidence	I agree
__label__Evidence	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Evidence	That people can write hate comments
__label__Evidence	gender-neutral language should not be adopted as it will cause resentment among those who strongly identify with either their birth or adopted sex
__label__Position	Also another thought is I am wondering if Newspaper websites are the best place for discussions and comments, after all they are not government or public services, they are companies at the end of the day trying to sell newspapers or subscriptions to their services which increases their profits which it pays to their shareholders. Would a forum type website (like Reddit, or Quora, or maybe something new) be a much better location for these discussions, and by shifting the location to somewhere like this comments and media can be moderated and if anything breaks their rules posts can be removed before it becomes visible?
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Evidence	capital punishment could be applied to innocent people
__label__Evidence	Completely agree with this! Both by human moderator and maybe AI to help identifying and flagging posts that could contain hate speech based on keywords.
__label__Evidence	we should not because we are messing with the natural order of things and can cause more problems.
__label__Evidence	pride parades cause too many problems in the community. they disrupt the peace and cause a lot of litter
__label__Evidence	the most basic right we have is freedom of religion, and it is very strong personal belief. atheism strips that away and should not be encouraged.
__label__Evidence	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Evidence	people buy cannabis regardless of whether it is legal or not, so we might as well tax it to make extra money
__label__Evidence	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Evidence	Why can't Arab countries shelter refugees from other Arab countries? Same habits, religion and they have enough wealth.

__label__Position	user logins can allow for better regulation of comments
__label__Position	there are people who go in the comment section just to argue and cause distress to other people commenting and that needs to be monitored and comments removed if necessary
__label__Evidence	Trolling is human nature, it will never stop so measures need to be placed because this problem will never change unless people change. https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/03/29/the-future-of-free-speech-trolls-anonymity-and-fake-news-online/
__label__Evidence	For Europe to act outwardly as a unit, we must first look inward. At the psychological level, how can we create a European home market? What does it take, for example, for a resident of Spain to think of Czech printers as a local product? Will it be possible to reach an agreement on Europe's historical events and interpret them to everyone's satisfaction? This process will take some time.
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Position	We should ban NGO boats and take migration out of the EU's hands
__label__Evidence	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Evidence	Hate speech on newspaper websites reflects bad on the publication. Therefore, removing hate speech is quite essential.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	We should restrict immigration.
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading allows for more timely, accurate, and efficient trading.

__label__Evidence	people should have the freedom to eat what hey want.
__label__Position	You can let people create an account with a full name so they will have to think more about what they write and can't so easily spew hate
__label__Evidence	we should not ban factory farming because it gives us another source of food.
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Evidence	a multi party system allows far better choices for the diverse population, meaning they can find someone to vote for that they truly believe in and participate in a democracy better
__label__Evidence	Thats why its best to have set rules. Like swear language, certain words, threats and stuff like that but anything that is just opinion should be allowed no matter if you disagree or don't like what is said.
__label__Evidence	We should not abolish the three-strikes laws because they are popular with voters and it would be undemocratic to remove them.
__label__Evidence	we should ban human cloning because it raises too many legal questions regarding ownership and identity.
__label__Evidence	I agree with this statement, however, we all know that users will just sign in under another ID. But agree in principal.
__label__Evidence	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	Hate speech is hidden love that is just imperfectly expressed and should be protected
__label__Evidence	Factory farming allows us to fill a high demand.
__label__Evidence	I agree with this argument. It is important to balance the right to freedom of speech against the need to reduce hate speech.
__label__Evidence	nuclear weapons prevent certain countries being attacked and help to keep world peace.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	Today, cannabis repression is simply a political posture aimed to target rightwing voters, not a rational policy.
__label__Position	The EU should focus on pragmatism
__label__Evidence	these parades help support and bring gays into the open
__label__Position	The more I examine this issue, the more convinced I am that moderation is the key. Often in these situations, one side is coming in specifically to dishonestly represent the facts and in many circumstances, flat out fabricating, I think this article can explain a lot of what I am proposing: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiusKTzsPv6AhXTRMAKHa9vCkQQFnoECC8QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fscience%2Fbrain-flapping%2F2014%2Fsep%2F12%2Fcomment-sections-toxic-moderation&usg=AOvVaw0VBlEl0ndsB4s5IMnsHS4I
__label__Evidence	minors are not old enough to know the consequences and health risks of such surgeries.
__label__Evidence	safe spaces are a place where minorities of any sort are safe to be who they are and are safe from discrimination, negative comments and harassment and in today's intolerant society are much needed.
__label__Evidence	although we hope never to use them, we need to keep our nuclear weapons as a deterrent against others using them therefore we should not abolish them.
__label__Position	Studies are indicating that comments on news articles can colour readers' perception of the article's content itself. By including unmoderated comment sections that can be full of hate speech and misinformation, journalists could actually be said to be reneging on their main responsibility -- which is not to elevate the speech of others, but to report on the news factually and objectively. https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/internet-comments-and-perceptions-of-quality/371862/
__label__Evidence	I agree, this would be the perfect balance

__label__Evidence	why should homosexuals have a pride parade?heterosexuals don't have them!
__label__Evidence	The international community has already acknowledged that nuclear weapons are bad by signing a number of nuclear nonproliferation and test-ban treaties, and the next step in international cooperation should be the abolition of nuclear weapons.
__label__Evidence	It would render the meetings useless since they would only be able to express official statements and instead negotiate new ideas without pressure.
__label__Evidence	if wikipedia was subsidised they may start to put in whatever information the person supplying the subsidy wants rather than only the truth and this would be harmful.
__label__Evidence	private military companies provide an armed protection for some that may not have it normally
__label__Position	We do have to allow people to express their opinions - we can't pretend opinions don't exist. Having them out in the open lets us know what we're dealing with. But at the same time hate speech can't be allowed to flourish and absolutely needs to be challenged. There is a role for AI (which I have said before I know) to try and weed out and remove anything that is just pure hate and not any sort of coherent argument or opinion.
__label__Evidence	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Evidence	pmcs can provide security to those countries and organisations that need protection and are capable of paying for it, so should not be banned
__label__Evidence	this would ensure everyone got punished if they broke a rule
__label__Evidence	Giving small countries 'veto rights' is a recipe for disaster that will keep the European Union separated and weak instead of united and reliable in policy making.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__Evidence	child actors lose the sense of a proper childhood.
__label__Evidence	multi-party systems are proven around the world to work better
__label__Evidence	judicial activism is a control key put in place for counterbalance the overuse of power of law
__label__Evidence	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Evidence	many brands are now offering healthier options such as salads & vegetarian foods, just because its called fast food doesn't mean its unhealthy
__label__Position	removing comment sections on newspapers to avoid hate speech will never benefit anyone and will not solve the issue but it might help applying algorithm that will track words and sense tone from messages typed in by individuals. If the algorithm sense vulgar or hateful tone than must not allow the message to be posted.
__label__Evidence	Since most of the climate change is caused by big organisations, I dont think just adapting to climate change is the right thing to say. There is a lot that is out of our hands.
__label__Evidence	But it also means that the newspaper will have full control over what is being posted and can filter certain opinions as well as hate speech to create a biased community look if they want to. Since they would never go on air, there would be no history of the page you can compare to.
__label__Evidence	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	I think there could newspapers should have a policy where they have the right to delete any comment that is hate speech.
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Evidence	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed

__label__Evidence	how do you decide what is disrespecful?
__label__Evidence	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Evidence	we adhere to these principles and these spaces to guarantee behaviors that make us feel safe, therefore safe spaces should not be abolished
__label__Evidence	many people could pay long sentences for nonviolent crimes
__label__Evidence	https://time.com/5739688/facebook-hate-speech-languages/
__label__Position	There could be a list of community guidelines that commenters would have to scroll through and check "I agree" or something similar before having access to the comment section. The community guidelines could include things like "No personal attacks" "No racial slurs or profanity" etc. It is important to remember that something is not automatically hate speech just because you are offended by it. Censoring all criticism and comments is not the answer, and neither is allowing a group of moderators to determine what is and what isn't hate speech. Community guidelines with clear outlines on what is and what isn't allowed is fair for all. Do not leave anything up to speculation.
__label__Evidence	Training AI to do that would be a great way to prevent this phenomen
__label__Position	People commenting with hate speech should be fined
__label__Evidence	we should adopt gender-neutral language because gender-neutral language can improve women's status in society
__label__Evidence	wikipedia has no source of funding and subsidizing it will let it keep providing information
__label__Evidence	we should not adopt a zero-tolerance policy in schools because some of the teachers would misuse the policy
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	It is time, to be honest about this! Europeans have the right to self-determination like every other country out there! This is OUR home and a home for everyone is a home for no one.
__label__Evidence	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Evidence	But is it even possible to fix now or is it too far gone?
__label__Evidence	nuclear weapons serve as a deterrent for other nuclear countries through mutually assured destruction
__label__Evidence	the olympics are an expensive operation and the city selection process is corrupt.
__label__Evidence	As Yuval Noah Harari says “What we need now are morality and spirituality. Morality is about reducing suffering in the world. And spirituality is about questioning and looking for answers. Religions provide us just with answers and no scope of questions.”
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Evidence	it allows others to steal and profit from someone else's creation.

__label__Evidence	facial surgery is a common reconstruction for people who get involved in car accidents. cosmetic surgeries is the only solution for them to recover their face they destroyed in the accident
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Position	We should stop admitting minorities that we are unable to manage
__label__Evidence	We should legalize the organ trade because currently people are punished for obeying the law and not purchasing organs, in the form of longer wait times.
__label__Evidence	we live in a modern world where men and women should have the same opportunities. many sexists words like anchorman for example give the impression that jobs are only for certain sexes.

__label__Evidence	we should not subsidize journalism because it acts to protect poorly run and inefficent media companies from normal market forces
__label__Evidence	the three strike law is too strict for some offenders
__label__Evidence	The newspaper has the duty of educating and informing the public. One-sided articles should not be allowed as they fail to give a full perspective and may even spread misinformation, if there commenters are not allowed to correct or add a new perspective.
__label__Evidence	I am in favor of a possible army, but I would like to see it combined with social services and reconstruction. So NGOs and development cooperation must be involved. An army that can fight must also be able to build. We therefore also need a civilian army in Europe. I would also like an army consisting of civilians in uniform, in the same way as the German army. Please also take into account the right to refuse orders due to conscientious objection, also as in the German army.

__label__Evidence	The dangers of allowing free speech has been constantly seen in different moments. A recent time was when Donald Trump Instigated riots in America, causing damage to buildings and applauding it... making it worse and worse
__label__Evidence	the use of child actors should be banned because child actors end up having more money than they know what to do with and thus misuse it.
__label__Evidence	zoos force animals into an existence outside of their natural habitat for our viewing pleasure. it is not right to subject them to such an environment.
__label__Evidence	certain professions, such as police officer and air traffic controller, have mandatory retirement ages to ensure that the person who is responsible for the safety of others remains competent to do his job
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Position	Keep the comment space, and filter or censor explicit words.
__label__Evidence	cannabis is not a harmful drug and can help people cope with mental issues like anxiety
__label__Evidence	If 99 out of 100 people are having a normal civilised debate, 1 'troll' can muddy the waters of the whole community, without some vetting of posts it would be a mess
__label__Position	Have comments checked before posting
__label__Position	It still seems important to focus more on reporting the news and far less on giving a newspapers opinion of the news. But straight news doesn't make the clicks or the money. Looking at the current changes to CNN are a good indication that anger sells and straight news does not.The anger is what keeps the comments sections alive.
__label__Evidence	We should not adopt libertarianism because the business cycle would destroy the country's economy without regulation.
__label__Evidence	as individuals we have a right to not be grouped into one thought process.
__label__Evidence	space exploration gives insight into our world and other planets which could be invaluable.
__label__Evidence	Without journalism people have no way of having the information that empower them to make informed voting decisions, making journalism central to democracy and therefore in need of subsidization.
__label__Position	I think that people need to take a deeper look into the amount of hate speech that actually occurs online. We need to start at the root of the problem. Check out some informatiion from Stop Hate UK.. https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/what-is-online-hate-crime/
__label__Position	We should make sure the personal details are acquired before commenting
__label__Evidence	we shouldnt abolish intellectual property rights if you have come up with a new idea for something then it should be exclusive to you and you should be acknowledged for it
__label__Evidence	legalized sex selection would help couples prepare for the birth of their baby
__label__Evidence	sex selection is unnatural and will have long term negative consequences on society. we will become overpopulated with male children and females will become targets of sexual crimes.
__label__Evidence	Nonsense. Mass migration is a crime against humanity. Endorse this idea: No more immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Position	how about only allowing certain words/sentences to be used within the comment box, or even just emojis?
__label__Evidence	the marketing of organs could take a positive step since there are many people who die young of brain deaths could family members sell their organs would be something positive
__label__Evidence	The EU needs to establish a legal means of preventing illegal migration that is encouraged by the Turkish government and by privately funded NGOs, which are acting against the interest of the EU.
__label__Evidence	cannabis is highly addictive, studies show up to one-in10 users develop dependence over time
__label__Evidence	judicial activism allows for a check on decrees made by one branch of the government that may think that drastic action is needed for every situation.
__label__Evidence	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Evidence	I think it's a little more nuanced than curtailing freedom of speech. If we define the right to free speech as "the right to speak, write, and share ideas and opinions without facing punishment from the government", you have to consider that news websites and social media are not moderated by the government or required to allow freedom of speech. If a news website is to be truly impartial, I don't personally believe that opinions of the layman provide any benefit and can often be harmful. That however, is only my opinion ;)
__label__Evidence	true, but maybe they can remove anonymity so that everyone can be accountable for what they say.
__label__Evidence	if people can afford it then it is their choice
__label__Position	Comments need to be checked before being sent to the public because some of these comments can destroy some public figures
__label__Evidence	Only if Europe has an energy partnership with Africa Europe will be able to produce enough clean energy. The EU should develop fair cooperation with the African Union and also offer Africa an alternative to the geopolitical attempts of other powers to establish themselves as global hegemons.
__label__Evidence	children should be free to do what they want with their consent and their parents consent
__label__Evidence	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Evidence	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Evidence	According to the United Nations Convention on the rights of people with disabilities, the European Union “shall closely consult with and actively involve persons with disabilities” on political decisions that concern them. Meanwhile the “European Strategy for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 2021-2030” hardly mentioned people with intellectual and neurological disabilities. Now the Conference for the Future of Europe wants to be an inclusive citizen consultation but is still not making it a priority to include citizens with Trisomy 21, autism, or members of other neurodivergent communities. Ableism keeps getting perpetuated in the EU and it needs to stop. We want more representation! We want people with Down Syndrome to be fully included in the European Union institutions!
__label__Position	I think having a filtering system to block certain hateful words could help and moderation of comments/report systems.
__label__Evidence	legalizing organ trade will help people looking for a specific organ to find it easier.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Evidence	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Evidence	Destroying nuclear bombs would work to a nations disadvantage because they will be vulnerable to attacks
__label__Evidence	pride parades can be a dangerous place
__label__Evidence	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Evidence	pride prides are an expression of free speech and therefore, constitutionally protected.
__label__Evidence	mandatory retirement amounts to age discrimination and can leave those who are forced to retire without the sense of purpose that work could bring.
__label__Evidence	compulsory voting can help encourage better results during elections
__label__Evidence	stem cell research is our best hope in finding cures
__label__Evidence	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Evidence	Mass migration is hybrid warfare directed against our stability. NGOs organize, finance, and promote migration to get advantages.
__label__Position	Someone should monitor the comments in the website such as administrator or moderator. Or comments need to review first by administrator before it can be posted on the website
__label__Evidence	human cloning should be banned because it allows designer humans to be grown according to the parents wishes.
__label__Evidence	if the government provides funding to wikipedia the impartiality and therefore reliability of the information held on there may be compromised
__label__Evidence	Targeted killing surgically removes enemy actors with no collateral damage, it must be continued.
__label__Evidence	cosmetic surgery for minors is unnecessary because they are still developing.

__label__Evidence	I agree, it's important to make sure that the way we design filtering criteria is not another centralized mechanism which undermines fairness.
__label__Position	newspaper might remove comment section as a way to prevent hate speech. however, it does remove freedom of speech to those who would like to express themselves through comment section.
__label__Position	https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/the-comment-moderator-is-the-most-important-job-in-the#:~:text=Moderating%20content%20and%20comments%20is,cultural%20norms%20and%20acceptable%20behaviors.
__label__Evidence	nuclear weapons are a form of deterant and are needed
__label__Evidence	I don't believe this really. There are scientists who definitely dispute that humans are a cause of climate change. They also cite many types of weather patterns that cycle over and over over thousands of years that are also part of the cause.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Evidence	cannabis especially the skunk variety can be very harmful to people and can lead on to them using harder drugs so therefore it should be illegal.
__label__Evidence	I agree, feelings should be left out when giving your views.

__label__Evidence	cannabis has been shown to be safer than alcohol and less addictive. there is no real reason to keep it an illegal substance.
__label__Position	I don't think removing the comment spaceis a good idea, people should still be given a platform where they can voice themselves out. Having a team look through the comments and find those that include hate speach and remove them and maybe ban the people whith hatespeach comments from ever posting comments again.
__label__Evidence	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Evidence	The Olympic Games have become too controversial lately with politics, doping and other issues and should be banned.
__label__Position	I found this really interesting, "Khan said the freedom of opinion and expression, including the right to seek, receive and disseminate diverse sources of information, must be upheld by States in times of crises and armed conflict as a precious ‘survival right’ on which people’s lives, health, safety, security and dignity depend." This is similar to what lots of people have been saying regarding worrying that this sort of censorhip could overextend. (https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/10/protect-freedom-expression-vital-survival-right-civilians-armed-conflict-un)
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Position	Adaptation and fighting climate change often go hand in hand
__label__Evidence	missionary work can be viewed as the exploitation of a disadvantaged culture by a privileged culture.
__label__Evidence	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Evidence	a zero tolerance policy at school is a good idea because children need to be disciplined as it might cut crime in the future.
__label__Evidence	by adopting general-neutral language usage we send a clear message to children growing up that life is not segregated or determined by one's sex.
__label__Evidence	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Evidence	journalists put their lives on the line when they report news from war zones, or shootings or natural disasters.

__label__Evidence	sometimes a cosmetic procedure is necessary in cases of disfigurement, and when this is addressed early, the chances of recovery and normalised existence are maximised.
__label__Evidence	telemarketing is perfectly fine, when handled by telemarketers appropriately and politely with respect to potential customers
__label__Position	it is very important not to be hateful to other people and their opionions,rather just not say anything.
__label__Evidence	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Evidence	Lockdowns are not the answer to the problem. Look how the lockdowns for the virus have caused the economy to go downhill and the depression and bad effects on the people both socially and psychologically
__label__Evidence	I feel this really limits free speech. Speech should be free as long as it's not harmful. Not all comments are mean/come from bad intentions. Without having additional comments, there wouldn't be a richness of opinion in the news.
__label__Evidence	the church of scientology is a dangerous sect we shall not allow anymore
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Position	I do agree with this, especially the screening by charities or organisations, but I would add unbiased independents (as long as they were competent).
__label__Evidence	Migrants willingly risk their lives.
__label__Evidence	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Evidence	an austerity regime would make for a more powerful and united country
__label__Evidence	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	This article made me reflect on the definition of hate speech and I aggree with blocking comments that go against a persons protected characteristics - if a comment like that is made, it should instantly be banned from the platform / comment section. https://about.fb.com/news/2017/06/hard-questions-hate-speech/
__label__Evidence	we should legalize prostitution because it will be regulated meaning the females will be safer
__label__Evidence	sex selection could lead to gender inbalance in some societies.
__label__Evidence	Exactly, regulation is necessary, either by a software or an actual person
__label__Evidence	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Evidence	Targeted killing will help clean up the streets faster.
__label__Position	India is safe for women
__label__Position	Primary Health Care (PHC) is an indispensable good for equitable and high-quality care in Europe and beyond
__label__Evidence	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Evidence	The only way hate speech can be combatted is through open debate. Any restrictions on speech by the newspaper have the implication it could restrict this open debate and allow those with hateful comments to become isolated and potentially commit violence if their views go unchallenged.
__label__Evidence	A similar tool is being used for music, to identify if it's DMCA free or not, if the music is commercial they ban your account online. Same thing should happen with hate speech. Scan the online media for bad words, specifics and then remove the comments all together.
__label__Evidence	algorithms may not be 100% accurate and reflect the situation in the real market
__label__Evidence	School uniforms are bad for children's self-image by making it even easier to compare themselves to other students.

__label__Evidence	Setting a mandatory retirement age allows for the younger generations to move up the ladder and to better support their own families.
__label__Evidence	fast food is high fat and unhealthy food
__label__Evidence	how do you regulate what hate speech is and who by?
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Position	it would be good to put in place trigger words to help stop hate speech being loaded onto the site.
__label__Evidence	nuclear weapons create such irreversible damage that we should all agree to remove them as an option.
__label__Evidence	the tradition of the olympic games is brilliant for pulling together all countries of the world that it should never be abolished.
__label__Position	Bad comments have to go if you got a bad comment you should delete and report
__label__Evidence	Correct
__label__Evidence	Africa and the Middle East have the highest birthrate in the World. Africa has up to 7 children per woman. The EU has 1,55. It is this high birthrate that keeps them poor. There is almost nothing the EU can do about it.
__label__Evidence	school uniforms keep all kids equal while at school learning and that is a great thing so school uniforms should remain.
__label__Evidence	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Evidence	if everyone adopted atheism it would bring more social cohesion and less wars. most conflicts, whether official wars or not, usually relate back to religious beliefs and convictions.
__label__Evidence	it would lead to governments better reflecting the public
__label__Evidence	Nuclear weapons are an expensive to build and maintain. These resources could be put to better use.
__label__Evidence	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Evidence	minors have not yet fully developed and changes to their bodies that they make now may not be what they would have chosen when they are fully developed.
__label__Evidence	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Evidence	Through close-knit communities or micro-communities based on shared interests on social media along with private messaging, social media gave us an opportunity to build real connections with people we can really relate to.
__label__Evidence	It will be difficult finding people who will remain unbiased on issues they feel strongly about.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Evidence	I agree that key words could be added to some come of algorhythm to stop people using them.
__label__Evidence	Having an open platform allows racists to have a forum to vent
__label__Position	I think if all comments go under review for hate speech, that should still allow a chance for hate speech comments to be retracted
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Position	We need a better EU migration policy.
__label__Evidence	As the sustainability goals of the UN contain working conditions, human rights, environmental & climate issues together with questions of governance, they are ideal to incentivize sustainability in all sectors and fend off unsustainable practices and competition.

__label__Evidence	Censorship causes imposition of majoritarian ideals on others.
__label__Evidence	There is enough environmental task to handle and Europe have had its wars. But to streamline our powers and therefore try to save huge amounts of money is a no-brainer.
__label__Evidence	Total elimination of comments would not allow a discussion to take place
__label__Evidence	it allows people to interact and share their opinion on the subject.
__label__Evidence	There has to be better funding for research, but it should not be administered top-down. Let researchers decide rather than politicians. Do not stifle research by bureaucracy. At the time being, with large consortia getting multi-million euro grants, the application process has become too complicated for most researchers. Rather invest in reproducible, transparent, open research.
__label__Evidence	fast foods are extremely high in calories, and it's easy for a person to exceed the recommended number of calories when they eat fast foods
__label__Evidence	Pragmatism was in the EU’s DNA since its inception, but this is sadly no longer the case. The current EU is not a moral authority, it is a political organization based on mutual interests and political diversity.
__label__Evidence	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Evidence	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Evidence	we should not subsidize wikipedia because the information contained in it is not validated. if published information is going to be subsidized then it should be from accredited sources.
__label__Position	There are many news sites, that have recently been found to not fact check and the apology or retraction oes not reach the level the original false article raised. I think the comments section can be invaluble to allow people to discuss and not be so one sided.
__label__Position	We should stop the mass migration from Africa and the Middle East
__label__Evidence	I believe ALL websites with ANY content are responsible for the messages their content conveys - be it articles, podcasts, videos or comments.
__label__Position	By using a tool that searches for likely words: hate, etc.
__label__Evidence	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Position	Negativity is permitted and valid but hate speech is not. People do not deserve to hide behind the arguement of "free speech" to spread hateful messages
__label__Evidence	safe spaces are essential to enable minorities to have freedom of speech and expression without the danger of oppression.
__label__Evidence	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Evidence	That will take too long time to do manually, so it's best to ban some words in the start. If the user is using to many of the banned words, then ban the user automatically.
__label__Evidence	Commenting on online platforms with hate speech is a lazy, cowardly way of spreading negativity. If those who partake in this sort of online behaviour lacked the platform to do this, I don't think they would act out in other ways. I think they spread hate online as it's a very easy way to do so and takes no energy and is anonymous.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.

__label__Evidence	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Evidence	the 3 strike law is unfair and many people are punished too severely.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	Maybe if the person commenting can only do so through a social profile like Facebook, it would police their response more so than being anonymous? Although someone can just make a fake account and I have seen people ruin their social reputation by saying questionable things online very publicly and not caring so moderators may be the best option.
__label__Evidence	I think using AI would not prove to be very effective. If this AI was to be self-supervised (without any moderators) I think it would quickly start flagging not-hateful comments as hate speech since it's very susceptible to user input - see what happened to Microsoft's Twitter bot Tay. After a couple of weeks, if I'm not mistaken, the AI started posting very hateful tweets about the holocaust and minorities.
__label__Evidence	more political parties give people more of a choice to support what they believe in.
__label__Evidence	we could not support economic sanctions as it only hurts both countries financially in the long run.

__label__Evidence	zoos are cruel to animals, because often if a human does something stupid the animal will get shot or killed.
__label__Evidence	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Evidence	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	we should limit executive compensation for national ecomics
__label__Evidence	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Evidence	telemarketing provides jobs. the economy is already unstable and lacking jobs. what are these people supposed to do if their job is banned? no one forces you to talk to them. just hang up.

__label__Evidence	There is no credible evidence that the death penalty deters crime more effectively than a prison term
__label__Evidence	Compared to most anglophone countries, Europe has been quite timid in attracting talent across the globe. Too few people know of and make use of the EU Blue Card. The EU is a destination of choice for migration and refugees from developing and some neighboring countries.
__label__Evidence	One sided opinions
__label__Evidence	The problem is that hate speech can esculate and end up working against the newspaper's interest. People don't want to spend time in a fully toxic environment.
__label__Evidence	It might lead to fake profiles
__label__Evidence	the church of scientology should be banned as it is a cult not a religion
__label__Evidence	cosmetic surgery is dangerous to start with, why should people make such risky moves for vanitys sake?
__label__Evidence	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Evidence	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem

__label__Evidence	olympic games is useful to countries as it provides a boost to the countries economy by the increased tourism during the time of the tournament.
__label__Evidence	Each migrant in the European Union must be given the possibility to integrate even if the refugee status is not clear. Integration programs could support this development in all cases.

__label__Evidence	school uniforms help stop bullying because when people are similarly dressed, nobody is made to feel inferior.
__label__Position	Provide a reminder to commenters that ensure all comments to remain civil and that some people may not share the same opinion, and that is okay.
__label__Evidence	No. If the parliament was given free rein to start taxing people directly, they would of course abuse this power to fund their own pet projects because MEPs want to feel important and increase their own power above all else. It's good that the member states (via council decisions) can explicitly decide the size of the EU budget. And until the democratic deficit and other systemic problems in the EU are fixed, it's good that the budget is kept at 1-2% of the total EU GDP.
__label__Evidence	we should adopt atheism because it gives the freedom from being bound by a religion and their rules
__label__Evidence	The possibility of extinction as a result of nuclear war justifies their abolition as a precaution which protects all of humanity.

__label__Evidence	I think forcing people to eat a limited amount of meat is totally the wrong way because of the following reasons: 1. It would cause so much more bureaucracy 2. forbidding it would understandably make a lot of people very mad. I mean who likes to be told what to eat? 3. I think it's important to have the freedom to eat what you want I think a much better solution would be to increase the tax on meat. Making it less attractive for people.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	I totally agree. Freedom of speech is very important, but if it goes too far and it becomes online harassment, then it's time to treat it as a criminal offence.
__label__Evidence	I agree with this. They are quite good nowdays and can be used accurately to spot mature language
__label__Evidence	Every human being has a conscience that allows them to recognize what is true and what is good, and it is by virtue of this awareness that we demand that no European Union funds be allocated to activities that destroy human embryos.
__label__Evidence	child actors are supervised constantly, are well taken care of, and have tutors on set to keep them from falling back in school.
__label__Evidence	It would reduce hate comments to the max.
__label__Evidence	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Position	It would be very difficult to achieve without removing the ability to comment (which, in my opinion , isn't t he best solution). That's the nature of internet anonymity.
__label__Evidence	I do not agree with stripping people of their right to asylum and a right to live in the EU because they came illegally. I would instead suggest making it easier to migrate legally. That way there would be no need to migrate illegally and risk your life while doing so.

__label__Evidence	sex selection could lead to genetic abnormalities and start society on a slippery slope of genetic editing at a time when it is an imperfect, untested procedure that could lead to horrific outcomes.

__label__Position	due to the changing world and the improvement of technology,the internet is like a black canvas and anyone can put anything they want on it,but even though technology is improving most websites dont use basic protection,they could do things like add comment filters,then this ensures that hateful words or phrases cannot be used but positive and informative words and statements can be

__label__Evidence	Though we have been establishing national-level institutes for the past 40 years, we haven’t been investing to maintain their standards. Funds are needed for quality education.

__label__Evidence	We haven't got enough jobs and money for everyone in Europe! Stop immigration! However, Turkey, Qatar, Oman, Egypt, U.A.E., and Saudi Arabia have it! These countries can therefore welcome migrants instead of funding hundreds of mosques in Europe!
__label__Evidence	Student loans are necessary to be able to afford the cost of college. Subsidizing the loans allows more people to gt a degree and not have to leave to earn an income before they finish.

__label__Evidence	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Evidence	I do not agree with the idea of submitting a large amount of personal data. That is unenforceable and goes against the GDPR. I also do not understand the 're-education' argument. Who is supposed to educate them and are these supposed "educators" professionally qualified?
__label__Position	I am not sure you can fairly reduce hate speech without completely removing the comments space. Or you will have to have someone monitoring every single comment made to make sure it is not hateful. Unfortunately all speech is free speech, we just might not like what is being said.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Evidence	there is no need for gender-neutral language. someone could be an actress or an actor and can identify as either without changing the language that we use.

__label__Evidence	zoos allow people to see many animals in their natural habitat that most people would never see.
__label__Position	The EU should strengthen its ties with Ukraine and prepare an EU membership of Ukraine.
__label__Evidence	I would like to strongly support the need for Europe to gain back an active role in the diplomatic efforts to try to stabilize the Middle East and in particular to find a just and fair solution to the Israel - Palestine conflict. I remember that the European Union - with the Venice Declaration of June 1980 - played a key role in pushing the Palestinians to the table of negotiations. That text was much criticized at that time, but with the benefit of insights, it was right! Europe has become more and more marginal in the peace process and this has contributed to a much-aggravated situation where problems are even more difficult to resolve than 40 years ago and create room for despair and violence.
__label__Evidence	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.

__label__Evidence	It's by no means irrelevant what kind of cars people use; 25% renewable + 25% nuclear + 50% combustible is better than 100% combustible gasoline.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Evidence	missionaries are just trying to spread positivity into the world.
__label__Evidence	subsidizing journalism would bring more accurate reporting because it would allow for the hiring of more qualified reporters.
__label__Evidence	whaling serves no purpose, there's no great benefit. it only serves to disrupt the ocean ecosystems and cause needless suffering. it should absolutely be banned.
__label__Evidence	Banning hate speech will radicalize people who will only feel more oppressed by the opposition trying to silence them.
__label__Evidence	I can see their point of view, however hate speech can't be considered a viewpoint as most times there isn't even a good enough argument to support people that leave hate speech's point of view.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Position	regulations and setting values is the most paramount phase to consider when planning to eliminate hate speech from newspapers websites which clearly state that should anyone go beyond these rules will then be held accountable .
__label__Position	The first position is that readers comments must be filtered to remove any comments that contain hate speech. The second position is that filtering comments is in itself an infringement of freedom of speech, and that people should be free to express themselves the way they want to. The bottom line is that readers get a chance to express their opinions in the comments section and tackle social issues but it should not be done in a way that will hurt other people in any way. The comments section encourages healthy engagement and debate.
__label__Evidence	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Evidence	That is a great suggestion, that way, we all get to voice our opinions and the newspaper doesnt censor the views of their readers.
__label__Evidence	we should prohibit this because it affects the development and normal behavior of children
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Evidence	Banning comment section is not a solution at all, the ban of comment sections is also the ban of freedom of speech/ opinions over all. The idea behind comment sections is for readers to share their different thoughts regarding the News with each other which is very important.
__label__Evidence	economic sanctions will hit poorer people in the affected country more than politicians.

__label__Evidence	Zoos keep animals in captivity and deny them the right to their natural environment therefore they should be abolished.
__label__Position	read though the comments and only put on the comments with the less hate speech on
__label__Position	before people can comment, they should be required to complete a short survey that can detect their opinions on the issue, then the results would be used to whether allow the person to comment or not
__label__Evidence	Newspapers are biased, therefore requires readers to fact-check and challenges their articles.
__label__Position	Although my default position is against censorship of free speech, I have to agree with certain commentators here that the comments expressed at the end of articles rarely have anything enlightening to add to the article, mostly it's just a way for the man in the street to vent and feel their view is being heard. I'm sure most of us can empathise with the feeling of helpless and invisibility a lot of commentators express.
__label__Evidence	it is dangerous to have a community where so many people have lethal weapons
__label__Evidence	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Evidence	the right to keep and bear arms is antiquated.
__label__Evidence	collectivism too often causes the individual to suffer needlessly
__label__Evidence	as quality of life improves and the average lifespan increases, mandatory retirement looks more and more out of step with the modern human life experience.
__label__Position	Comments sections should be removed. They serve two purposes, echo chambers and arguing. Few people ever change their opinions based on the comments section of a news article. People who feel the need to announce their views on a public forum and demand everyone agree with them is a running trend. When someone doesn't agree and dares to voice an opposiing opinion the conversation can quickly devolve into name calling and personal insults. While this behavior doesn't always fall into the category of hate speech it is still toxic, damaging, and all too common. https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation
__label__Evidence	we live in a society which is diverse imposing collectivism on certain issues may go against some peoples beliefs.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Evidence	there would have to be agreement across all platforms regarding which words were filtered out.

__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Evidence	It's extremely hard to draw the line. Surely someone being extremely harmful and discriminatory can just claim 'well it's free speech' ?
__label__Position	Maybe it is time to increase our love for each other and decrease hatred by practicing empathy. Getting to know each other in the real world will always be more constructive for our society than hating in the virtual world.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	Newspapers and magazines are currently struggling and need subsidization to stay solvent.
__label__Position	Have a moderator than overlooks all readers comments and makes sure they're all suitable.
__label__Position	I believe that this whole debate has been had. What needs to be implemented not just in regards to election matters or health related matters is a fact checker system available on all sites like one that was available on twitter.

__label__Evidence	Some students are taking education loans to study and then they have to work hard to repay their loans.

__label__Evidence	Having school uniforms doesn't infringe on free speech since students can exercise that right in other ways.
__label__Evidence	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.

__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Evidence	if someone has worked hard to get where they are in a company then they should be rewarded accordingly.
__label__Position	I think comments give the ability to the users to express their opinion on what is described in the articles and this is an important rule for democracy. Removing the ability to comment in my view is basically limiting free speech. I also believe that user do not need necessarily to be identifiable, being anonymous is fine as long as they respect others and their opinions.
__label__Evidence	something needs to be done about 'hate speech' so moderators would be a good idea,

__label__Evidence	the roles of child actors cannot be fulfilled by adults so it would be impossible to ban their use.
__label__Evidence	lowers the risk of hate speech being needed
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	economic sanctions work as intended and getting rid of them would make it more difficult to punish offending countries.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Evidence	we should ban whaling because it is leading to the extinction of whales

__label__Evidence	factory farming is harming the environment on a large scale
__label__Position	I think removing the entire comment section is not a solution because hwen people do domething bad we cannot ban the entire platform. If people are stealing money we cannot close all the banks. We can try to reduce the robbery!
__label__Evidence	Nice point
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Position	I think that if we don't do something to start combatting climate change today, literally nothing will be there in the future to worry about - no economy left if there's no livable Earth left to inhabit. We're going to have to address this at some point, why not now? I'm not convinced that we can reverse what has already been done (ie, extinct species), but we can change the course of the future.
__label__Evidence	Population experts expect that the world's population will plateau in several decades without any coercion. Educating people about effective means of birth control and social responsibility could have some effect of speeding the leveling of the population sooner. There doesn't seem to be the need for drastic measures.
__label__Evidence	school uniforms limit the ability to express one's self.

__label__Evidence	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Evidence	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Evidence	Since the invention of machines, the value of workers is decreasing. They are made to work to support the machines. As a result, work revolves around machines and not humans. Workers are forced to work continuously along with the machine.
__label__Evidence	wikipedia is an amazing resource that just about everyone uses. if it were to disappear many people would lose out. subsidizing it would be beneficial to all.
__label__Position	Fact Checking may be a better solution than moderation that censors posters of fake news or hate speech. Research shows that censorship can serve to cement the posters conspiracy views (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304422X19301159). A 'fact checked' type flag could be helpful instead.

__label__Evidence	My concern is that comments could be flagged as inappropriate in bad faith e.g. to shut down the opinions of those people disagree with even if the comments are not inappropriate or hateful

__label__Evidence	Europe should look at the European people first. It is not fair for the working classes to have to live within the ruins of multiculturalism while the middle class supports immigration from within their gated communities.
__label__Evidence	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Evidence	Industrialization increased work hours. Workers faced inhuman conditions. Humans cannot work and focus continuously like machines. Fast forward to today, we have technological devices to check how many hours we actually work. Some companies want to be connected 24 hours a day through emails and messages. This makes people feel less human.

__label__Evidence	economic sanctions have had a positive effect on denuclearization
__label__Evidence	we should abolish the olympic games because it very expensive to host
__label__Position	Free speech is an important component of society and comments on newspaper articles can often enhance the article itself by providing additional evidence and balance. However, the anonymity of the internet allows for extreme views to be aired that go beyond what a newspaper website is comfortable publishing. To address this, both automated bad language detectors and a set of both editorial and user moderators should be present. A final point is to allow post-moderation, e.g. users can report offensive topics to the moderators.
__label__Evidence	we should not limit judicial activism because it is an important check and balance on the legislative and executive arms of government.
__label__Evidence	companies invest billions into research, if there are no rights it would dissuade companies from conducting research in the first place.

The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them.

__label__Position	I tend to agree that newspapers should provide spaces for dicussion. It encourages people to read about the topic before making comments and peopel can easily reference reference the article in their comments. I think this allows for a more fruitful and productive discussion that on other platforms e.g. social media. However, hate speech is certainly an issue and easily derails conversations. While moderation of hate speech would be ideal, the burden on the newspaper is likely too great to do this manually. Perhaps a mixture of auto-moderation (flagging/removing key words), manual review by the newspaper and some form of community moderation may work well together.

__label__Evidence	Regularly scheduled mini lockdowns are a possible part of a solution. More ideas like these need to be formulated and multiple avenues have to be explored and implemented.

__label__Evidence	journalism is a dying profession that is increasingly corrupt, so why use tax money towards it?
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Evidence	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?

__label__Evidence	Accepting refugees escaping from death situations is surely an act of humanity. Rohingya people have been treated brutally by the Burmese government due to racism. Being a neighboring country, we should be accepting those people who are in deep distress.

__label__Evidence	We can have a strong federal Europe that will protect the rights of individuals and communities, that will have the power to tackle the climate emergency, and stand up to other superpowers.

__label__Evidence	whaling is cruel and inhumane; it should be banned.
__label__Position	I think what should be prioritized is the option to let people say their perspective. It is difficult to ensure that no one promotes hate speech, but we should be able to allow people to say what they would like to say, following strict guidelines provided by the website.

__label__Evidence	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speech from newspaper platforms without eliminating space for readers comments I personally think when a hate speech has been posted, a report must be made immediately and the admin can deleted the hate speech
__label__Evidence	At present, India does not have a well-developed infrastructure to ensure the security of data. On the other hand, developed countries already have an efficient infrastructure. So, rushing toward data localization may not be a wise step. Because without efficient infrastructure, the data is prone to cyber-attacks. And the risk is severe here because it is financial data. But as the laws are made, it is a big challenge to develop efficient infrastructure at a faster pace.

__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_in_the_United_States

__label__Evidence	On the one hand, we have Russia killing countless Ukrainians and committing sabotage in Britain and the Czech Republic, and on the other hand, we have reluctant United States that is switching between isolationist and interventionist policies every 4-8 years. I stand convinced, that in order for the European Union to move forward, it must begin to introduce measures for the security of both, the current member states as well as the future member states that are endangered due to foreign aggression and bring the responsibility of continental safety firmly in our own hands. If Europe is to find the peace it must have the means to create peace by being able to protect itself against hostile foreign influences.

__label__Position	One way to reduce hate speech on the platform would be to counter-argue the persons non factual point with actual resource backed up facts. Facts are hard to dispute and bringing in emotion to an argument makes you look bad, whereas showing facts shuts down their opinion while educating them and everyone else in the comment section. Source for this: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/take-action/engage
__label__Position	I don't think removing the comment spaceis a good idea, people should still be given a platform where they can voice themselves out. Having a team look through the comments and find those that include hate speach and remove them and maybe ban the people whith hatespeach comments from ever posting comments again.

__label__Evidence	Why couldn't you directly comment on the newspaper? How is a different platform going to really help?
__label__Evidence	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Evidence	This is unlikely to be feasible. United states courts have repeatedly upheld a right to anonymity in this context: https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/why-ending-anonymity-would-not-make-social-media-better.php
__label__Evidence	When state elections are conducted along with the center the regional parties may get marginalized because the same party getting majority in the center may get votes in the state as well.
__label__Position	We should end illegal pushbacks.
__label__Evidence	whaling should be banned as a matter of urgency. cruelty to such majestic, large animals is inhumane and unnecessary.
__label__Evidence	zoos are an outdated and cruel form of entertainment that enslaves captured animals and leaves them in climates they are often not suited to.

__label__Evidence	organ trade should be legalized to help meet the demand of patients waiting for a life saving transplant
__label__Evidence	Hate speech is a blurred line and comes in different forms based on factors such as geography.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Evidence	it is still too early to allow autonomous cars to move freely
__label__Evidence	human cloning could allow parents an opportunity to replace a dead child and baby with a new child that is the same. this would help them deal with their original loss.
__label__Evidence	The huge data we produce every day is analyzed and fed into our devices through algorithms that we end up giving more and more control of our lives to the gadgets. We may feel that we receive all these services for free, but they come at the cost of our precious time and attention.
__label__Evidence	in the interests of bring communities together we should prohibit school prayer and embrace a non-religious outlook.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Evidence	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Position	I think everyone agrees here that comment regualtion is necessary.
__label__Evidence	The present international economic system and trade institutions are too much a product of the not-so-glorious colonial past. We should put more democracy, more rights for people, and more equality into the international economic order.
__label__Evidence	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Evidence	However a view point can be expressed appropriately as a constructive criticism by the target audience. Therefore you could argue that anyone who engages in hate speech is the wrong audience.
__label__Evidence	we should subsidize student loans as these are our future leaders and workers and we want to ensure their success in order to secure the countries success.
__label__Evidence	Not all organ transplantation surgeries are successful. The body of recipient may reject the organ of the donor.

__label__Evidence	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	I think news outlets should not encourage hate comments, which some do (e.g. MailOnline) by their headlines and stories they choose to run and how they write them. I also think there should be a screening process for anyone who wants to post a comment.
__label__Position	I still think a fliter needs to be added and then a mod can look over any comments that are flagged. This would likely stop people from leaving hate, if they know that their comments will not be posted/seen by anyone.
__label__Position	The comments could be examined for offensive language. For instance, there might be a robot that scans comments for offensive language and deletes them.
__label__Evidence	every religious person has the right to pray
__label__Evidence	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Evidence	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.

__label__Evidence	Bringing Social Media into the discussion is irrelevant in my opinion. We're specifically talking about removing hate speech from newspaper websites. The whole point of social media is to present opinions, share your life etc A newspapers website should be a place for news to be disseminated
__label__Evidence	Ukraine is a part of Europe—geographically, diplomatically, and culturally. If Ukraine wants to join the EU, we should grant our brothers and sisters full membership in our Union.
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.

__label__Evidence	Less disruption to public life, less road traffic, and less loss to our economy. As all the government staff can be used at a single time, we can also increase vigilance, and factors like black money, booth capturing, etc. can be reduced.
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	Human populations are approaching carrying capacity on planet Earth. The scientific community thinks this is a number on the order of 9 to 10 billion people. Without population control, there can be no effective solution for reversing the effects of human-induced climate change.

__label__Evidence	missionary work should be banned as some people can be forced into this line of work due to pressure from religious communities.

__label__Evidence	This is bad for the environment and also limits some people from reading news, even if free.
__label__Evidence	I agree
__label__Evidence	In a democracy, people have the right to decide on any issue that affects their lives. If more than half of the inhabitants of a region want to form an independent state, they have the right to do so. Going against it is going against the will of the majority of citizens, and therefore, against the very essence of democracy.
__label__Position	Whilst I am pro keeping comments (with appropriate mods), to look at the arguments against: Removing comment sections allows the focus to be on the article, and if individuals still want to voice their opinion on it, they can still do so on another media platforms which allows the free speech. This 'extra step' may discourage troll users from leaving hate as 1) they are not as visible/cannot make as much of an impact on another platform and 2) interfaces such as Twitter and Facebook have their own moderation techniques.
__label__Position	freedom of speech is essential but hate speech is not. comments should be left on but perhaps there could be a programme which finds key words and eliminates the comment if it seems to be hateful
__label__Evidence	Other comments can also make other people sad

__label__Evidence	Imagine how terrible we all would feel if we made the planet cleaner for everyone only to find out it was a hoax?
__label__Position	There can be no real European democracy without the autonomous fiscal power of the EU.
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Evidence	capital punishment helps keep murderers from ever leaving prison.
__label__Evidence	a poll shows that more than 90% of the people are in support of a multi-party system in the usa.

__label__Evidence	of course the feedback loops will contribute but the question is how much
__label__Evidence	zoos hold animals in cages when they should be free
__label__Evidence	private military companies allow people with money to hire their own armies to force others to do what they want. military forces should only be allowed at national level.

__label__Evidence	libertarians stand for everyone being allowed to have the most freedom possible, which most people usually want anyway.

__label__Evidence	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Evidence	safe spaces act to stifle free speech
__label__Evidence	capital punishment for the most violent crimes is acceptable because it costs thousands of dollars to keep a prisoner incarcerated for life.
__label__Position	I think nowadays most people keep up to date with the day's news via social media sites such as Instagram, Twitter or Facebook. So removing comment section from news sites will not stop the hate speech as this could be done freely on any of the other platforms. You are never going to get away from hate speech completely but I do think limiting same by using AI could help in reducing same.

__label__Evidence	gender-neutral language should be adoppted in todays society where peoples sex is self determined and more fluid, because it avoids offence or discrimination

__label__Evidence	compulsory voting ensures that our leaders reflect the will of all people, not just those who were able/motivated enough to make it to the polls.

__label__Evidence	It's only anecdotal evidence, but I have noticed in the high schools in my area that the children from migrants are more able to participate in after-school activities when their language is developed further. Children, of course, still go to school on a daily basis, which means that they automatically are taking part in language lessons. However, seeing the positive results in language learning in these children, I can imagine that their parents would benefit in the same way if they were given the opportunity to follow language lessons (ideally low-budget/free).

__label__Evidence	the olympic games are a waste of money and time and should be abolished
__label__Evidence	In principle, I would be in favor of a European army, but I would tie it to a reform of European decision-making (majority or 2/3 majority).

__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Evidence	we should ban the use of child actors since it puts so much pressure on them. they should be growing up with a stable life and just enjoy being a kid.
__label__Position	This conversation seems to be pointless as our opinions will probably never be heard by those who are in control and authority and by big government who controls the people. They are the ones that need to hear and listen to the people through forums and discussions

__label__Position	people should be taught how to be kind and the implications of how their words could affect other people.
__label__Evidence	we should ban human cloning as it will only cause huge issues when you have a bunch of the same humans running around all acting the same.
__label__Evidence	Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles do not emit greenhouse gases. This helps to fight climate change. As many countries are opting for energy transition, clean hydrogen fuel vehicles along with other alternative fuel vehicles can pave the way to sustainable transportation. Also, as these vehicles do not emit greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, they can cut air pollution to a great extent.
__label__Evidence	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Evidence	whaling provides food and fuel for many people
__label__Evidence	we should not adopt libertarianism because total individuality would create chaos.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Position	Newspapers should have a clear indication of what they consider hate speech to be and what the consequences of posting hate speech on the platform are. Most sites require you to have an account in order to able to comment and you have to submit some personal information to create that account. The newspaper site should monitor comments and remove hate comments from the site and if you have been noted to be a serial hate commenter then your personal information used to create the account can be used to contact you for re-education purposes. This however, should come with a disclaimer so that people can know what they are getting themselve into.
__label__Evidence	I think EU bureaucrats and politicians should set an example for the rest of, Merkle in particular. They should also donate 30% of their wages to them.
__label__Position	Put in word blocks
__label__Evidence	We should ban the Church of Scientology as it does not behave in an open and transparent manner, and therefore causes issues in society.
__label__Position	Just pay moderators

__label__Evidence	we should abolish the olympic games because the pressure placed on athletes can cause mental health issues
__label__Evidence	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.

__label__Position	If you are ready to harm the nature by using technology then get ready to find a solution or alternative to nature if possible to protect the climate and environment.
__label__Evidence	This would also encourage others to speak up more without sounding hateful.
__label__Evidence	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	We should ban biometric mass surveillance in the EU
__label__Evidence	Then what happens to those who cannot afford to buy new vehicles and what about all the oil producing companies and businesses that will be ruined?

__label__Evidence	we should not abolish zoos because they are helping out endangered species that would otherwise be extinct if they went back into the wild now.
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Evidence	we should adopt a multi-party system because it makes it so that there is naturally more of a choice
__label__Position	Indian government should increase the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years
__label__Position	Research shows that letting comments proliferate with little oversight is a “dangerous recipe,” Andincivility and negative comments can have a long-term impact. Certain commenting software use algorithms meant to flag problematic comments, but machines can only do so much. Should newspapers really be spending already depleted resources on monitoring comments?
__label__Evidence	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Evidence	we don't subsidize other fields so why should we subsidize journalism

__label__Evidence	factory farming allows for cheaper meat production costs thus enabling those on low incomes to be able to afford meat.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Evidence	our schools need to nurture and protect all aspects of our children, including prayer and religion, and children should never be prohibited from praying in school.

__label__Evidence	it will give a stronger representation of the electorate.
__label__Evidence	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Evidence	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	People should be members with addresses checked

__label__Evidence	it can become confusing when voting on a multi-party system
__label__Position	Hate speech will forever be a problem in society and its up to the newspapers website to make sure they publish newsworthy news that even if they come across negative comments, they know that on their side their story is true and there a no loopholes
__label__Evidence	Protected classes can be addressed properly by preferred terms. Reduces fighting over "political" issues instead of the subject at hand
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Evidence	targeted killing uses expertise to eliminate those that are extreme threats, not only to our government, but to the global governing bodies.
__label__Evidence	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Evidence	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Evidence	prostitution is often associated with drug abuse and other crimes, and legalising it would send out completely the wrong message.
__label__Evidence	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Evidence	I don't agree. This would infringe on free speech. Rather have guidelines and censor any comments that promote hate speech.
__label__Evidence	if it against their will people will choose randomly and it will negate the choices of others

__label__Evidence	Testing of nuclear weapons causes pollution and destruction
__label__Evidence	Letting the Rohingya go back to the place where they do not get recognition means more loss of human lives, and to a greater extent. The population of the Rohingya is 1.1 million, and if the violence and torture continues on them, then there will be no person left in the community.
__label__Evidence	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Evidence	people should be able to go to school and better themselves without having to pay back thousands of dollars when they graduate.
__label__Evidence	we must not prohibit the use of child actors because it goes against the right to work. children under the supervision of their parents can develop their artistic talent without affecting their personal growth
__label__Evidence	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Evidence	too much parties are dangerous for cohesion.
__label__Evidence	school unifoorm creates a sense of community and takes away some aspects that can lead to bullying
__label__Evidence	No more non-European immigration. The native Europeans have said NO.
__label__Position	i do not agree with the method of doxxing people. hate speech has always existed, it is now on a more global scale because the world is more centralised as a result of social media. i believe the solution is censorship and moderation which sites like reddit and youtube already preactise.
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Position	My concern is how we efine hate speech vs expressing differing views. However we also have to be aware of the damage publishing incorrect facts can be.
__label__Evidence	I agree with this statement
__label__Evidence	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Evidence	human cloning is unethical. what would happen to the clones once they were created? harvest their organs and then what? euthanize them like garbage?
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Evidence	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Evidence	be responsible of your words
__label__Position	position
__label__Evidence	Newspapers are read by various demographics and have different types of people from different angles reading different ones, so a comment section does seem like it shouldn't be necessary
__label__Evidence	Yes, but the tax should be progressive per capita. This will ensure that we tax mostly overuse of resources and avoid increasing wealth inequality of the poor.
__label__Evidence	the organ trade should be legalized because it would result in the suppression of the black market for organs and therfore be safer for both donors and recipients
__label__Evidence	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Evidence	but the newspaper cannot be liable for how people respond,considering that most website are visited by adults with responsibilities.
__label__Evidence	Allowing cosmetic surgery for minors creates more risk for doctors and therefore more frivolous lawsuits and money spent on malpractice insurance. This is bad for the healthcare system overall.
__label__Evidence	Absolutely. I think there is a thin line between disallowing free speech and blocking what others may see as hate speech. The trick is finding a balance between the two. The newspaper must avoid being seen as blocking views that may differ with them.
__label__Evidence	Executive level employees have worked hard to achieve the level they have and should be compensated for this.
__label__Evidence	Newspaper websites should be responsible, if they do not control the atmosphere of their commentary they will be believed to agree to any negative comments made.
__label__Evidence	governments in this way seek to prioritize their needs and whims at the time of reaching power
__label__Evidence	I think if saying something out loud in a public place would get you arrested, you should not be allowed to type it online.
__label__Evidence	Being able to track down those who have posted hate speech would be useful in putting a stop to them and may discourage those who like to post things anonymously from posting in the first place
__label__Evidence	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Evidence	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Evidence	cannabis should be legalized with the same limitations as alcohol
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Position	Simply removing the comment section on newspapers websites seems too simple to be effective. Hate speech are allowed by the fact that people are fairly anonymous on Internet. So a solution would be to implement some kind of ID check before creating a profile allowing to comment. If someone knows they can be traced back, their speech will also be not hateful.
__label__Position	I think the people should be given a choice whether or not they would like the comment section removes because they are the ones reading the news paper.
__label__Evidence	cannabis is a drug. drugs are meant to be illegal. there's no reason to take this slippery step to make it legal.
__label__Evidence	we should not ban school prayer because for those in a religious community, their religion and therefore prayer is central to their lives and should be included in every aspect of it.
__label__Evidence	making a child work as an actor deprives them of childhood experiences and interactions.
__label__Evidence	an owner of a company should be allowed to make as much money as possible
__label__Evidence	the risks of cosmetic surgery are not worth the small gains that result from it
__label__Position	By the whole nature of the newspapers removing this ability, who is to say the newspaper itself could be potentially spreading hate news?
__label__Evidence	private military companies are a business like any other and are subject to national and international regulations
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't ban algorithmic trading because there is nothing wrong with it. if a person wants to use algorithms to trade instead of making investment decisions based on emotion, we should allow it.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Evidence	nuclear weapons help keep peace. it's an assurance policy. everyone knows that everyone loses if nuclear war breaks out. this keeps countries in line so as not to provoke a nuclear attack.
__label__Position	We cannot! As simply as that
__label__Evidence	we should adopt atheism until it can be proven that god is real.
__label__Evidence	human cloning could lead to people replacing themselves with images themselves. this could lead to the end of human evolution which could make us more vulnerable to disease.
__label__Evidence	These comments are on their sites and it is their responsibility to control them. Some comments may be discriminating and therefore do not belong on the site
__label__Evidence	there are more important things to spend public funds on such as health care, housing and education.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	That's true. Most social media companies are already using AI to detect and remove hate speech. Here's an article about this: https://www.newsy.com/stories/artificial-intelligence-is-used-to-track-down-hate-speech/
__label__Evidence	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Evidence	Legalizing prostitution encourages the objectification of female bodies, which encourages sexual harassment and commodification.
__label__Evidence	we should legalize prostitution because if someone really wants to use those services, they should have the right to do so. we can just regulate it.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Evidence	a multi-party system allows for more ideas, more candidates, more voters turning out.
__label__Evidence	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Evidence	executive compensation encourages them to work for their pay
__label__Evidence	Educating people (such as making it mandatory in the school system) on how to reverse climate change can give people the option to make positive changes to the situation.
__label__Evidence	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Evidence	Unfortunately, in our society, a healthy person is not profitable. Pharma is a big business, doctors are being paid for prescribing drugs. Modern healthcare should be preventive. Doctors should be encouraged and paid for curing people and keeping them healthy. Good quality healthcare should be accessible in every part of the world and should be free as there is nothing more important than human life.
__label__Position	Use technology to monitor and block users
__label__Position	Sorry, I intended to add to the above Guardian-article-link, that it surprised me because it suggested that, to some extent - and in some forums - online commenting is not anonymous. I was quite heartened to read that a few of those commenters interviewed had actually been temporarily banned at one time or another, for some comment they made, and that actually this had greatly affected them. Possibly this is just the attitude of this people who actually take responsibility for their own comments and are willing to be identified, though. I don't imagine that the people who make death threats or rape threats are quite so distressed by the prospect of being thrown out of a forum.
__label__Evidence	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Evidence	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Evidence	embryonic stem cell research helps save and improve lives.
__label__Position	The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is interestingly tackled in this article
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Evidence	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Evidence	Guns are designed to kill people, we should be doing everything possible to destroy them and stop their production to save lives, allowing people to keep and bear arms does the absolute opposite of this.
__label__Evidence	safe spaces give a place of sanctuary to those that may be in a vulnerable state and a safe place is the only accessible option to gather oneself together in safety.
__label__Evidence	the old days of labeling careers as a mailman, etc are sexist and outdated. women can do anything men can, and adopting a gender neutral language would reinforce that concept.
__label__Evidence	Safe spaces are necessary for many people to have strong mental and emotional health, and we should advocate to protect this health just like we advocate for healthcare for physical ailments.
__label__Evidence	cosmetic surgery is pointless and takes doctors away from other important fields such as family care
__label__Evidence	we should adopt gender-neutral language because it will create a society where men are not more powerful and important than women.
__label__Evidence	I agree somewhat.
__label__Position	Algorithms for detecting hate speech are not yet as effective as human moderation, but I believe in combination with human moderation it can be a very useful tool to flag only potential comments for manual approval, rather than every comment. https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0221152
__label__Position	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.

__label__Evidence	subsidizing wikipedia would lead to bias in its articles and slanted information
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't adopt atheism because it can scare people away from religion.
__label__Evidence	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	Enforcing what to eat to people is against principle of freedom - even if we talk about dietary options
__label__Evidence	It's a good idea, but too many get giddy at trying to break rules and in doing so, ruin things.
__label__Evidence	student loans can be expensive and put young people in debt
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	another way to curb hatespeech is using empathy, as using humour can "fuel the flame"- https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2021/12/empathy-based-counter-speech-can-reduce-hate-speech.html
__label__Evidence	kids should be in school to learn. no one should force religion on them.
__label__Evidence	agree
__label__Evidence	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Evidence	we should abolish intellectual property rights to break to the barriers if innovation, barring people from building on and improving ideas is counter productive
__label__Evidence	pride parades offer a sense of community and support.
__label__Evidence	pride parades can show everyone that we tolerate everyone
__label__Evidence	Comments are still there for free speech.
__label__Evidence	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Evidence	children should be at school and not working. we do not allow children to work in any other way and acting should be no different.
__label__Evidence	No, Europe is not a colony. Immigration has been devastating. Public EU officials who support immigration should be named and the European people must be given a democratic opportunity to remove them from positions of power and influence.
__label__Position	We should ban storing nuclear waste within Europe’s territory
__label__Position	Computers should be able to detect hate speech if there is any and report and remove that comment whinin minutes of posting it
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Position	Research shows that letting comments proliferate with little oversight is a “dangerous recipe,” Andincivility and negative comments can have a long-term impact. Certain commenting software use algorithms meant to flag problematic comments, but machines can only do so much. Should newspapers really be spending already depleted resources on monitoring comments?
__label__Evidence	The way to circumvent abuse of flagging is to create consequences for it. Being banned from the comments section in increments of time until someone is eventually permanently banned for too many infractions
__label__Evidence	I agree
__label__Position	(https://mediaengagement.org/research/how-the-public-views-deletion-of-offensive-comments/)
__label__Evidence	Absolutely agree with you;removing the comments section will achieve nothing as it will drown out even sound contributions to the discussion(s).
__label__Evidence	space exploration isn't necessary so the money could go to much more useful things such as education for children and providing health care for people.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars are dangerous because they are operated by a computer which can malfunction or be hacked.
__label__Evidence	cosmetic surgery is a choice between a doctor and a patient, and laws should not be made that infringe on those choices.
__label__Evidence	Current concerns about rule of law infringements are simply being brushed off as 'national matters'. If this continues, how can the EU assume authority to promote democracy abroad? More strict and enforceable minimum standards must be introduced, under clearly increasing penalties for non-compliance. If shared values and democracy are indeed a requisite to be a part of the EU, then continued adherence should be a precondition to remain a part of it.
__label__Evidence	The EU must ensure that all products entering the EU are grown, manufactured, and grown to certain standards. This should ensure that people in the south have a dignified life. To achieve this goal might be helpful to have European Law state that all imports should have certain labels such as Fair Trade, etc.
__label__Evidence	I don't think banning people from commenting would lead them to do something more powerful or extreme.
__label__Evidence	All refugee camps should be closed. And illegals moved back to the last country they left.

__label__Evidence	human cloning gives the chance for individuals to have a child that might not otherwise be able to
__label__Evidence	fast food is one of the leading causes of obesity.
__label__Evidence	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Evidence	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Evidence	judicial activism is dangerous in that it allows for personal opinion to possibly get in the way of true justice. personal opinion clouding what is law should not be allowed.
__label__Evidence	factory farming is a way of producing cheap meat. without it poorer people may not be able to afford it and may become malnourished.

__label__Evidence	collectivism is a communist strategy and we must reject
__label__Position	We should adopt a single migration policy.

__label__Evidence	most people can't afford to go to college, and we don't want them to graduate with massive debts
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars have already caused multiple fatalities and are being used on public roads right now without being adequately tested. the makers are literally using human lives to beta test their products.
__label__Evidence	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Evidence	I agree
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars are not able to react to specific scenarios where decisions must be made.
__label__Evidence	Zoos are places that protect and breed animals that would otherwise become extinct.

__label__Evidence	cosmetic surgery encourages people to change things that don't need changing.
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't abolish the three strikes law because it is necessary to ensure society understands the ramifications of repeated ill behavior. three felonies is just about enough as far as i'm concerned.
__label__Evidence	The protection of fundamental and human rights, decent work, and the high quality of public services for all must be an integral part of trade and investment policy reform.
__label__Position	I think that is very difficult to control. Maybe you would need a team of moderators constantly monitoring alongside bots to catch hate speech. Hate speech is unacceptable and should be addressed, however difficult to manage.
__label__Evidence	legalizing prostitution would be the thin end of a wedge - all sorts of unsavoury activities are centered around the sex industry.
__label__Evidence	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Evidence	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Evidence	we don't need a zero-tolerance policy that punishes students harshly for small things

__label__Evidence	nuclear weapons provide us security in times of war.
__label__Evidence	I don't agree with removing the space for views to be aired. That is an important part of challenging and changing opinion. I agree that hate speech should not be tolerated so finding the users and punishing them is key.

__label__Evidence	We should not adopt libertarianism because we need the government to provide essential services that are unprofitable.
__label__Evidence	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Evidence	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Evidence	While investigating crimes, there will be a need to access the payment data. If the data is stored abroad, it is very difficult to take permission from that country for access to the data. This causes delays in solving crimes. If the data is stored here within our country, this problem will be avoided.
__label__Position	At the end of the day hate speech is not hate speech to everyone, I ended up reaching the conclusion that everyone has their own opinion about everything, So to want to filter or block comments is not freedom of speech, but building a sensitive society that is scared of debates and confronting serious issues, Its up to the receiver of the comment to act on it or not. Cyber bullying is a different story.

__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	In general, companies provide several benefits to employees such as provident fund, health insurance, etc. So, they feel it is unfair when their employees focus their energy and time on a second job, which doesn’t provide any of those benefits.

__label__Evidence	cannabis can impair drivers and cause accidents.
__label__Evidence	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Evidence	all citizens should be compelled to vote to voice their opinion on who should be our elected leaders. apathy in selecting our political leaders is detrimental to our society.
__label__Evidence	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.

__label__Evidence	it is a good measure, since our youth currently lack responsibility and discipline, and with this we favor more that ability
__label__Position	There could also be a disclaimer added before one can see other comments which encourage readers to fact-check and be mindful of what they're reading, while also having moderators.
__label__Evidence	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Evidence	you cannot push another country just because you don't approve of their behaviors
__label__Evidence	Reduced aggression could lead to less retaliation. If an idea/thought is presented in a balanced way, then a respondent may hopefully be inclined to respond accordingly.

__label__Evidence	The country of origin should absolutely be the most important criterion for deciding who we let into our countries. 160 Frenchman would still be alive if we put the welfare of our own above people whose countries the Americans have bombed to shreds.
__label__Evidence	Can be misunderstood
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't give money to a site where anyone can edit articles to give false information.
__label__Evidence	Legalizing cannabis will increase recreational use which could lead to more car accidents caused by people driving while under the influence.
__label__Position	I think rather than removing the option to comment/debate below an article, there could be moderators and hate speech buttons and bots to keep hate speech at bay.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Evidence	telemarketing is intrusive, annoying and violates privacy
__label__Evidence	pride parades show acceptance and we need more of that
__label__Evidence	if a government is doing something wrong like apartheid we should not be trading with them as it shows support for that behaviour.
__label__Evidence	it is a decision that only parents can make until they are old enough to decide
__label__Evidence	While I agree that we're all entitled to an opinion, I think it's important we understand the difference between hateful comments that are for hurtful purposes rather than an opinion that does not generate more hate
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Evidence	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Evidence	There is nothing wrong with a healthy discussion from opposing sides of an argument. The only issue is when people are posting hate speech. What is hate speech needs to be clearly understood https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech
__label__Evidence	wikipedia is the largest online encyclopedia in the world and we must ensure its proper functioning
__label__Evidence	we should ban the use of child actors because it can hurt them mentally and emotionally for the rest of their lives.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	I love the suggestions about having real life moderators and user flagging comments for moderation. It's very effective on Meta.

__label__Evidence	Telemarketing involves lower overhead costs and thus saves companies money.
__label__Evidence	If newspapers did not allow interaction and went back to old school 1 way news, they would die out, nobody uses that anynore
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Evidence	subsidization would cause biased reporting
__label__Evidence	true there are valid criticism that are necessary
__label__Evidence	wikipedia allows people to say whatever they want on a topic and does not have to be true or provable.
__label__Evidence	it is essential that environmental concerns and sustainability are the foundation of any treaty with our European Union!
__label__Evidence	This would create issues of illegibility and would only create more confusion as to the user's intent when the comment was made.
__label__Evidence	Surely it is possible to have a free exchange of ideas without resorting to hate speech. There must be a level of basic human respect that can be maintained.
__label__Evidence	Allows for more discourse
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Evidence	we should abolish the three-strikes laws because they have no effect in detering crime
__label__Evidence	We must move towards full co-decision power for the European Parliament and the abolition of unanimity for climate, energy, social affairs, and taxation policies.
__label__Evidence	some people classify themselves as gender neutral and we should respect them with our language
__label__Evidence	I agree, people should have the newspaper identify hate speech, but also the newspaper needs to actually evaluate the reported comments
__label__Evidence	The majority of driverless cars are going to be Electric Vehicles (EV's) which will help in decreasing the pollution level in the country, which is also one of the major issues the country is facing.
__label__Evidence	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Position	5G services should be available across India
__label__Evidence	students are not yet adults, and circumstances are unique for each child.
__label__Position	In my opinion,scrapping comments sections is not the best way to go about dealing with the issue(s) around hate speech on news platforms. The sensible thing to do is to monitor comment sections for hate speech in order for it to be removed and the evidence suggests that the public is in support of such measures(https://mediaengagement.org/research/how-the-public-views-deletion-of-offensive-comments/),granted the moderators, whether it's a human or AI, remain neutral.
__label__Evidence	people have the right to use their bodies in any way they choose.
__label__Position	Having read through the opinions of others, my stance has not completely changed. It is important to censor comments, freedom of speech does not always equate to disrespecting the views and opinions of others. While I agree that comments should be censored, I do not agree that every comment should be removed. As mentioned before, a system can be implemented that removes comments with certain words, thus making the comment section a safe space for all who use it.
__label__Evidence	Genuine hate speech will be ignored with that view
__label__Evidence	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Evidence	zoos should be abolished so that animals can thrive in a setting that allows them to roam free
__label__Evidence	embryonic stem cell research should be subsidized because it only requires a small amount of cells because of the fast replication rate
__label__Position	I personnally think hate speech shouldnt even be discussed being a fact of the topic or not. Reason being every has easy access on newspapers you wouldnt want teenagers to be reading hate speech o newspapapers.
__label__Evidence	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	Research shows that letting comments proliferate with little oversight is a “dangerous recipe,” Andincivility and negative comments can have a long-term impact. Certain commenting software use algorithms meant to flag problematic comments, but machines can only do so much. Should newspapers really be spending already depleted resources on monitoring comments?
__label__Evidence	These days, many songs and dances in movies are not supposed to be seen by children. Singing and dancing to these obscene songs will exploit children’s innocence and creates confusion in their minds.
__label__Evidence	we need to stop all the shootings that are happening and abolishing the right to keep and bear arms is a good start
__label__Evidence	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Evidence	we should ban cosmetic surgery because the patients might get cancer when it is done over and over again
__label__Evidence	Agreed. And many of these potential solutions are also not successful at limiting harmful content (https://slate.com/technology/2018/05/the-facebook-upvote-and-downvote-experiment-is-a-bust.html). As long as the platform is comforming to the laws of the country then it should not have to introduce further measures to limit hate speech at the expense of preventing free and open discussion.
__label__Evidence	Due to the benefits of striking first with a nuclear weapon in times of war, even small conflicts can escalate into world endangering conflicts.
__label__Evidence	embryonic stem cell research is immoral.
__label__Evidence	we should not place any restrictions on freedom of speech, many of the restrictions are arbitrary and unnecessary such as the "gingerbread man" becoming the "gingerbread person"
__label__Evidence	An austerity regime is very important during economically stressful times.
__label__Evidence	economic sanctions provide an easy way to protest and can easily be reversed when situations change.
__label__Evidence	I agree that there should be technologies that are able to scan and the comment section to detect and flag any offensive/derogatory words in the comments before the comments are published.
__label__Position	i do not believe that speech should be restricted just like that. what constitues as hate speech? and what constitues as fair criticism? i believe the people today have become very sensitive and cannot critically think because of censorship of important thoughts and ideas. if we dont censor oversexualisation and crude language, why should we censor criticism? i believe hate speech which incites harm and calls for negativity flat out should be what is flagged by the administrators or moderators and the people should vote on it, not just one person.
__label__Evidence	It would also not allow the writer to see if the public like what he/she is writing.
__label__Evidence	everyone should have a right to be happy.
__label__Position	According to https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=a57e541240ed3b9bJmltdHM9MTY2NjIyNDAwMCZpZ3VpZD0xNDgwZDNmYy03ZTI1LTYzYzMtMGZiZC1kZDNiN2ZkZDYyOTAmaW5zaWQ9NTI0NA&ptn=3&hsh=3&fclid=1480d3fc-7e25-63c3-0fbd-dd3b7fdd6290&psq=how+to+reduce+hate+speech+online&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly90aGVjb252ZXJzYXRpb24uY29tL2EtYmV0dGVyLXdheS10by1yZWd1bGF0ZS1vbmxpbmUtaGF0ZS1zcGVlY2gtcmVxdWlyZS1zb2NpYWwtbWVkaWEtY29tcGFuaWVzLXRvLWJlYXItYS1kdXR5LW9mLWNhcmUtdG8tdXNlcnMtMTYzODA4&ntb=1 The Act creates a complaints-based system for removing harmful material, and in some cases the eSafety commissioner has the power to block sites. It also has a wide remit in terms of its coverage of a variety of online services. Yet, it only tackles a few specific types of harm, not the full spectrum of harmful speech.
__label__Evidence	This will cause readers not to engage with the website or newspapers
__label__Evidence	Absolutely right! If the eurocrats cared about what the people want, they'd ask them.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Evidence	pride parades are important to understanding others
__label__Evidence	we should adopt a zero-tolerance policy in schools then all the children will more likely behave
__label__Evidence	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Position	Hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by educating people about the consequences of hate speech and what they can do to someone else.
__label__Evidence	Who guards the guardians?
__label__Evidence	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Evidence	if you are not required to wear a uniform, you are free to choose clothing styles that are more favorable to your body type and coloring, which allows you to look your best
__label__Position	Adultery should be criminalized
__label__Evidence	The moderator needs to not be too strict
__label__Evidence	It is nice to read things you agree with, and proabaly helps sell newspapers
__label__Evidence	we should not because it would cost the country millions of pounds and raise everyone's taxes, so the cost of living would go up.
__label__Evidence	In Germany, the President of the Executive is not elected by the people directly either. The reason for this is the horrible experience during the Third Reich. The Parliament - as the only constitutional institution being directly elected - has a stronger stand if the President is not elected directly. However I definitely support, that the Parliament becomes stronger and more influential.
__label__Evidence	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Evidence	Esperanto is politically neutral: it is not used by any European nation. Although there is some culture connected to the language, there is no political or economic power imposing it. Also, where English is connected to the US, Canada, Australia, and other countries, Esperanto would be a truly European language.
__label__Evidence	other places can provide information for free so why should wikipedia get money for doing the same thing?
__label__Evidence	blocking certain words could automatically delete comments that are not necessarily hateful to another person
__label__Evidence	the three strikes law punishes people to harshly for minor crimes. they shouldn't have to spend the rest of their lives in prison unless they are crimes that harm another person.
__label__Position	use an algorithm to filter out words such as slurs and offensive phrases but also have a person who's looks over the comment in order to make sure they comply with hate speech legislation
__label__Evidence	we should end mandatory retirement because it should be up to each individual what age they feel they are unable to work any longer
__label__Evidence	For a better migration policy, a European mission could be created to welcome migrants from the coasts of Libya and Tunisia. People welcomed in the centers in North Africa will be re-distributed to the countries of the Union. Are you insane?
__label__Evidence	climate change can only be successfully addressed on a global scale, especially in emerging countries that will be responsible for most of the greenhouse gas emissions in a few decades otherwise. But to convince them to grow green we have to acknowledge that we are denying them the way to build their economy as we did in the past 200 years. So we must support emerging countries in their transition to a green economy.
__label__Evidence	i agree. it is not a permanent solution
__label__Evidence	We cannot invest trillions in an attempt to reverse climate change, without first knowing that is possible, manageable and achievable in a reasonable amount of time
__label__Evidence	Anonymity empowers people and might make them more willing to express extreme opinions. Verified profiles reduces anonymity.
__label__Evidence	they are environmentally friendly and can help minimize traffic congestion.
__label__Evidence	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Evidence	cloning would have strict regulations on how to handle clones and ethical dilemmas. scientific advancements made while working towards cloning can advance the human race.
__label__Evidence	This still poses an issue with what people think is acceptable. You run the risk of people joining in as opposed to call it out.
__label__Evidence	Newspapers have a duty of care to the reader so they should be vigilant
__label__Evidence	Migrant workers are overrepresented in the most precarious jobs, they are too often underpaid, they work under intolerable working conditions, and live in horrendous housing facilities. Workers are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. And they continue to encounter inhumane working and living conditions because effective enforcement is lacking. Trade unions are often not allowed on worksites with precarious jobs and migrant workers can therefore not adequately be informed about their labor and trade union rights. Third-country nationals are even more vulnerable than EU migrant/mobile workers.
__label__Position	We should implement a legislation on aquatic animal welfare
__label__Evidence	Veganism is a choice, it should not be forced - especially to children
__label__Evidence	three-strikes laws help people realize that what they did was wrong and change their ways before they end up in jail for life.
__label__Evidence	t is absurd that such an EU policy about migration is lacking.
__label__Evidence	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Evidence	we live in an open society where freedom of religious expression is allowed. to go against that would be a betrayal of western values.
__label__Evidence	human cloning can help doctors find a cure for illnesses we otherwise won't be able to survive
__label__Evidence	zoos bring a lot of money in which can be spent on animal research and stop their extinction.
__label__Position	Completely doing away with the comment section would not be beneficial to the readers experience as reading other peoples thoughts is what sets online media apart from offline media. It plays a role in keeping the discussion going. It would be smart to rather monitor comments to ensure hate speech or utterances of a vile nature are greatly reduced through the use of some sort of algorithm that picks up on problematic words and deletes comments or it being done manually by people who will moderate the comment section.
__label__Evidence	I think a very good transportation system within European cities is very much desirable. There is not enough space for many parking lots anyway, electro-cars won't be able to replace common cars, and urban spaces have to become greener. In order for many people to accept that the use of cars will have been a thing of the past, they should be offered very good alternatives in the future and, hopefully, appreciate green mobility through good public transport within urban areas.
__label__Evidence	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Evidence	there is no reason to adopt gender-neutral language as the fact that genders do exist and the differences do matter is indisputable!
__label__Position	State that the editor has the final choice to print or not.
__label__Evidence	factory farming cuts too many health and safety corners as opposed to smaller family farms, this leads to potentially unsafe and unhealthy products.
__label__Evidence	This movement has the potential to make more people embrace traditional Indian martial art forms like Kathi Samu, Musti Yudha, etc, and traditional dance forms and also healthy Indian snacks. And as a byproduct, this may result in creating some jobs.
__label__Position	I don't believe removing the comment section will help remove hate speech, but having a system that can track the device and the people that use that device can go a long way in removing trolls from a community platform and prevent them from becoming repeat offenders.
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Evidence	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Evidence	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Evidence	embryonic stem cell research has the potential to open up a whole new field of healthcare and medicine
__label__Evidence	I agree
__label__Position	We should legalize cannabis in the whole EU
__label__Evidence	i definately agree newspaper require multiple moderator who check every story before it gets published to the public

__label__Position	"The Heritage Council of Ireland recently run a course that reached 100 attendees and 70 waitlists) it was a huge success.

__label__Evidence	the right to keep and bear arms should not be abolished because it allows people to defend themselves
__label__Evidence	There are just so many options.
__label__Evidence	Criminal will feel the pain of the victim, if he is subjected to the same kind of harassment. Thereby, he may not commit the crime again in his life.
__label__Position	All comments would need to be vetted before being posted on the site.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars could prevent traffic jams and accidents.
__label__Evidence	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Evidence	we need to subsidize space exploration so we can find somewhere for the human race to go when we finally get done destroying our planet.
__label__Evidence	Hate comments can manifest into something much worse and is absolutely neccesary to destroy the source of the hate.
__label__Evidence	we should abolish the three-strikes laws because i don't think people should be given more than one chance, they are grown adults and know right from wrong
__label__Evidence	This will provide more police powers to the central government. The provision of naming individuals as terrorists can be misused. For example, recently several civil activists are termed as Urban Naxals. If anyone opposes the government, they will be vulnerable to be framed as terrorists. Because this amendment made it easier to label anyone as a terrorist.
__label__Evidence	legalizing prostitution would allow for regulations and benefits that would help sex workers via offering protection with rights granted to legal employment as well as financial prosperity.
__label__Evidence	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.

__label__Evidence	Hydrogen vehicles are much quieter than fossil fuel-based vehicles. So, they can reduce noise pollution too.
__label__Position	It is only possible t have the comment section removed in order to relive audience from seeing hate peech under posted magazines. It may infring frree speech, but prodominety shall remove hate speech which can be scientifically tomrmenting to the mind.
__label__Evidence	three strikes is too many in some cases. if people know they have three chances, they will not be deterred from using that to their advantage.
__label__Position	Is it really hate speech or is it just an opinion that we don't want to hear?
__label__Evidence	everyone has a right to celebrate and show pride. otherwise it would be discrimination.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	We should not ban cosmetic surgery as people should be allowed to do what they want with their bodies.
__label__Evidence	True, but not every criticism is valid
__label__Evidence	we don't know the long term effects of cannabis use because there have never been adequate studies. until there are scientific studies done to ensure long term safety, cannabis should not be legalized.
__label__Evidence	targeting killing is barbaric and exists outside the bounds of government.
__label__Evidence	It is unacceptable. Every nation has the right to organize its own prosecution system and no foreign prosecutor should be allowed to operate in independent states, it is a threat to the sovereignty of the member states.

__label__Evidence	the olympic games are a hugely expensive enterprise to host, and history is littered with countries left financially broken in the aftermath.
__label__Evidence	Abortion kills a human being. It can be justified only in very rare cases.
__label__Position	I'm having trouble reading the comments on here. The page keeps moving. I can only confirm what I have already written that comments should be allowed but would have to be moderated in some way. I don't know how this would happen, since there could be too many comments for a human to police. Perhaps a combination of a bot checking comments and a real human might work. I don't think you will completely eliminate hate speech because everyone has different life experiences. It should be up to the individual to realise what makes sense instead of enforcing a kind of nanny state. People should be able to make up their own minds. The issue happens when you become the target and how it can affect you personally. However, I still believe that we need freedom of speech and the only way to stop it is to police the comments and discourage by criminalising it to empower victims. This article looks at both sides:- https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation
__label__Position	you ca reduce hate speech by adding an ai bot that can distinguishly remove between violent words from a comment. A report button is as useful which can allow for moderators to review comments and decide on the level of polarization.
__label__Position	We should allocate 3% GDP for research and innovation by 2035
__label__Evidence	It has been shown that easily accessible prostitution decreases violence against women more broadly by allowing men safe and consensual outlets.

__label__Evidence	space exploration is needed to further our nations scientific knowledge. it should be supported by government. there is no profit in it but is vital to our nation and should be undertaken with public dollars.
__label__Evidence	I have never heard anyone talking in Europe about world supremacy. So it seems kind of pointless that this is a goal of EU policy.
__label__Evidence	Mostly agree. Only if a country violates basic human rights its vote in the EU should be suspended and/or financial sanctions imposed, tailored to target the offending government and its supporters. But such a country should NOT be excluded from the EU, because that would mostly harm the opposition which is likely to be more EU-friendly.
__label__Evidence	it is basically a cult that steals money from naive people.
__label__Evidence	we should not ban the church of scientology because in this country everyone has the right to freely practice whatever religion they want.

__label__Evidence	factory farming is an efficient way of providing affordable for for people. without it the price of meat will escalate and will be beyond the pocket of many people.
__label__Position	To be honest, I am torn, I think that good newspapers (good referring to the quality of their investigating and reporting) should not need a comment section. They should report the facts and as such, comments I feel are not needed, the goal is to provide information and comments are mostly opinions. What is the goal of the comments?
__label__Position	Alternative medicine should be more accepted
__label__Evidence	Would make people think before posting
__label__Evidence	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.

__label__Evidence	Three strikes laws are unnecessary because states already have ways of punishing recidivism more harshly.
__label__Evidence	it would save taxpayers from paying for a person to have a room and food for the rest of their natural life if thats their sentence.
__label__Position	There is no cure for hate speech, but there is a way to stand up against it. Speak out against hate speech - fight racism and bigotry with love, empathy, compassion, and strength. We may not be able to eliminate hatred entirely, but the more steps we can take to educate and support human beings, and speak out against injustice, the better this world will become. Resources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech
__label__Evidence	we should not abolish the three-strikes laws because the criminal deserves what they did and justice must be done unto them

__label__Evidence	private military companies are nothing but hired guards. a company should be able to hire them because they provide a service that is needed.
__label__Evidence	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.

__label__Evidence	gender nuetral language fits in with the progressive agenda.
__label__Evidence	we cannot abolish intellectual property rights because artists and scientists need to have their ideas and innovations protected so that they can earn a living in their fields

__label__Evidence	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.

__label__Evidence	judicial activism relies too heavily upon personal opinion and leads to bias.
__label__Position	Peer reviews of reporting comments should be checked by at least two moderators with two different background in order to facilitate the process and prevent review bombing instead of policing hate speeach

__label__Position	Companies should fight moonlighting

__label__Evidence	space exploration should not be subsidized because it is not affordable. there is not enough money available in mostcountries to even support health care and security without space exploration too.
__label__Evidence	But allowing hate speech to flourish would mean that comment space would be filled with spammers and hate speech and it would become useless.
__label__Evidence	it is important to ensure that the public is able to receive the news.
__label__Evidence	The cost of training new employees can be incredibly high, and policies of mandatory retirement force businesses to waste their fungible resources rather than keeping competent older individuals employed.
__label__Position	I don't think removing the comment spaceis a good idea, people should still be given a platform where they can voice themselves out. Having a team look through the comments and find those that include hate speach and remove them and maybe ban the people whith hatespeach comments from ever posting comments again.
__label__Evidence	we need these people but not if they are a nuisance and try to criticize our personal beliefs.
__label__Evidence	we should legalize organ trade because it will be better monitored than having organs being sold on the black market
__label__Position	By putting in a classing program that will read and class information as it enters. That way things will work nicely and we wont see more of hate speech
__label__Position	Climate change science is inconclusive.
__label__Evidence	We should subsidize journalism because we need to keep local journalism alive so people are aware of what is going on in their community, but small news papers are struggling the most.
__label__Evidence	we should ban private military companies because they are just hired hit men
__label__Evidence	sex selection is playing god, will create gender imbalances and create negative stereotypes concerning male/female preferences.
__label__Evidence	Having moderators filter out bad words or comments that contain hate speech would do so much good. This allows everybody to comment their opinion but remove those that are hateful and disrespectful.
__label__Position	Cricket should be declared the national game of India
__label__Evidence	more people would be able to get into journalism and there would therefore be more news stories available.
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	zoos prevent animals from returning to their natural habitats, forcing them into confinement and disregarding their instincts of living in the wild.

__label__Evidence	collectivism stops creativity and individual thought
__label__Evidence	missionary work is very dangerous for the people involved and provides little benefit to those being ministered to

__label__Position	We do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.
__label__Evidence	school prayer should be allowed in schools, as long as students get the choice of whether or not they want to participate.

__label__Evidence	School uniforms suppress students' freedom of expression, particularly if they otherwise wear religious garb.
__label__Evidence	private military companies are mercenaries who can harm our society for greed and we don't need them
__label__Position	It makes sense to use AI to monitor certain words that are going to cause offence.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Evidence	science is important and can be beneficial to society.
__label__Evidence	It is difficult to determine what is considered hate speech as everyone has their own biases
__label__Position	The way to avoid constant closure of the comments section is to use well-considered, human judgement by moderators back by explicit codes of conduct with examples. Some evidence of this approach:
__label__Evidence	Small, harmless cosmetic surgeries can do a lot for increasing a child's confidence and productivity.
__label__Evidence	We cannot afford a lost generation, so we need to invest in quality jobs and young people for our future!
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.

__label__Evidence	It is possible to use evidence based methods to apply this type of solution, then its a question of automationon
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Evidence	When prostitution is illegal, prostitutes are defenseless, and are often harassed and abused.
__label__Evidence	I feel like this would be the mos t ideal solution.

__label__Evidence	Turkey is an enemy. It uses this deal to make a threat. Stop it now and send patrols to the Greek border or welcome them.
__label__Evidence	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Evidence	Turkey is encroaching on EU territory, Russia is sending its army to the Ukrainian border, and what can we do? Nothing, because nobody is taking us seriously.

__label__Position	Comments need to be monitored.
__label__Evidence	people should be able to select the sex of the children so that they can balance their family the way they wish it to be.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	recent investigations consistently demonstrate a strong link between executions and reduced murder rates
__label__Evidence	factory farming creates health hazards and leads to an increase in pollution. overall it is bad for the environment
__label__Evidence	it could help support journalism and help people create compelling and quality articles and better coverage and less false or misleading headlines.
__label__Evidence	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Evidence	Religion has served its purpose of uniting people, setting up structures in society, and developing trust and cooperation. But in the 21st century, we are thriving towards objective realities, and religion is an inter-subjective reality and now the only thing it does is create differences in the world, brainwash people, develop animosity for other beliefs, and provide rituals that are just shortcuts to becoming a good person. (A Muslim may pray 5 times a day; a Hindu may pray daily for hours in temples; a Christian may go to church every day, but still, be involved in immoral activities).
__label__Position	There should be some filters to remove bad comments
__label__Evidence	we should not legalize prostitution because they spread too many deceases so we need to get rid of prostitution

__label__Evidence	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Evidence	people should be allowed to retire when they are ready

__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	moderating the comments
__label__Evidence	telemarketing is an unwarranted and intrusive breach of a person's privacy, selling useless goods and services not requested by the consumer.
__label__Evidence	I agree with this as it is important to allow freedom of speech, however, not to the detriment of others. There need to be acceptable guidelines.
__label__Evidence	Migrants depend on other countries' social systems.
__label__Evidence	child actors should be allowed to work and contribute their talents to society.
__label__Evidence	Whales are wonderfully intelligent creatures that don't deserve to be hunted in such a gruesome manner.
__label__Evidence	Mass migration is hybrid warfare directed against our stability. State actors, such as Morocco, Belarus and Turkey have already taken advantage of mass migration.
__label__Evidence	everyone should be allowed to practice their own faith wherever they are, many people rely on prayer to manage stressful situations such as exams and without prayer mental health issues are likely to increase.

__label__Position	We need to ensure improvements to the European Union's decision-making processes with increased transparency and accountability
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.

__label__Evidence	Migrants depend on other countries' social systems.
__label__Evidence	missionary work does not cause any harm as long as proper education is present on both sides.
__label__Position	Eliminating one's ability to express their opinions on a particular site does not change that opinion. They'll just move to their own echo-chamber elsewhere where it'll fester without being challenged. All that's needed is a reasonable degree of moderation to keep the discussion relatively civil where opponents can have their discussions out in the open.
__label__Position	Newspaper websites should have AI that auto flags bad comments
__label__Evidence	missionary work is risky to participate in.

__label__Evidence	Before we focus on ensuring that immigrants have nice conditions in the EU, we should first focus on ensuring that our own people can live respected lives in their own countries. Countries where they paid taxes and supported with their own labor. So that they are supported when they get ill, when they need help taking care of their kids and when they one day retire. EU still hasn't properly managed to achieve this in all member states. As such those member states should focus on repairing and improving the situation for their own people first and once those countries are up to standard and have free resources left, then we can speak of improving the situation for immigrants.
__label__Evidence	three-strike laws should be abolished as it negatively impact minorities and people of color who are more likely to commit crime due to poverty issues.

__label__Evidence	this form of trading removes the human element which can have dangerous consequences.

__label__Evidence	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Position	I also think detecting & moderating potentially hateful comments both through algorithms and manual reporting is the best way to go about it. Comments should be held back for review if there's any reports or detection of potential hate speech. When reporting, people should have the space to briefly explain their reason for reporting though because a lot of times, hate comments can be nuanced or reference things that will often go above the heads of those reviewing the reports if they only have a very basic list of types of report they can choose from.
__label__Evidence	scientology is an abusive, cult-like organization that exploits its members. we must ban it to protect people.
__label__Evidence	human cloning should be banned as the long term effects on the cloned is still uncertain and could lead to long term health complications
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__Evidence	using capital punishment on prisoners is either the same or worse than any crime that they committed to end up there in the first place.
__label__Position	This makes it hard fr the reader to connect to said topic as they cant express their views
__label__Evidence	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem

__label__Evidence	factory farming is necessary in our society as a way to control and protect the environment in which the animals are living so they are not subjected to disease and predators.
__label__Evidence	Personally I like to read other peoples' comments, it can offer an alternative view to the first comment being made and it opens your mind to accepting other views.
__label__Evidence	This would completely eliminate everyone elses' chance for discussion
__label__Evidence	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.

__label__Evidence	factory farming produces more quantity resulting in lower prices and more choices.
__label__Evidence	subsidised student loans would encourage everyone to go to university if they thought they wouldn't have any debt at the end of the studies.
__label__Evidence	I think it would just become full of comments from people who were writing things just to get a reaction - feeding the trolls!
__label__Evidence	we should not ban factory farming as it is the most efficient method of farming to produce enough food for the population.
__label__Position	We should stop subsidizing mass livestock farms
__label__Position	Hate speech leads to violence and I really think it should be eradicated https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Position	should be open to all
__label__Position	There should be fines introduced for hateful speech.
__label__Evidence	subsidized student loans allow for those from pooer backgrounds to achieve a good standard of education and progress in their lives
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Evidence	All countries should share the responsibility for refugees. Resettlement of the refugees should be done without much delay. They should be provided with skill development courses and employment opportunities to help them in living a dignified life.
__label__Evidence	targeted killing should be banned because no one should be specificaly tracked down and killed when they don't know it.
__label__Evidence	It will create faster moderation of content
__label__Evidence	The administration of justice is a member state competence. Shadowy attempts by federalist institutions to enhance their influence at the expense of the sovereign member states are contrary to the letter of the EU Treaties, counter-productive, and have contributed greatly to the crisis of the EU by alienating national institutions. This is especially the case for courts. Several member states' high courts have declared the ECJ ultra vires (acting beyond its powers). This lawlessness on the part of federalist institutions must stop with immediate effect, and we must reaffirm the principles of subsidiarity and conferral.

__label__Evidence	space exploration is invaluable because it may help us to find solutions for global warming or even planets that can sustain human life.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Evidence	these days, child actors are provided with tutors while on set to ensure their education is minimally disrupted and there is more support than there used to be
__label__Position	We should not hide opinions but a general respect should be lined out in rules of comments, where no hate speech or prejudice should be allowed. People should still be given a voice to speak on topics with respect to every other human being and this should be monitored by the platform from preventing any prejudice that could be commented. I ultimately think there should still be a comment section for all people, but within a controlled environment on the platform.
__label__Evidence	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.

__label__Position	We should increase the salaries of artisans
__label__Evidence	I am deeply uncomfortable with the idea of 'tracking people down' for 're-education' for the sin of offering their opinions online (even if said opinions are quite obnoxious).
__label__Position	i think writers should also be careful of how they write their articles because sometimes their angles are the ones encouraging hate speech
__label__Evidence	collectivism helps encourage those who are minorities and may not be able to have luxuries others may have.
__label__Evidence	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Position	Newspapers will be commented on in other spheres anyway. by separating this from the newspaper site itself this allows for almost anything to be said on the matter (depending on the controls in those spheres). The advantage to allowing a comments section on the site itself but also moderated and with a reporting system in place, allows for any misdirects or fake news that may pop up in the comments to be directly addressed along side the article and will allow peoples views and voices to be heard
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Evidence	What are you 5? And what do you mean by first-world? Should we create a task force just to understand what countries are to be considered the first world? Is it the money? The religion? The food? Their political system? And then reevaluate each year? This comment is plain ignorant.

__label__Evidence	only way to punish, to defend our society from threat countries is economic sanctions and that should be followed all the time.
__label__Evidence	it can be very beneficial for people with certain illnesses so should be legal
__label__Position	I do not believe it is necessary to name and shame users of hate speech, as although their actions are wrong, this may lead to humiliation and darker thoughts, self harm or suicide. Repying to the comment with empathy and education may be the best guide, and if the action does not change, possibly a block.
__label__Evidence	children are far too easy to exploit and they sometimes end up being far too precocious at an early age due to fame and all it brings.

__label__Position	I agree it is going to need a world effort to combat climate change. Not just a few rich countries trying to.
__label__Evidence	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.

__label__Evidence	there is no fast food that is healthy so banning it would improve public health immeasureably.
__label__Position	We should make the bicycle and walking the first transport mode in our cities
__label__Position	It goes further than this. We live in a society that has a lot of cry babies. We need to be impervious to negative comments from strangers on a social platform and that is anonymous. Most people need to grow a pair, develop a spine or stop being cry babies. Once this is achieved you will see that any contribution you make to a discussion will be debated in a civilized manner.
__label__Evidence	an approval of selective killings can trigger a war between the community, that's why i do not support selective assassinations
__label__Evidence	I actually agree that eliminating the space for conversation on polarizing topics can reduce extremist echo chambers sometimes. Though they often move to other platforms that have zero regulations to hold that conversation when they can't have it where they saw something. Which increases the odds of being stuck in a hateful echo chamber.
__label__Evidence	gender neutral language is just another way to try to please a group. we have two sexes, men and women and they should be differentiate by the use of words.
__label__Evidence	economic sanctions are very effective in dealing with countries who have many human rights abuses on their record.
__label__Position	While I fully appreciate the urgency of curtailing hate speech, I am strongly of the view that the space comment should not be eliminated because of a few bad apples. Rather an algorithm that can monitor and flag down hateful comments in real time could be used and thus positive and constructive contributions would continue to trickle in. Besides, merely shutting down the space comment results in cancel culture which is a step back in our dispensation.

__label__Position	It is a tricky one to get the balance correct. There will always be some people in society who are happy to spout nonsense/hatred online as they sit behind a keyboard. At the same time, there will also be people who wish to share their more sensible and respectful views on topics.

__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Evidence	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Evidence	Trump has been prioritizing some noticeable issues like the Muslim immigration clampdown, challenging the independence of the Fed, bizarre and ill-qualified cabinet selections, antagonizing China and other trading partners for no reason or embracing Russia and its rogue regime. This is not acceptable beyond limits and can turn people and communities against him.

__label__Evidence	economic sanctions can help control financial situations

__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__Evidence	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Evidence	banning cosmetic surgery would take the pressure off people to look a certain way that media and society dictates.
__label__Evidence	I have no trouble with, non-western, immigrants. I have trouble with 'mass immigration'. What happens is when they come in large numbers they do not integrate anymore. They stick to themselves and become a new tribe that tries to change their host country.'

__label__Evidence	we can not allow the cloning of humans, it goes against the laws of god and the laws of nature
__label__Position	I agree with other posters that moderation is the answer. There should be dedicated resource within newspapers that look at comments being made, and removing those that breach guidelines. Guidelines should be publicly accessible. Comment should be closed after a pre-defined period of time to reduce burden on moderators.
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__Evidence	guns are much too dangerous and often get in the wrong hands
__label__Evidence	Alcohol addiction is not just a threat to the person that drinks, but also to his/her entire family.
__label__Position	Comments, especially on a heated/controversial topic, can quickly disintegrate into banter and spiral into hateful and hurtful comments. Therefore, it is important to reduce this occurrence with moderators that warn and remove those that cross the line. However, moderators can be biased as well. It is therefore important to first allow multiple moderators from different sides and create a definition of what is considered hate speech so that removal can be justified.
__label__Evidence	Educating people (such as making it mandatory in the school system) on how to reverse climate change can give people the option to make positive changes to the situation.
__label__Evidence	IT is absoluety the websites job to police polirising comments if nesccearry to keep peace wihthin the outiside community viewing their newspapers.
__label__Evidence	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Evidence	We do need migrants, from an ethical and practical point of view. Europe is old and archaic in most of its practices. Innovation is failing and the best we can do is defend the status quo and the old people in power.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	only constructive criticism should be allowed

__label__Evidence	Giving immigrants more rights will lead to the forced displacement and eventual erasure of indigenous Europeans. This is criminal. If what's happening to the Uyghurs and Tibetans in China is genocide then so is this. This idea proposal is not grassroots, it's astroturfed lies to hide the fact that our migration policies are totally undemocratic and forced onto native Europeans.

__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Evidence	We should not subsidize space exploration as there are far more important and urgent issues to deal with on earth at this time.
__label__Evidence	We need to ensure fair redistribution of refugees across Europe and ensure better integration of refugees and applicants for international protection into the workplace.

__label__Evidence	space exploration is a bottomless money pit that completely fails to justify the enornomous quantity of revenue pumped into it.
__label__Position	The comment section needs to be moderated using some kind of filter to automatically filter any words on the banned list and then use a report system to flag up anything which tries to bypass this. This will allow a human moderator to quickly decide what can be kept and what needs action.
__label__Evidence	subsidizing embryonic stem cell research can lead to forced gathering of the stem cells and may even cause worse reactions.

__label__Position	There can be a filtering system that filters hate speech
__label__Position	ban people who post hate speech
__label__Position	Based on the analytics, most people disagree with suggestions put forward so it is difficult to decide on a way to reduce hate speech whilst comment sections still exist. Most people agree that moderation is a good approach, it's just difficult to know if all people doing this will be fair. It might be better to do it with AI so it's non biased.
__label__Evidence	Many people that are forced into retirement often do not have the means of supporting themselves financially, and so either turn to part time, low-wage work or welfare to sustain themselves.
__label__Evidence	Safe spaces allow individuals to embrace their identity without fear of ridicule.
__label__Position	We are on a slippery slope. Soon we won't have any privacy online whatsoever. We won't be able to express ourselves properly and won't be able to be anonymous. Is it really worth losing our privacy and our right to free speech just to avoid potentially offending some people? This issue has been being studied and written about for years now. Take a look at this Pew Research Center article from 2017: https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/03/29/the-future-of-free-speech-trolls-anonymity-and-fake-news-online/

__label__Evidence	c onsidering that information, and the hate speech which is still on Facebook - is AI able to work effectively?
__label__Evidence	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Position	We should protect the EU borders and stop migration
__label__Evidence	there are other stem cells that aren't from embryos that could be used instead.
__label__Position	We should choose or create a new European (or global) auxiliary language
__label__Evidence	A humanitarian association that helps a migrant to enter the EU illegally should also be dragged in front of the court for not taking the illegals to the closest safe port. In 90% of the cases, the closest port lies in Africa.
__label__Evidence	we should ban them because it is a cult that expects members to pay lots of money to join, and if anyone tries to leave they make their life hell.
__label__Evidence	It has to work like with air travel: Book a coherent journey from A to B operated by different companies, and be sure that if something goes wrong, there will be a solution (rebooking, ...).
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Evidence	children will make mistakes, because they are not mature. we have to allow some discretion in the hands of the administrators
__label__Evidence	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Position	I think it would be helpful if we could create a trusted shared resource for quickly checking accuracy of information. Something like Snopes https://www.snopes.com/ for example that helps you quickly sort out whether the information is balanced. It doesn't fix the issue because there's always contention about "reliable sources" but it can help reduce some of that, perhaps news agencies can link them in the top of the comments section or include it as a quick link button when commenting so you can easily fact that comment itself without copy pasting.

__label__Evidence	many citizens are morally opposed to using embryonic stem cells and using their tax dollars to fund it would be immoral.
__label__Evidence	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Evidence	The EU needs to both promote and uphold the highest social and environmental standards in its internal as well as external policies. Human rights and collective agreements must never be seen as barriers to trade!
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Evidence	Banning hate speech cannot be a form of censorship if the views your express incite hate or violoence against other groups.
__label__Evidence	if the technology exists them it should be up to individuals to decide what sex child they have as this will effect them more than anyone else.
__label__Evidence	This will go against the purpose of public opinion. Public opinion is informative and sometimes educational
__label__Evidence	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Evidence	no hate speech!
__label__Evidence	I don't think removing the comment spaceis a good idea, people should still be given a platform where they can voice themselves out. Having a team look through the comments and find those that include hate speach and remove them and maybe ban the people whith hatespeach comments from ever posting comments again.
__label__Evidence	no autonomous car will every be able to make complex judgement calls the way a human can.
__label__Evidence	This will enable people to discuss freely

__label__Evidence	safe spaces are necessary so that traditionally marginalised groups can interact freely without fear of harm and oppression.
__label__Evidence	school uniforms make is so that everyone is equal
__label__Position	I firmly think that removing the comment section is inappropriate as people have a freedom of speech however, certain systematic updates should be installed that filter out or flag the hate comments. If the comment is found to be hate speech it will notify the sender and not publish the comment to keep the flow of the conversation.
__label__Position	attaching more serious sanctions for people who use harmful/hateful speech.
__label__Evidence	there are too many incidents of people getting shot either by accident or because people shoot first and ask questions later or even people suddenly becoming unhinged and going on shooting sprees.
__label__Position	This statement was inspired and taken from Secretary General (https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/hate-speech-is-not-free-speech-says-secretary-general-ahead-of-human-rights-day) I am a firm believer that we are all entitled to freedom of speech. I am also a believer that nobody should feel threatened after sharing a written piece in a newspaper. The easy access to comment sections is drawing out the wrong type of people who post extreme forms of hate. I do not believe that this is the correct exercise of free speech. There are many ways we can share opinions, but attacking people online is not the way. Hate comments should be banned
__label__Evidence	algorihmitic trading is much less expensive for the individual trader.
__label__Evidence	economic sanctions should remain as it gives us a leverage against countries who don't obey the rules like iran and north korea.
__label__Evidence	I believe the comment space is a place where people get really involved and there is a chance for healthy discussion. However, this is not always the case. Some troublemakers tend to post derogatory statements and use cuss words which is not acceptable. This is a drawback when using the comment section.
__label__Evidence	I agree, i think several moderators should be put in place to review the comments.
__label__Evidence	a multi party system is too volatile, there's no stability and no consistency
__label__Evidence	The comment space allows positive ideas to filter through
__label__Evidence	Capital punishment creates space for potential rehabilitation without prison over-population.
__label__Evidence	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Evidence	Today no problem has a single solution and no new technology is related to a single discipline. We need multiple inputs from multiple disciplines and our institutes have failed in doing so.
__label__Evidence	People will say whatever they want even mean things and say it is free speech.People should learn to be kind to others without using free speech as an excuse
__label__Evidence	obesity is rising at an alarming rate and fatty foods and sugar filled drinks are shown to be one of the biggest contributors so fast food should be banned because those foods are sold there.
__label__Evidence	the school is designed to educate not to accept student abuse
__label__Evidence	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	i maintain my position in saying that algorithms can be used to identify hate speech. It's important to adhere to the rights of the readers and give them a way to express their opinions,otherwise how else could the newspaper get feedback?
__label__Evidence	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Evidence	legalizing prostitution sends the message that prostitution is okay, but it is not. prostitution is just the tip of the iceberg of human trafficking and abuse. it should not be condoned.
__label__Evidence	a multi-party system is the fairest representation of all political viewpoints, and would increase the electorate's engagement with politics in general.
__label__Evidence	I agree
__label__Evidence	whaling has devastating effects on the entire ocean ecosystem.
__label__Evidence	We should not ban targeted killing as it is the only way to deal with particular criminals who are otherwise not able to be captured or killed.
__label__Evidence	we should abolish the three-strikes law because the definition of a previous violent offense could be arbitrary and prisons need to be places for rehabilitation, not excessive punishment.
__label__Evidence	economic sanctions keep people from doing bad by costing them precious money
__label__Evidence	zoos can help people, especially those with little money, to discover the beauty of wildlife and learn how to protect endangered species
__label__Evidence	Give those who want to come a fair & secure possibility to do so & send those back who really damage your society. Give training, support, opportunities. My guess is that most will pay back with their contributions.
__label__Evidence	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Position	Words and phrases that could be offensive should be banned from use in the comment section. Comments left on a post could be verified to be safe by a moderator before they are publicly visible to others.
__label__Evidence	there are questions of it's legitimacy and whether it is a cult as well as the fact that members have to pay more to move up the levels thereby leading some to come into financial troubles due to this

__label__Evidence	Stops online bullying
__label__Evidence	I agree
__label__Evidence	I don't really agree with that. Europe is not China and is not the USA. We don't need a strong army because Europeans don't plan to make war, our strength is to find common ground and bring peace to the world with diplomacy and intelligence.
__label__Evidence	Technical issues in banking can halt access to our money. This can interfere with our daily lives.

__label__Evidence	we should abolish the olympic games because there have too many scandals involving cheating and doping on illegal steroids and substances.
__label__Evidence	Good way to educate society.
__label__Position	Commenters should agree to abide by all rules when signing up to the website and he banned for breaking the rules. Also all submitted comments must be thoroughly checked for negative for flagged words or topics. Also I think it would reduce the chances of this happening if users could not reply to each other or comment on others opinions. It's about each users initial opinion on a certain subject and less about judging others opinions on what they think!!!!
__label__Evidence	a multi-party system would bring more choices for people to speak up and vote.
__label__Evidence	Hoping that they may publish is wishful thinking as well unless they have a system for it.
__label__Evidence	I agree with you. I am a member of some public facebook groups for various things and they all have volunteer moderators who immediately remove harmful content. This is definitely feasible, especially if they are paid positions.
__label__Evidence	we should not adopt atheism because it is not a religion
__label__Evidence	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Evidence	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Evidence	modern days require modern measures and judicial activism brings present day thinking and opinions into important cases to stay up to date
__label__Evidence	i am against this because an austerity regime increase tax which decreases the economy and would ruin our country financially.
__label__Evidence	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Evidence	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Evidence	I overall agree with this- communication is the key.
__label__Evidence	they can lead to too much indecision
__label__Evidence	collectivism does not allow for individual enterprise and it stifles entrepreneurism.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Evidence	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Position	screen it before it gets posted, hire more people, they need more jobs available anyway
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.

__label__Evidence	https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-and-real-harm
__label__Evidence	We should not abolish capital punishment because if the criminal done with their time in jail they may commit far more serious crime again because some criminal cannot be rehabilitated
__label__Evidence	space exploration may be of tremendous benefit to mankind but isn't practical for private enterprise to fund because of the enormous costs involved
__label__Evidence	I agree to remove it and that opinions should be on the third party sites.
__label__Evidence	"Measures proposed that are inappropriate to building pathology" (Crispin Edwards)
__label__Evidence	we should not subsidize wikipedia because peoples opinions will get in the way of truth.
__label__Evidence	This article summarises it well https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation
__label__Position	I don't think this can be done, if there is space for comments there will always be people who want to abuse it
__label__Evidence	you can only give someone so many chances. if they have not learnt by the third time it is unlikely they will learn at all.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Position	Food whose production has been subsidized with EU funds should not be allowed to be exported to developing countries.
__label__Position	My position is that comments should be allowed and not taken too seriously, although if someone replies to a comments, it is probably to point out an error.
__label__Evidence	people are going to feel like their views are supressed
__label__Evidence	it will decrease the number of crimes and violence on the streets
__label__Evidence	Who deems whether criticism is valid or invalid in this situation? I guess there will always be conflicting opinions and ideas, but over policing of this may not be the solution to managing hate speech.
__label__Evidence	we should not adopt libertarianism because the government would have too much control over people
__label__Evidence	without knowing the long term effects of cloning, it shouldn't be attempted on humans because it could be medically problematic.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	This is a good solution which would reduce burden on moderators, whilst also automating some of the process.
__label__Evidence	we should legalize cannabis because it is harmless.
__label__Position	Opinions should be carefully vetted before being published to ensure that any offensive material is not published.
__label__Evidence	Indians as a whole consider educational institutions as job machines, we expect to enter unemployed and come out with employment. We don’t realize that we will have to upgrade our skills to become worthy of employment. This is the reason that more than 80% of engineers are unemployable and the figures are even worse for the non-engineers.
__label__Evidence	school uniforms help everyone feel more like each other and takes the focus off their clothes and allows for more focus on learning.
__label__Evidence	banning fast food won't change anyone's diet because unhealthy choices will still be there
__label__Evidence	sex selection is simply a matter of choice and bodily autonomy; every woman should be allowed to decide this on her own
__label__Evidence	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Evidence	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars leave both passengers and pedestrians vulnerable to malicious hacking which could cause wide scale destruction.
__label__Evidence	it is necessary to eliminate the church of scientology for the safety of people
__label__Evidence	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Evidence	human cloning can provide a lot of advancements to medical science. to ban it out of some knee-jerk fear is to deny ourselves all of these potential great advancements
__label__Evidence	There need to be some rules for integration:Integration does not mean completely open borders.
__label__Evidence	We have started losing our basic human habits and instincts, and are actually governed by devices and apps.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Position	Asking for their constructive criticism and how it will benefit the individual and community.
__label__Evidence	the security of child and teachers is esential for all
__label__Evidence	prisoners could be let go after serving their years as their perspective could change and they could play a part in helping the society through workforce
__label__Evidence	if we subsidize embryonic stem cell research, we can likely find cures for many conditions and diseases.
__label__Evidence	Then who is the judge and jury to decide what is right and what is wrong?
__label__Evidence	we should abolish safe spaces because it can become a toxic place where people only talk bad about each other
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Position	1. Integration of the comment section with a non-anonymous social media platform such as Facebook is necessary to reduce hate speech. 2. We need to address the issue of social media encouraging polarising views. Most social media of nowadays allows you create a bubble that shares a singular opinion without looking outside of the bubble. The lack of exposure would contribute to the hate speech. 3. The education system needs an almost complete overhaul. Education about things such as critical thinking, marginalised groups, bullying, creativity and imagination would reduce hate speech because they are well educated. 4. Consideration for every student is important. Things that could prevent a child from learning efficiently are important such as learning disabilities, poverty, etc. They should be addressed by using things like free lunches and creating accommodations. Paying students to go to university would encourage even greater critical thinking 5. The government should care more for its citizens. It is things such as poverty and illness inducing stress that could prevent people from thinking clearly before they speak. Prioritizing happiness and wellbeing would most definitely contribute to the lowering of hate speech by for example, highlighting the country’s nature, prioritising social welfare, and closing the gap between the rich and poor. In conclusion, the truth of the matter is that people have these horrible opinions because they are stressed about something and cannot think clearly. That and a lack of education. Focusing on these issues would result in a massive decrease of hate speech
__label__Evidence	cannabis has been proven to cause psychiatric problems in users thus it would be to our detriment to legalise it.
__label__Evidence	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Position	By educating people about the harm caused by hate speech that results in people committing suicide
__label__Evidence	There is a need for a balance between solidarity and responsibility. A reform of the Dublin system is needed, but the revision work has not moved an inch since 2019. There have been attempts of making progress in adopting a common European asylum system and forming an EU-wide resettlement system with sufficient financial incentives, while also stressing its aim to closely monitor migration routes and maintain situational awareness. This issue should be enhanced on a European level, as we never know when there will be a new crisis at our hands, this time caused by climate change and environmental disasters forcing people to go into diaspora and search for a safe haven.
__label__Position	I f we reduce usage of contaminating earth stuff eventually the earth will heal itself. The earth is a wonderous thing. Now the problem eventually will not be whether the earth can recover it will be if humans can survive in the toxic atmosphere created by humans. The earth will be here a long time its life that will become extinct. Focus more on not what will happen to the earth but what will happen to life on earth.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Evidence	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Evidence	telemarketing is nothing but a nuisance and are a vehicle for scams
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Evidence	if the right to keep and bear arms was abolished, it would decrease the number of weapons that are available and lessen violent crime.
__label__Evidence	without further research we won't know what amazing potential we have with embryonic stem cells
__label__Evidence	This makes so much sense, and its not like it cannot be done. Many countries during the lockdown for Covid, showed they could easily have one day a month or such to have no pollution days where it would help the environment immensely
__label__Evidence	the value of a group should not be deemed more important just because of the amount of people. it does not increase their value.
__label__Evidence	This should be part of every single citizen mendality in this planet. Assuming that this is a problem of someone else, then we will lose the fight before it even starts!
__label__Position	We should include limited profitability enterprises in the EU treaties
__label__Evidence	And not just the batteries. The EU should have an overall policy with a clear goal to restrict and reduce planned obsolescence.
__label__Evidence	a zero-tolerance policy in schools shouldn't be adopted because the smallest little unimportant things could lead to a student being suspended.
__label__Evidence	thepride parades are part of the empowerment of the lgbt community
__label__Evidence	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Evidence	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Evidence	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Evidence	I agree
__label__Evidence	Technology brings people together when they are distant, accelerates bureaucratic procedures, it allows us to work from home or from any country in the EU or outside. It allows for an immense flow of information to be easily accessible to us. As long as people do not want to do illegal online activities, it is each person’s individual decision what to do with their own online time or how much time they might want to be online.
__label__Evidence	True, I have read on one of the report on the COP205 that issues left unresolved included discussions on Article 6, common time frames, long-term finance, transparency issues for the Paris Agreement, report of the Adaptation Committee, and the report of the Consultative Group of Experts.
__label__Evidence	fast food can lead to obesity if eaten too often. banning it would mean people have less access and obesity levels would fall.
__label__Evidence	body parts are not something for profit. selling of a kidney should not go to the highest bidder. there is a system in medicine to make sure they are donated and to the ones most able to use them
__label__Evidence	too many hate words
__label__Evidence	The defense of the equality of value and dignity of each and every single human life is decisive for the future of Europe.
__label__Evidence	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Evidence	there are times when it makes sense for people to get another chance
__label__Evidence	This may work
__label__Position	We should make pushbacks legal
__label__Evidence	Why do we even let in migrants who do not speak the language of the country where they wish to reside? Migration is bad for the nations and degrading for the migrants. We must work to end mass migration.
__label__Evidence	organ trade must remain illegal. there is far too much potential for corruption and human trafficking/murder if organs can be sold.
__label__Evidence	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Position	I think that the website should develop a hate speech filtering software, to remove all offensive words that might be of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	Newspapers are a valid and beneficial space for comments
__label__Evidence	Using technology, people are maintaining and improving relationships with their friends, family, and relatives. Many people are also connecting with each other to help the needy and inspire each other. So, now we have better tools to build human connections.
__label__Evidence	This is one of the most sane posts in this discussion. Thank you.
__label__Evidence	the church of scientology should be banned, as it is a fraudulent religion that controls its members and was started purely as a social experiment by a con man
__label__Evidence	we need to have the safest possible learning environment, as this enables students to perform at their best.
__label__Evidence	why should we cater to the absolute minority and flip our whole language for trivial matters?
__label__Evidence	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Position	Again, a committee should be set to properly scrutinize the comments before they are uploaded.
__label__Evidence	some citizens simply don't have the time to vote, having more important things that can be way more crucial and holding that against them is authoritarian
__label__Evidence	this should not be banned as it makes trading easier and simpler.
__label__Evidence	subsidizing student loans lets the students work in their classes not at jobs to pay for their education
__label__Position	We should abolish the National Register of Citizens (NRC)
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	We can start by encouraging people to debate and say their opinions to incite meaningful and helpful conversations and comments instead of hate and other harmful communication types
__label__Evidence	Many child actors end up being exploited by the studios and even their own management and families.
__label__Evidence	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading is unfair to investors who are trying to invest hard earned money as a second income
__label__Evidence	executive compensation overlooks those that helped to increase the work vitality of an executive and do not receive compensation even if they have done all the work.
__label__Evidence	this breaks the separation between church and state and has got to stop.
__label__Evidence	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Evidence	gender-neutral language is simply a natural progression in a society based on sexual equality - there is no reason for textual dominance, and such neutrality serves to gradually temper preconceptions.
__label__Position	Removing hate speech comments is the solution to go to, if you attacked me then you didn't respect my freedom.
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Position	A combination of human moderation and automated actions should be applied. Free speech and the ability to comment is important to maintain the relationship between media and the reader (see Society of Editors Moderation Guide - https://www.societyofeditors.org/resources/). This needs to be balanced with contributing of human resources to combat hate speech using preventative and reactive measures,
__label__Evidence	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	wikipedia is a go to for many people and it should be kept well funded.
__label__Evidence	I agree

__label__Evidence	economic sanctions are not effective.
__label__Evidence	people need a place to go when they need help. they need somewhere that is going to help them without question instead of forcing them back into the situation they are trying to get away from
__label__Evidence	executive compensation is a way to reward and incentivize the top employees.
__label__Position	Use software to filter out offesive words.
__label__Evidence	Horrible idea. Next, you will limit water or air?! This is not the way to move on climate change. You can do much more via mass politics and not focus on individuals or limit their freedoms. If you want to stop eating meat, do so, I won't.
__label__Position	No, everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Evidence	some crimes are so heinous that the only just punishment is the death penalty.
__label__Evidence	Taking away comments will mean a one sided news media and that is dangerous.
__label__Evidence	we should not ban cosmetic surgery because it could help a disfigured person regain confidence.
__label__Evidence	people should be free to use a computer trading program at their own risk
__label__Evidence	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Evidence	three -strikes laws take discretion away from judges. a person committing a minor crime could be sentenced to life if he had a criminal history from long ago. these laws backlog our courts, cram our prisons.
__label__Evidence	I agree with this comment sections can provide excellent reccomendations, for example: https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/oct/20/steely-dans-20-greatest-songs-ranked
__label__Evidence	human cloning is just a step in the natural progression of science
__label__Evidence	Mass migration is an evil that hurts the nations as well as the migrants themselves, who suffer indignities and risk their lives. We must end mass migration. This requires that migrants be helped as close to the origin of migration as possible.
__label__Evidence	school uniforms keep school from becoming a fashion show.
__label__Position	Hate speech must be eliminated. The only way to do this thoroughly is with human moderation.
__label__Evidence	animals deserve to be in the wild, with access to large open spaces not available at a zoo.

__label__Position	The newspaper should vet newspaper reader and make sure their platform is not dominated by racist
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars will reduce the human margin of error to near zero and make for a safer commute.
__label__Evidence	Political parties are central to the functioning of Democracy. Political Parties go on to form the government. The government policies are then governed by the party’s ideology. Thereby, it becomes essential for political parties to come under the ambit of RTI.

__label__Evidence	school prayer should be prohibited because it promotes one religion over another or over no religion.
__label__Position	Have slurs programmed in as keywords so that comments which feature them are not published.
__label__Evidence	I agree this article https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/03/29/the-future-of-free-speech-trolls-anonymity-and-fake-news-online/ speaks about hthis also. Being anon givens comfortability and lets people hide behind a false identity, taking that away would likely reduce hate speech on popular newspaper outlets out of fear of being identified. However, those with these views would likely continue on more far-right news outlets
__label__Evidence	The European flag should be systematically displayed, in addition to the national flag, on any facade of an embassy or consulate of a European country. This would enhance the image of the European Union in addition to synergies like the pooling of support services. This approach could accompany the construction of common structures and policies in the field of foreign affairs.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars can make trips more relaxing and help the traveler arrive refreshed and happy. it can also eliminate road rage.
__label__Position	Removing the comment space from newspapers infringes on on freedom of speech, a sure way to combat this is by eliminating anonymity.
__label__Evidence	But have you considered which one has more serious effects and consequences? I think that should be guiding in the main argument on whether to allow commenting or allow hate speech
__label__Evidence	we should cancel pride parades because it is forcing views some people don't agree with in their face
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.

__label__Evidence	I believe thats an accurate solution

__label__Evidence	I think increasing taxes on tobacco could do a similar thing. But then we would also have to increase the contributions to health insurance for people who overeat sugar, use sunbeds, etc., to be fair.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__Evidence	I partially disagree - perhaps 'aggressive' is too harsh a word for what I am trying to convey but newspapers have to take action here, and in some cases it needs to be very severe action.

Neither the European nor the national and regional parliaments should be abolished because of the need for global governance for the planet.

__label__Position	Many children and teens don’t want to be a part of negative behavior like name-calling, criticizing, bullying, and cyberbullying.

__label__Evidence	I agree. Especially people who work in that area of expertise and can give valuable inputs

__label__Position	would not be right if we take away the comment section. We would be punishing people that didn't do anything or even are people trying to help others and this way would complete stop everyone from sharing ideas or even help others in need.
__label__Evidence	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	i agree with this completely
__label__Evidence	we would crumble without services provided to us via the government - roads, fire stations, and more.
__label__Evidence	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Evidence	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Evidence	Norway and Iceland can provide their external point of view toward EU policy at the conference. But why only Norway and Iceland? Why not Switzerland? Why not the recognized candidates? And maybe even UK! I'm sure there are many lessons to learn from their experience in the EU and from the Brexit
__label__Evidence	If we want to uphold to our standards and what the EU represents, we shall help those immigrants and give them the tools to help us make our homes better and multicultural so when the chance is presented they can then have a way to help their countries. Simply blocking them out of our region and neglecting them won't solve anything. We will only make unnecessary enemies.
__label__Evidence	According to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (the ICCPR), ‘[a]ll peoples have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right, they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development.

__label__Evidence	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Evidence	To build a common European understanding and to create a European identity, we need our own common language.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Evidence	Libertarianism provides little to no support for those at the bottom and would not attain equitable outcomes for society.
__label__Position	The main idea would be to create a community that self-regulates itself, in addition to investing in a good IA that identifies hateful comments and the extreme solution would be to only allow accounts registered for more than 1 month (example) to comment
__label__Evidence	People who are spreading hate speech usually won't care for being educated
__label__Evidence	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Evidence	Reduces the amount of troll comments
__label__Evidence	when we demand other countries do not have nuclear weapons it is illegitimate and hypocritical to continue having our own
__label__Evidence	scientology is an evil cult that is sustained by stealing from its acolytes large sums of money in exchange for nothing

__label__Evidence	people should be encouraged to individuals
__label__Evidence	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Evidence	we should adopt atheism because you can live your life freely without the worry of being judged by god
__label__Evidence	that isn't bad, but there are some who can run circles around others with their linguistic skills
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Evidence	this would be a great way to allow blind people to be independent
__label__Evidence	The natural resources on earth are dwindling, we have to subsidize space exploration in order to find an outlet for this horrifying situation.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	the writer will not feel disheartened
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Evidence	everyone should be able to bear arms in order to protect themselves, their homes and their families.
__label__Evidence	People born in Africa or poor countries look for a better place for their kids to grow up, where there is no war, and where there is food, good education, and health systems.
__label__Evidence	a multiparty system would be too decentralized
__label__Position	My position on the topic still remains to rather find ways to reduce or even eliminate only the hate speech, instead of no speech at all. I find it interesting to read other people's opinions on different types of topics and I usually learn a lot.
__label__Evidence	zoos are a way of protecting endangered species from extinction and allowing scientific research to combat diseases and reintroduce the animals back into the wild.
__label__Evidence	Algorithmic trading can be manipulated to artificially alter the price by a competitor, harming anyone who uses algorithmic trading.
__label__Position	I think an AI that could identify some keyword related with hate speech would be helpful to flag that comment and allow further review
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Evidence	The Olympic Games have become nothing more than political contests that spur controversy between countries.
__label__Evidence	We should not adopt zero tolerance policies because they have not improved school discipline in other districts, only introduced more punishments for students.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Evidence	it is not fair for opinion to overrule when there are so many different ones.
__label__Evidence	The EU should be a global actor. Merge all Foreign affairs departments from member states into a coordinated European network for international policy and intelligence.
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Position	If the information is accurate and the facts are accurate.
__label__Evidence	If asylum applications are filed from abroad the security risks for asylum seekers are greatly reduced.
__label__Position	Every young European should be asked to go live in another country for 1 year at least
__label__Evidence	people have the right to be free and cannabis is a safe drug to be used as recreational
__label__Position	The manner in which questions are asked on newspapers should be directed enlightening for a solution and positive response.
__label__Evidence	private military companies are only in the business for profit and not for the "best" for our country in it's interests and private military companies should be banned.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars are the future. much safer than driving home drunk.
__label__Evidence	we should adopt gender-neutral language because it will make communication easier between genders
__label__Evidence	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Evidence	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Evidence	Nothing illustrates to me more the fall of European ethics than pro-abortion arguments. Nobody can dispute that a baby in the womb is alive and human, and yet people call their killing a 'human right'. How could we fall so low?
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Evidence	The material used to build bombs, radioactive and otherwise, could be used for industrial purposes, creating jobs and generally strengthening the economy.
__label__Evidence	The content is then controlled by the moderators. How do we ensure that a comment they simply disagree with but still adds to the discussion is let through?
__label__Evidence	people need to learn how to survive in this world so no safe spaces would benefit this
__label__Evidence	People switch careers even after working in one field for several years because our interests do change. So, when someone can do this while having so many personal responsibilities, it is much easier for youngsters to learn a new skill.
__label__Position	I agree that you have to assess moderation carefully, as not to ruin democracy
__label__Position	If we identify the negative feedback loops and break them, then we have a chance of slowing or even reversing climate change
__label__Evidence	Agreed, it's totally problematic once you start to censor opinion over simply bad language and obvious hate speech.
__label__Evidence	it is important that we help the less fortunate.
__label__Position	Having a screaning for all comments before they go up on the platform to make sure that they are not posted on the site.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Evidence	Tasking whole units with not only moderation of hate speech but also tracking it and analysing it for trends is a huge additional workload for an already stretched sector. It sounds great, but likely unrealistic in terms of newspaper resources.
__label__Position	By blocking the accounts of people that use hateful speech and not allowing them to access all newspapers websites
__label__Evidence	many child actors go on to being adult actors without any problems. if anything, perhaps more screening of children before allowing them to go into the profession.
__label__Evidence	I agree with this sentiment it is surely a step in preventing the spread of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	there is so much more to explore and learn about space that subsidising space exploration would bring us closer to learning and understanding what is beyond our planet.
__label__Evidence	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Position	I can't see anyone else's comments to respond to them either.
__label__Evidence	we need to subsidize journalism so that it continues to draw in good people

__label__Evidence	some facial abnormalities or perceived abnormalities cause significant mental distress to young people, influencing their development, when cosmetic surgery could positively transform their lives.
__label__Position	There is a strong need for newspapers to come up with strategies to manage this, as hate speech has been linked to increases in violence towards minorities, as seen here: https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons
__label__Evidence	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Evidence	the things is they might create fake accounts or have bots commenting on their behalf.
__label__Evidence	No censoring of opinions
__label__Evidence	Animals should not have to suffer to save a few dollars. Businesses need to have better morals and treating animals with care should be a top priority regardless of the cost. It also hurts small farmers.

__label__Position	We should put a higher tax or a toll on imported meat from abroad.
__label__Evidence	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Evidence	we should definitely ban targeted killing because the loss of life should never be a planned event.
__label__Evidence	It's the same with citizens of the USA using Americans to describe themselves. Yes, technically it isn't correct, but who cares...
__label__Evidence	I guess this works. However, people tend to find other ways to spread hate
__label__Evidence	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Position	Removal of comments entirely is akin to removal of freedom of speech and should be avoided.
__label__Evidence	compulsory voting would ensure that everyone would vote and have a voice in what goes on.
__label__Evidence	This may negatively impact the public. As newspapers may publish news in a manner deceiving the truth and those who are not aware would believe lies.
__label__Position	I think that, no matter the time cost, this is an essential step in the right direction. Technology is so advanced, I'm sure we can keep the readers comments sections while monitoring and dealing with hate speech.
__label__Position	Just allow people to report bad comments and when it gets to a certain number it should delete the message and send an automatic email to the person who wrote it with a warning.
__label__Evidence	Space exploration should be subsidized because the information learned from it could provide useful to our planet.
__label__Evidence	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy

__label__Evidence	we should subsidize journalism as it is a key element to investigating wrong doings in society

__label__Evidence	Zoos provide a platform for people to understand the natural and animal world.
__label__Position	Perhaps a team of moderators could be required, either with the power to approve posts that are waiting for approval, or by reactively monitoring.

__label__Position	We need a more thick skin with some of our debate topics if we want to win arguements against "hate"
__label__Position	The EU must ensure continued progress toward gender equality, women’s rights, and reproductive freedom
__label__Position	We should further develop robotization
__label__Evidence	By removing the comment section will entice further hate speech on another platform. Rather allow people to give their opinion and block comments that relate to hate speech.
__label__Evidence	we should abandon the school uniform because it is just another cost for parents to pay on top of all the other costs of a 'free' education.
__label__Evidence	economic sanctions are a way to implement sanctions on a country without the risks of military intervention.

__label__Evidence	It's a good idea to reduce anonymity so more people can be linked to the things they say and rightly may think twice about coming across as a hateful person.
__label__Evidence	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Position	We need an inclusive and pluralistic European society
__label__Evidence	Three strikes laws lead to prison over-population since more offenders are put away for a longer time. This leads to worse prison conditions and more violence in prisons.
__label__Position	We need an action programme to develop a more inclusive sector
__label__Evidence	globally, over 1 million people die a year in car crashes. to be able to have self driving safe cars that save that many lives a year would be outstanding. robots and self driving cars are the future.
__label__Evidence	I think you have hit the nail on the head here!
__label__Evidence	Cosmetic surgery is near permanent, minors cannot contextualize these changes due to their short life experience, and so are not mature enough to make sure life-changing decisions about their physical appearance.
__label__Evidence	if one matter is not given enough attention than that would have bad consequences as if might not reach a lot of people

__label__Evidence	Older workers provide maturity and experience and can be loyal and productive employees past the age of 65 or even 70
__label__Evidence	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Position	Despite my defence of human moderators, it seems they too are flawed -- check out this article https://www.technologynetworks.com/informatics/news/ai-trusted-as-much-as-humans-to-flag-hate-speech-365777 -- human moderators are not only prone to bias but also impractical. With the huge wealth of content posted every second online, it is unrealistic to expect humans to be able to view, criticise, and moderate every single comment.
__label__Evidence	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Evidence	Zoos work as educational centers and are not the cause of the extinction of animals, rather they help that this does not happen, that's why we should not abolish zoos
__label__Position	To this, even though I agree with the right to free speech, and feel that it should be monitored for hate speech.

__label__Evidence	nuclear weapons should be retained as they act as a deterrent and ensure world peace
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Evidence	This is interesting! I read an article about moderators with different policies on what constitutes hate speech and should be removed. There is an argument that some are too strict and moderate incivility, rather than just hate speech. Perhaps an AI version would have clearer guidelines programmed in? https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793

__label__Evidence	Any skill can be learned and mastered even if we do not have a degree in that. And programming is no exception.
__label__Evidence	ending these sanctions will boost the target country's economy
__label__Evidence	we should ban the use of child actors as they should be concentrating on getting an education first

__label__Evidence	private military companies are trained for combat and can assist the governmental military groups

__label__Position	websites should also take responsibility and liability for the comments on their sites
__label__Evidence	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Evidence	the government should not be interfering in other countries affairs.
__label__Evidence	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.

__label__Evidence	the use of economic sanctions are the best recourse we have to safeguard ourselves against problems
__label__Evidence	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Evidence	in moderation, fast food can be a treat or convenient meal for busy people. we should allow people to enjoy it.
__label__Evidence	Sustainable development and climate change mitigation in EU Trade deals should be examples of best practices of EU policy.
__label__Evidence	Unfortunately, we are way to late for this. The internet has been used for more than 20 years and it's getting worse. Hate speech does a lot of damages and we need to act quickly because it causes a lot of harm for several groups of people, ethnic groups, etc.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	In the Constitution, we have the right to keep and bear arms and we can't have that taken away,.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Position	I think most people are reasonable and will consider others' feelings and stand points before they post, at least to some extent. The people we need to worry about are those who just post their opinions without any thought or care for others who may be offended or even attacked by their post. These people are very hard to control as they want to be entitled to their 'freedom of speech', regardless of who it may offend or upset. On the other hand, restricting what people want to say is dodgy territory and we run the risk of entering into murky waters of what can be controlled by 'the powers that be'. If we let them control what we say, we're only half a step away from letting them control what we do...which arguably we already let them do in 2020 with the covid lockdowns etc. On reflection I therefore think that newspapers should have filters set up in their comments sections that automatically block hate speech (this can be pre-identified words and phrases). This way, people wanting to cause trouble by posting hate speech won't be able to do so on the newspapers' websites. I also agree with previous commenters who have suggested making the comments section a little harder to find, which will put off some of the troublemakers and also hide any sensitive comments from those not wishing to read any of the comments. I've been on a bit of a ramble here but I hope this all makes sense!

__label__Evidence	The key to successful immigration depends upon the possibility of employment. So EU members are to decide whom they want to admit.
__label__Position	I think that it is important for readers to be able to comment. I think it is unfortunately inevitable that some people will choose to leave hate speech, there is clearly no easy solution to this, but I do not think that eliminating the comments section is the answer, nor is allowing hate speech to flourish for it has real consquences. I think moderators are perhaps the only solution.

__label__Evidence	How would the candidates be selected? One per country? That just makes it a tight race between the two countries with the largest population (assuming one vote per person). Why would e.g. a Greek person vote for a Swedish candidate? How would even a Swedish candidate campaign in such a way as to appeal to Greek voters?

__label__Evidence	capital punishment takes too long and has a long appeal process costing taxpayers money.
__label__Evidence	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it.

__label__Evidence	I disagree. This limits the freedom of speech of people and for people to be able to give their opinion and potentially challenge the thoughts of the newspaper. I agree that this should be done in a respectful way.

__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	I think without the comments you will not be able to react to what you have read and have your say

__label__Evidence	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it.

__label__Evidence	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Evidence	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also

__label__Evidence	gender-neutral language will cause confusion if we don't know who is being referred to
__label__Evidence	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Evidence	Subsidizing journalism will allow individual journals to lift their paywalls, which will increase access.

__label__Evidence	Eliminating space for readers in its entirety removes any possibility of stimulating discussion. While hate speech is a serious consideration, I would hope that it forms a small minority of the comments posted on newspaper websites (but I guess this also depends on the topic since some are more charged than others). Surely some form of regulation would suffice to address the severity of hate speech.
__label__Position	Having read through the opinions of others, my stance has not completely changed. It is important to censor comments, freedom of speech does not always equate to disrespecting the views and opinions of others. While I agree that comments should be censored, I do not agree that every comment should be removed. As mentioned before, a system can be implemented that removes comments with certain words, thus making the comment section a safe space for all who use it.
__label__Evidence	This is the main problem that we are facing in the climate issue because some peoples are not considering the climate change problem. So the environment awareness is less. We need to consider the climate change.

__label__Evidence	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.

__label__Evidence	We should abolish the three-strikes laws because a crime is a crime and the criminal need to be punished for what type of crime they are committing and not base on how many times they committed the crime
__label__Evidence	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment

Not much of a future for the young Europeans.
__label__Evidence	5G in banking will bring much-needed financial inclusion to India’s rural and remote populations, for whom access to a physical bank is not possible.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__Evidence	it should be banned because it forces people to believe in the church
__label__Evidence	Someone's belief that a marginalised group doesn't deserve rights is far different from having a different opinion on something like the ending of a loved TV show.

__label__Evidence	students need help with the burden of college costs and shouldn't have to go into crippling debt to get an education.

Crony capitalism will be hugely curbed if political parties are brought under RTI Act.

__label__Evidence	a multi-party system allows for a broad range of ideas to be heard and implemented.
__label__Position	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks.

__label__Evidence	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars lack moral judgement.

This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Evidence	English is ideal as it is spoken internationally as the language of commerce, travel, and political exchange. Esperanto isn't.
__label__Position	Companies should pay for the environmental damage cause by their products
__label__Evidence	if people need somewhere safe they should be able to have it
__label__Position	We should give nuclear energy a green label
__label__Position	We can only achieve by tremendous advances and investment in technology: clean energy production, CO2 capture in massive scale, hydrogen planes, ... , and much much more
__label__Evidence	we should ban targeted killings because it is in essence just murder when done outside of wartime. it is, in fact, an act of war and could create more problems.
__label__Position	Hindi should be the national language of India
__label__Evidence	an auserity program will reduce the national debt.
__label__Evidence	cosmetic surgery for minors does not address self-esteem issues and the results of cosmetic surgery are irreversible.
__label__Evidence	we should abolish zoos because it's cruel to keep wild animals in small enclosures and spaces just for our amusement.
__label__Evidence	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Position	More control by moderators plus a code of conduct for users
__label__Evidence	capital punishment is seen as a cruel and inhumane way of treating prisoners.
__label__Evidence	they may sell weapons to countries that would use them inappropriately
__label__Evidence	we should ban human cloning because people were not made to be cloned, we are all unique and individual for a reason.
__label__Position	Bullet for Bullet is a right policy
__label__Evidence	Consensual sex can also be termed as rape if the wife is willing to file a false case. There will be no proof to prove whether it is consensual or not. Punishing men based on the mere words of wives is completely wrong, because of the presumption that women do not lie. Good and bad are not related to gender. There are women criminals too.
__label__Evidence	bullies should not be given second chances. being victim to school bullying is a major risk factor for developing mental health problems like depression, anxiety, and even suicidal thoughts.
__label__Evidence	we should adopt gender-neutral language because it avoids offending people with gender stereo-types
__label__Evidence	we should not legalize sex selection because the sex we were assigned at birth is all that matters.
__label__Position	I still maintain, comment sections should stay. Hate speech CAN and should be filtered. Read up more on this topic: https://www.techdirt.com/2021/11/08/killing-website-comment-sections-wasnt-brilliant-move-many-newsroom-leaders-assumed/
__label__Evidence	we should prohibit school prayer, the us courts have consistently ruled that it is unconstitutional
__label__Evidence	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Evidence	We are all for equal rights and opportunities for women, however, modern feminism has gone so far beyond the pale that it can no longer be supported. The BBC has recently found out that 'Some lesbians are increasingly being pressured and coerced into accepting trans women as sexual partners' - in effect fourth-wave feminism has reached the point where males are once again telling females who to have sex with. This must stop.
__label__Evidence	safe spaces foster isolation and retreat from the rest of society and they do nothing to address underlying safety issues.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Evidence	We should not cancel pride parades as they provide a great focal point to celebrate and help others to understand the diversity of society.
__label__Evidence	If such a thing can be created then it could work well
__label__Evidence	H ow are you tackling the trinity college Dublin project - what measures have you employed for this building? (Rachel Harris)
__label__Evidence	the uniforms limit the freedom of expression of the youngest and could be counterproductive in their stage of development
__label__Evidence	no single person should be compeled to give up their jobs due to certain things hence mandatory retirement is wrong.
__label__Evidence	I agree
__label__Evidence	nuclear weapons should be abolished because it is an ongoing health risk
__label__Position	There is no one answer. it must be a multitude of approaches. It is every organisations responsibility to regulate its platforms.
__label__Position	Arguments against: not legally liable https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/02/news-sites-not-liable-for-insulting-and-rude-reader-comments-says-echr
__label__Evidence	As a moderator in other capacities, I can tell you it takes a lot of time to manually review every single comment as they come in.
__label__Evidence	sex selection should be legal for parents to select the sex of the child. parents with all boys or all girls should have the choice of selecting the other sex.
__label__Evidence	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Evidence	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Evidence	Why everything is seen in a sexual nature? Brahmacharya doesn't mean women cannot worship god. Brahmacharya means observing celibacy. It doesn't mean that there shouldn't be female devotees of reproductive age. Narrow-minded people do not understand the difference between devotion and sexual attraction.
__label__Evidence	a person's value should not be based on a number. just because you reach a certain age does not mean you do not want or need to work. mandatory retirement hurts elderly workers.
__label__Evidence	this literally achieves nothing
__label__Evidence	Gendered language has served us for centuries in literature and culture, there is no need to change now.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Evidence	legalizing prostitution would only help the pimps. it would also increase demands and possibly human trafficking.
__label__Position	Europe should change the world for the better for everyone.
__label__Evidence	it causes people to receive disproportionately high sentences for petty crimes
__label__Evidence	If you disagree with how they run their websites, run your own website.
__label__Evidence	it is against certain religious beliefs and can be seen as immoral
__label__Evidence	True, but people take freedom of speech and it gives them the right to say whatever they want, without fear of persecution
__label__Evidence	school uniforms level the playing field for students in terms of appearance which can help with bullying of children from lower income families.
__label__Evidence	collectivism can achieve more than other forms of societal structure
__label__Evidence	Human cloning goes against nature and should be banned.
__label__Evidence	some people are evil and do no deserve to live
__label__Position	There should be better EU relations with Russia
__label__Evidence	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Evidence	Hate speech must be controlled in some how.
__label__Evidence	It is unjust to force government employees to kill a person the way capital punishment does.
__label__Evidence	People should be allowed to give their opinions because where else will be able to read how people feel about certain things happening around other than comments. I just think they should be monitored and taught to not post hateful comments.
__label__Position	We should create millions of jobs in the restoration of ecosystems, biodiversity, and climate change projects
__label__Evidence	I disagree with this. I think taking away discussion completely also takes away healthy debate and positive conversation. There are ways to reduce hate comments, such as the ones outlined in this Forbes article: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnrampton/2015/04/09/10-tips-to-dealing-with-trolls/?sh=58ddf0f754f4.
__label__Evidence	There will be no sense of security. We cannot sleep peacefully because the cryptocurrency’s value keeps on fluctuating. Standard currencies fluctuate too, but not as high as cryptocurrencies. If the value of standard currency falls, we can still afford to live in our country, because the fall of currency value impacts all fields. For example, if the prices of groceries rise, so do our salaries. But if the value of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin falls, we will lose our hard-earned money.
__label__Evidence	Young people are too often working under precarious conditions. Think of short-term, zero-hour contracts and unpaid internships. Many of them can only get a job if they are registered as self-employed, carrying all the responsibilities themselves and still being underpaid. Everyone should be able to get a decent job and access social protection. Trade unions play a crucial role in addressing these issues and defending this vulnerable group, which is why it is important that young workers join a trade union.
__label__Evidence	whaling is a major life blood for some communities.
__label__Evidence	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Evidence	embryonic stem cell research is against god's will and should be stopped.
__label__Position	"It is important to attract young people to study the built environment, sustainability, civil engineering, just as they currently focus on building new information systems. If we don't make these topics attractive to young students, the skills gap will only increase" (Paul Norman, Clarion Housing Group)
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars are our future and provide many benefits
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Evidence	we should ban fast food as its unhealthy and can cause sedentary lifestyles and cardiovascular disease
__label__Evidence	whales need to be protected before they are endangered.
__label__Evidence	wikipedia would be more accurate if it was subsidized.
__label__Position	Closing comments is not a solution in my opinion. I think the comments are quite interesting and I'm sure there are many people who like to read comments like me. The best solution is to have people's names and surnames appear and have a control mechanism for comments.
__label__Evidence	wikipedia is a valuable common resource that need more money to work better
__label__Evidence	there is a possibility that the servers could be hacked and alter algorithmic programming, which would cause widespread panic
__label__Position	I agree that people should be allowed to comment (otherwise they'd just go and rant on social media), but there should be ways to flag, review and approve or delete hateful and disrespectful content.
__label__Evidence	From the Association Christian in Democracy (Spain), we are clear that life is the greatest good of a society and as such must be protected from its conception to its natural end. For this reason, it should be part of the European Union's charter of fundamental rights and be protected from attacks against defenseless human beings, such as in the cases of abortion and euthanasia.
__label__Evidence	pride parades encourage people to claim the rights and freedoms they are entitled to
__label__Evidence	We cannot adopt but we should adopt to it because there is no other go with the affected environment unless helping the environment less pollution
__label__Position	Biogas plants should be assessed on the basis of their efficiency
__label__Evidence	Additionally when fear is reinforced by facts like increased violence in every country with a high number of immigrants, and rapes of women it is not a problem of 'perception' but a simple reality.
__label__Evidence	this practice insures students are all equal in dress and ensures students will not come to school in inappropriate clothing.
__label__Evidence	the olympic games encourage animosity between countries
__label__Evidence	The problem with allowing commentary to flourish without restrictions is that it can undermine the credibility of legitimate news sources. Frank Waddell, associate journalism professor at the University of Florida, noted that “If you see a bunch of individuals online who are leaving negative comments on a news article, you might think most people are evaluating this news as low quality,” Waddell said. “When asked to evaluate the news yourself, you might also think the news is more negative relative to someone who reads that same article without comments.” https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/
__label__Position	Technology is rising Unemployment rates
__label__Evidence	It's pointless trying to stop people having opinions on the news. If no space to comment is provided people will simply go to other forums to express their views. These communities could be more insular and less moderated, leading to polarisation of views and ultimately breeding extremism.
__label__Evidence	executives that award their own salaries have shown they can not show restraint
__label__Evidence	fast food contains ridiculous amounts of harmful ingredients
__label__Evidence	some laws may not be the best, and opinions are needed.
__label__Evidence	human cloning helps to eradicate diseases and should not be banned
__label__Evidence	many peoples make there livelihoods on whaling
__label__Evidence	Africa is the only continent where the number of young people continues to increase.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Evidence	in today society, which is multicultural and multi-faith, the school prayer is enforcing one ideology onto thos who may hold other backgrounds and religiions
__label__Evidence	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Position	My position as a reader and my argument is that bases on the rules of speech people have freedom of speech and expression. That should be done in a proper way without insulting others or hating or being racist in your speech. Websites and newspapers should not remove the comments of the people responding to hate speech. This is done according to the rules found in the following article: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230
__label__Position	I am sorry but NO. Almost the whole human civilisation runs of fossil fuels pumped from the deep carbon cycle to the fast carbon cycle. It will reverse naturally over several million years, not the short-term which we can benefit from right now.
__label__Evidence	avoiding the issues does not eliminate it
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Evidence	adopting libertarianism would eliminate many social programs, reducing access t food and health care to those in need
__label__Position	There should be a new EU foreign policy.
__label__Evidence	i agree with having to sign in to be able to comment.
__label__Evidence	this is absolutely something we should ban because children shouldn't be encouraged to be dissatisfied with their bodies
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Evidence	factory farming treats animals horribly, force feeds antibiotics and is a major source of pollution.
__label__Evidence	cannabis is a illegal drug for a reason, it is harmful dangerous drug that alters your mental capacity and should remain illegal.
__label__Evidence	factory farming is a cruel, inhumane practice that is tainting our food sources.
__label__Evidence	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Evidence	if we end economic sanctions, then it would lead to a more fair trade market.
__label__Evidence	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Position	In Gentzkow and Shapiro's (2011) study, 55% of the web traffic of the progressive New York Times was from political conservatives. This suggests that the people who are most likely to comment hold strong views, which they may express strongly.
__label__Position	Heritage buildings includes the 30% of existing dwellings that are of traditional construction (solid walled or narrow 'rat-trap' cavity). Improving energy efficiency is important, but can be substantially achieved without deep retrofit, through a mix of appropriate repair, improvements to heating systems, enhancement of existing windows, and some insulation, as well as some behaviour change. Inappropriate retrofit will have unintended consequences including poor occupant health, fabric damage, harm to heritage value AND net carbon emissions. Relaxing regulation or weighing carbon emissions more heavily against heritage value would therefore be highly counterproductive.
__label__Evidence	There's nothing wrong with not wanting your continent to become chaos and putting your people first, every civilization in this world takes that idea as self-evident. We need to negotiate Remigration deals with the 3rd countries to send their nationals back and we need to use Frontex to push back any migrants coming to our borders.
__label__Evidence	Entering the EU without a permit automatically excludes a person from any right to receive asylum.
__label__Evidence	A direct election of a European president is a travesty of democracy. It would be only a mediatic competition among 'plastic' leaders. Something very similar to The Simulacra (Dick's 1964 science fiction novel). We are not a 'nation', we are a confederation of nations.
__label__Evidence	The RTI Act states that wherever there is Public Interest, those organizations need to be transparent and come under the ambit of the law. There are numbers of Private organizations today, whether partially funded or fully; schools, hospitals, etc. that are under the RTI Act and not just Government organizations.
__label__Position	It is unnecessary to have censorship of comment sections. Let everyone see the bigots, the haters and yes, people with a different view of the world. It wont hurt to see that some people live totally different lives. That IS what reading is all about you know, living lives other than our own.
__label__Evidence	cosmetic surgery makes people feel self-conscious about themselves, providing false imagery of natural beauty
__label__Evidence	Ransomware hackers demanded their payment through bitcoins, because it protects identity of the person in financial transactions.
__label__Evidence	it makes it hard for young people to get a job because so many people still work when they could be retired and there would be more jobs available
__label__Evidence	we have too many problems here on our own planet to worry about putting money into searching space.
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Evidence	we should support collectivism, as everyone in the group benefits from this practice.
__label__Evidence	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Evidence	it is one of the worse cults and should be banned
__label__Evidence	banning all whaling is only justified by making cultural judgements.
__label__Evidence	"Indeed, adaptation and conversation sometimes in conflict" (Steven Bee)
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	churches in general are just cult and should be banned.
__label__Position	I love the suggestions about having real life moderators and user flagging comments for moderation. It's very effective on Meta.
__label__Evidence	free speech is maintained
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Evidence	without being able to completely erradicate drug taking the olympic games is not an accurate representation of the skill of the sportsmen, making it an outdated and irrelevant competition.
__label__Evidence	everyone has a right to make this choice
__label__Evidence	no more hate speech
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars eliminate the hazards of driving distracted and drunk driving. removing these hazards from our roadways will make us all safer.
__label__Evidence	there are two genders and it is not offensive to use those two descriptions when talking about people, it is ridiculous to attempt to include every possible gender identity.
__label__Evidence	the cost of an education is unaffordable for those who might most benefit from it
__label__Evidence	bannabis should be legalized as it has been proven to have medical benefits that outweigh any negative effects. it will also remove it from the control of criminals and gangsters
__label__Evidence	the right to keep and bear arms is putting everyone in danger and making mass-shootings more easily done.
__label__Evidence	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Evidence	there is no actual proof that god exists. it is all stories passed down no matter which religion. atheism would stop the fighting over which religion is superior.
__label__Evidence	Commercial banks help to create credit, which leads to increased production, employment, and consumer spending, all of which help to grow the economy.
__label__Evidence	missions can provide much needed infrastructure and healthcare projects.
__label__Evidence	we should not ban private military companies because they can provide great protection in many areas of our country
__label__Evidence	collectivism makes sure that all are taken care of and the weak will provided for.
__label__Evidence	Absolutely agree with this. Newspapers will moderate comments that do not agree with their agenda.
__label__Evidence	The Church of Scientology is a cult and should be banned.
__label__Position	We could put a system in place that would automaticly delete and report any comments that contain hate speach.
__label__Evidence	Cannot guarantee 100% data protection.
__label__Evidence	Student loan costs are becoming outrageous putting people in debt for life.
__label__Evidence	zoos torture animals by keeping them in unnatural cages.
__label__Evidence	Stops the bullying and people feeling bad
__label__Evidence	We should not abolish safe spaces because people who have PTSD will disengage from universities and other spaces if they cannot participate safely.
__label__Evidence	I feel newspapers don't work well and an interactive medium anyway. "letters to the editor" might be an avenue
__label__Position	There are many ways newspapers could use to eliminate hate speech from their comment sections. Methods such as software to identify keywords, moderators, having to register to comment, a report button, blocking users who post hate speech, and a clear set of rules displayed before posting. Using these systems should eliminate hate speech from comment sections while still allowing the public to have their say.
__label__Evidence	We should abolish the three-strikes laws because they discriminate against over-policed communities.
__label__Evidence	cannabis has medical benefits that could be used to give relief to people with chronic illnesses.
__label__Evidence	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Evidence	the judicial system requires independence, judicial activists undermine this independence and the practice should be limited.
__label__Evidence	the olympic games brings together the world in a peaceful environment
__label__Evidence	I agree that the hate speech perhaps should not be entirely removed. Sometimes a society has to confront its own ugliness/hatred head on, and removing it might do more harm than good (ie making commenters feel persecuted, perhaps making them even more hateful or violent). I also agree that still being able to access the newspaper might help change their minds.
__label__Evidence	higher education should be a right; subsidized student loans provides all who want to learn with access to an education
__label__Evidence	pride parades may help overcome prejudice and cultural barriers, they are what we need to start educating future generations.
__label__Evidence	human cloning in the wrong hands could be very dangerous to society
__label__Position	In the words of Peter Parker :"With great power, comes great responsibility." That said, it is absolutely the responsibility of a newspaer outlet to ensure that what they put on their platform is not harmful to those who come across it
__label__Position	It could be community moderated. Down vote and hide options if multiple people think it is not appropriate
__label__Evidence	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Evidence	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Evidence	mutually assured destruction is a crucial method of preventing actual conflict and disaster
__label__Evidence	ideas and products need to be available at a fair price for everyone, allowing companies to have their intellectual rights means they can charge far too much to people who need that service or product.
__label__Evidence	multi-party systems provide many new sources of views on relevant topics
__label__Evidence	Mandatory retirement ensures that companies and professions are constantly infusing their workforces with fresh talent.
__label__Evidence	zoos should be abolished because it is cruel and inhumane to cage animals.
__label__Evidence	capital punishment has been proven ineffective in reducing crime rates.
__label__Evidence	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	by adopting gender neutral language we can advance the cause of equality.
__label__Evidence	zoos are cruel to the animals taking them out of their natural environment
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Evidence	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Evidence	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Evidence	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Position	We should oppose collectivism
__label__Position	The newspapers should encourage the victims of hate speech to report hate speech published, establish monitoring and evaluation units in newsrooms. Some units should be tasked with monitoring hate speech trends, compiling reports and bringing these to the attention of key institutions
__label__Evidence	journalism should not be influenced by the government.
__label__Position	I'm totally against hate speech but I do believe in freedom of speech so therefore I believe the way forward is to have moderators regularly reviewing the comment section.
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading is unfair to the market
__label__Evidence	agree
__label__Evidence	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Evidence	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Evidence	we should adopt atheism as it will do away with religious intolerance and hatred, making the world a more peaceful and harmonious place
__label__Position	Against
__label__Position	This should be done with a mix of moderation, community flagging and reporting before moving to disabling comments, based ona mix of moderative judgement and amount of flagging
__label__Position	Newspaper websites should invest more in technology that can be used to detect hate speech and not allow it to be posted. They should only allow comments posted in the language that the software will understand so that it is able to eliminate hate speech without difficulties. they should also be willing to punish people who post hate speech by reporting them to the authorities.
__label__Evidence	wikipedia provides a great service which provides a safe place to find info on all types of topics
__label__Evidence	if someone is willing to sell an organ that should be their right
__label__Position	According to newsy.com, between January and March 2022, Meta took action on more than 15 million pieces of hate speech content on Facebook. Roughly 95% of that was detected proactively by Facebook with the help of AI - https://www.newsy.com/stories/artificial-intelligence-is-used-to-track-down-hate-speech/#:~:text=Between%20January%20and%20March%202022,themes%20fall%20through%20the%20cracks.
__label__Evidence	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Evidence	targeted killing saves lives. it reduces our boots on the ground, protecting more of our soldiers and lessens civilian casualties because there's not active war zones full of combact and soldiers.
__label__Evidence	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Position	Not only hate speech but also internalized stereotypes has awful effect on online discussions: Please check this article. Moderation is a great idea as informed mods can decrease both hate speech and internalized stereotypes in the comments: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-018-0941-5
__label__Evidence	libertarianism is a justification for greed and exploitation
__label__Evidence	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Evidence	they should not abolish zoos since many are in danger of extinction, which need strategic places for scientific study or the collection of funds to finance projects.
__label__Evidence	All in all, the newspaper comment section should not be cancelled.
__label__Evidence	Gun violence is a huge problem and there are too many mass shootings. If people didn't have guns many lives would be saved. Less suicides would happen too as guns are just too easy to use.
__label__Evidence	cannabis should be legalized because no link has been found to document a connection between cannabis use and mind altering drugs.
__label__Evidence	wikipedia provides an invaluable service and we need to secure its ability to exist in the near and distant future
__label__Evidence	executive compensation is abuse of unregulated capitalism and concentrates wealth into a very small number of people.
__label__Evidence	Sabarimala temple is taking funds from government and hence state government has the right to make changes in law for the temple.
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Evidence	we should because we can still learn so much about space.
__label__Evidence	eating fast food one time per week increased the risk of death by coronary heart disease by 20 percent
__label__Evidence	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Evidence	a multi-party is essential to allow for democracy and prevent autocratic regimes coming to power.
__label__Evidence	subsidizing student loans would allow access to funds above the means of the student and the financial consequences in the future, including higher interest rates would be financially detrimental.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Evidence	whaling is a barbaric practice that destroys majestic animals
__label__Position	I think that the warning system is a good route, as the AI might eliminate valid arguments and miss hate speech accidentally. A warning system would still need an AI, but it warns users that their comment may be hate speech and if it is, the user can rethink their wording or risk posting it. If they post it, maybe a manual review can happen to determine if it was hate speech or not.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Evidence	being forced to do anything inhibits freedom.

__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Evidence	Atheism is a valid form of thinking just as many controlled religions. We should adopt and accept it as we do with other beliefs.
__label__Position	Hate-speech is part of free-speech, it's hard to focus on one without affecting the other so what should be done is to write articles differently, a neutral way where both sides can see themselves because we become less aggressive when we feel part of a group
__label__Evidence	We need to ban targeted killing because it is murder and murder is illegal everywhere.
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Position	Taking an evidence based approach, it does seem that removing hate speech can reduce its effect, but it might drive its would be posters onto more extremeist online communities where they are able to reinforce their views. Thus it makes the views less acceptable, but reinforces and radicalises a small number. Thus, education and inclusivity of all- no matter their beliefs- has an important civic purpose.
__label__Evidence	Collectivism would be good in situations where it must be a group decision.
__label__Position	I don't think removing the comment spaceis a good idea, people should still be given a platform where they can voice themselves out. Having a team look through the comments and find those that include hate speach and remove them and maybe ban the people whith hatespeach comments from ever posting comments again.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	the government is putting us more and more into debt with wasteful spending and no real boundaries to it.
__label__Evidence	we should abolish intellectual property rights because it create more laws from the copyrights and keeping it protected

__label__Evidence	space exploration should be subsidized as it will benefit us in the future with technology advancements.
__label__Evidence	Newspapers by their nature are polarised entities. Banning comments to diminish polarised opinions makes little sense if the newspapers themselves are pumping out polarised opinions.
__label__Position	For some people, "Man made climate change" begs the question. While I might not be one of them, I'll say assuming climate change is indeed man made, all we can do is reduce our greenhouse gas generation. This will require the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources to be prioritized more than it currently is.
__label__Evidence	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Evidence	with proper guidance and protection, children can be a valuable asset to the artistic process.
__label__Evidence	Many people are being kidnapped for organs. Illegal human organ trafficking is in almost every country. Some poor people are selling organs. All these things are consequences of organs shortage.
__label__Position	I think in order to eliminate hate speech, the comment section itself must be completely eradicated to take a way all potential risk. Newspapers have the sole purpose of giving accurate depictions of current events, there is no responsibility for them to offer social commentary space. One only has to look at the hatred filled comments of the Daily Mail web pages to see the concerning language being used on a regular basis.
__label__Evidence	there is simply no need, there is enough money in journalism and plenty of valuable, objective sources available
__label__Evidence	being against solar energy, in my opinion, is simply irrational. Insects also die by windmills sometimes, but much more often from hunger, birds or herbicides, insecticides, etc.
__label__Position	There is some evidence that when hate speech increases in comments sections there is a difference in the linguistics used. Perhaps it would be possible to use artificial intelligence to pick up on this quicker than a moderator could.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	school prayer brings people together in fostering an atmosphere of peace and understanding, and should be seen as a message of universality rather than an appeal to a single religion.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	I believe people should be freely allowed to express their opinions on whatever form of information is presented to them. However, there is etiquette to everything we do. If you cannot produce a compelling argument without approaching the area of hate speech then the internet isn't for you. I believe in order to regulate these areas, participants and viewers should be informed of any rules and regulations to the newspaper website, then accepting or declining said rules will give you access. In the case of a violation of the rules, moderators should remove individuals from the space, essentially banning them as they did not follow the rules, in that case they will need to message an administrator to possibly receive access once again.
__label__Evidence	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Evidence	Would this not limit freedom of speech then ? people wont truly speak their minds if its being filtered first. Moderators would be given too much power ?
__label__Evidence	I think that would be unfair to other people who do not post hate speech.
__label__Evidence	missionary work often only benefits the missionary. those that are targeted are often left worse off after the missionary leaves, having been given a taste of first world things then left to rot
__label__Evidence	I agree
__label__Position	Readers should be able to comment but be informed of certain comments that would be considered hate speech. If they are aware and still choose to comment hateful words, the newspaper website should feel comfortable enough to remove those comments since the reader was informed that comments like those would not be acceptable.
__label__Evidence	The EU has some rules on how social security systems are coordinated (Regulation 883/2004/EC). EU rules ensure that the pension rights accrued in each country are added together and paid out by the pension insurance institution of the Member State of affiliation. But the bureaucratic nightmare is probably just as guaranteed. A better solution would be a transparent and digital platform that collects pension entitlements from all EU member states. That way, every citizen would have an overview of his or her pension entitlements at all times, not just until when they are due.

__label__Evidence	no one should be forced to do anything in our country.

__label__Evidence	I agree
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Evidence	cloning of organs can and will save many lives, people who need organ transplants could be saved by cloning organs for them rather than waiting for others to die, cloned limbs would also help disabled people.

__label__Evidence	embryonic research has proven effective in finding cures for many diseases such as cancer.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Evidence	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Evidence	gender-neutral language would show we respect peoples choices.
__label__Evidence	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Evidence	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Evidence	India is the second most populous country in the world. It is already difficult for the Indian government to provide food security and basic necessities to all the people of India. Adding more burden to this will worsen the situation.
__label__Position	removing a comments section isn't hindering free speech. You still have the freedom to make your own post about the topic, you can even share the article in question that you would have commented on. There are still social media groups in which you can discuss your views openly. The media source that posted the article isn't reading and responding to the comments section so there is no point in a comments section except for random people to argue or agree with each other.
__label__Evidence	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Position	Personally I think it would require a well developed algorithm moderated by a team that updates it regularly to make sure it flags the correct material and continually updates it's database of words, phrases and dogwhistles

__label__Evidence	legal organ trade would help prevent wait lists
__label__Evidence	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Evidence	It does take away freedom of speech on the website
__label__Evidence	We should adopt a zero-tolerance policy in schools as children of school age are in a formative state and will learn good lessons for life including what is and isn't allowed in a good society.

__label__Position	We should increase the legal warranty from 2 years to 5 years on all products in Europe
__label__Evidence	If the information was moderated & hidden if deemed to be hate speech then it would still exist for the purposes of feedback but not be visible within the comments section
__label__Evidence	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Evidence	intellectual property rights prevent the free flow of information and innovation, and should be abolished.
__label__Evidence	we should allow science to further their research even if it includes human cloning.
__label__Evidence	however these policies can impede the advancement of children from troubled backgrounds or with additional needs. they need a safe place to learn in a positive behaviours in a supportive environment.
__label__Evidence	I believe you are referencing an AI, but that would require certain technology and datasets for it to understand what to look for. You can also argue that hateful words can be used in a certain context to argue a point, rather than as a directly hateful comment.

__label__Evidence	wikipedia is a very unreliable source of information. many schools do not allow wikipedia to be used as a valid source for term papers.
__label__Evidence	I think that having these echo chambers just perpetuates what may be a cognitive dissonance, you may not necessarily feel a certain way but a comment you put out may have be interpreted one way and subsequent comments would reinforce that viewpoint in a polarised echo chamber. This website explains it nicely and uses racisms as an example of how cognitive dissonance perpetuates racist behaviour. https://www.reallifepsych.com/single-post/2017/08/16/the-psychology-of-cognitive-dissonance-and-racism
__label__Position	hate speech must be clearly defined, it should not be left to the media to decide what is and is not considered hate speech
__label__Evidence	missionary work tries to inflict other's beliefs onto people in more vulnerable circumstances.
__label__Evidence	there's no need to ban algorithmic trading as it is a very good system for trading, leading to great gains for the investors.
__label__Position	I agree with this, in that the public should have a say in the newspaper. However, I feel, that random members of the public could be unpredictable and could comment hateful things in the space.
__label__Evidence	cannabis creates a stoner subculture which is a blight on our society.
__label__Evidence	the olympic games inspire children and people of all ages to enjoy and participate in sports.
__label__Evidence	Using child actors only makes them more susceptible to drug use later on.

__label__Evidence	people who have no clue about the issues and people who are not into politics would be voting for someone they know nothing about.
__label__Evidence	Discriminatory words could be automatically blocked which will certainly reduce hate speech to some extent
__label__Evidence	obesity is at epidemic levels. it effects everyone by overburdening medical providers and drives up everyone's insurance rates
__label__Evidence	To prevent the violation of human rights, four-stage scrutiny is added. Designating individuals as terrorists is not started by India. The US, European Union, and China also have this provision.
__label__Position	There absolutely are ways to facilitate healthy conversation and debates without allowing hate speech. Both algorithms and human moderation are ways to ensure debate can continue without resorting to abuse.
__label__Evidence	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Evidence	we should not stop the development of autonomous cars because it will help the people more easily on driving and will provide more safety.

__label__Position	The Sabarimala verdict is progressive and not a threat to traditions
__label__Evidence	I think in the cases of newspapers, the hateful comments can be removed before print. If it's an online platform then said user can be shadowed
__label__Evidence	It has been seen that it is difficult to retain employees in lean times when they are on variable pay schemes. Workers who receive commissions do well when business is good, but they do poorly when business is bad. In times of slow business, even top salespeople might have difficulty making enough sales to earn a decent living. If the market is slow and commissioned workers can’t earn enough, they may look for other employment opportunities. In lean times, fixed wages can be more effective at keeping employees from leaving for other opportunities.
__label__Evidence	if we ban missionary work, then a lot less people would be seeing propaganda.
__label__Evidence	Whale meat has high levels of mercury and is unhealthy as part of a diet.
__label__Evidence	nuclear weapons should be abolished because it brings us one step closer to a nuclear war
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	I have no knowledge to share, but perhaps I can use that positively by posing a few 'stupid' questions: - What are the threats to heritage buildings from climate change? - What are the threats to climate change from heritage buildings?
__label__Evidence	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Position	Alongside moderators and verification of profiles, I think offensive language should be immediately recognised by the system and disallow users from posting and/or move their comment to a 'moderator' section to double check the context first.
__label__Position	Defining "hate" speech is difficult. A good starting point is The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (summarised on Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_laws_in_the_United_Kingdom ) but I would strongly suggest looking at the original source in English Law.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Evidence	I agree that real time moderation
__label__Position	I think it's important to remember that free speech doesn't remove consequences of that speech but people who may have views which the majority of people don't support are rarely coming at it with an intention of 'hate' and having the difficult discussions might be the only way they will be exposed to the information which might change their thinking

__label__Evidence	Human cloning could provide a great benefit to mankind by eradicating illnesses and disease through replication of people known to be fit, well and healthy.
__label__Position	I believe that we could also find a legal solution for reducing hate speech. I believe we need a new legislation particularly for hate speech in the Internet. When people knew that hate speech could be criminal offence, most of them would not post it.
__label__Evidence	I agree
__label__Evidence	cloning human beings goes against nature with which we could have serious consequences in the future
__label__Evidence	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Evidence	I completely agree with this and this might also allow journalist to engage with their readers. I found this study to be really interesting about how the majority of journalists that were interviewed found values in comments.
__label__Evidence	we already are in high enough debt, we don't need to make it worse be subsidizing pointless things.
__label__Evidence	Gas power plants produce CO2. Climate-damaging methane is released during extraction and transport, nuclear power plants produce radioactive waste - a legacy for future generations - not to mention the current danger of release, e.g. through attacks, geological events, or operational accidents due to human or technical errors.
__label__Evidence	telemarketing should be banned because it is just plain annoying. if someone really wants a product they will go buy it and not wait for someone to call them about it.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Position	Maybe if there is a surplus of messages left then all foulmouth comments could be sifted out, allthough i agree this could leed to bias
__label__Evidence	no opportunity to discuss topics
__label__Evidence	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Evidence	child actors are put through too much at too young. we should do away with them and just use cgi or something like that. if a big company can call a cgi movie live action and get away with it, it will work.

__label__Evidence	missionary work is funded by multibillionaires and serves to only enrich the lives of those that are already rich.
__label__Position	a system where people have to submit personal information before they can post a comment is a good idea. This could be reduce hate speech.
__label__Position	Maybe the only solution is to remove the space for comments? We see the same issues on other platforms that allow comments!
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Evidence	Hey! This looks like slippery slope type of thinking
__label__Position	Immigrants should learn the language of their host country.
__label__Evidence	I agree, that feels like a reasonable approach. Although I'm a little bit skeptical what comes to its effectivity.
__label__Position	maybe if certain words are used, they are recognized and the post cant be posted.
__label__Evidence	The incentive to provide free public transport in European cities in the future would make it easier for people, especially in the cities, to accept and appreciate that there will be fewer and fewer cars. People who benefit from current examples are happy about it.
__label__Evidence	We see this problem in many countries and the situation is getting worse - the pandemic, also, took its toll. Stable quality jobs and adequate social protection are necessary if we don't want to see a great strain on social systems in the long term.

__label__Evidence	By 'standards', maybe certain words should be blocked? Users who continue to post blocked words eventually being banned.

__label__Evidence	By making rules we might lose some viewers.
__label__Evidence	There’s a psychological effect where being presented with information, even in the context of given facts of“this is wrong and inaccurate” actually reinforces the belief in that information if you already made up your mind on the issue.

__label__Evidence	As much as I would *like to* agree, I unfortunately cannot. Free speech still IS a part of free speech. I'm afraid you can't have one or the other - they are co-dependent as I believe, humans are inherently seeking conflict.
__label__Evidence	people should be free to worship and pray in any way that they choose, it is a fundamental right.
__label__Evidence	atheism is simply the end result of rational thinking, refusing to blindly believe in things that are unproven - this is healthier attitude, since religious adherence leads to all mannor of intolerance.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Evidence	Mandatory retirement forces people who are still excellent at their jobs to quit working long before they are ready.
__label__Position	Nepotism exists in Bollywood
__label__Evidence	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Evidence	safe spaces are sometimes the only place at-risk kids have that make them feel safe.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars are prohibitively expensive
__label__Evidence	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Evidence	private military companies do not all follow the rules of the country
__label__Evidence	we should not ban the use of child actors because it would be awfully strange to watch programs and never see a child as that is not real life.
__label__Evidence	a zero-tolerance policy in schools shows children that the schools are not playing around when it comes to punishment
__label__Evidence	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	Unfortunately the definition of hate speech differs from country to country and in some, they exclude certain races, certain groups, and the list go on. The UN has a guideline of what hate speech is, but again, someone commenting from another country does not really see that as hate speech, while the other do. Again, this is where AI technology is not such a good idea to moderate a platform. I do think that hate speech has become so broad in some countries that one can not say anything, or someone takes offence. So, what do one do, well, do not get personal. I agree with NormanW that they can disable comments when a topic is sensitive. That will avoid personalized comments. I agree also with JenniferP, hate speech should not be tolerated, but that does not mean you must take offence if a comment is not directed at you. Do not take every comment personal. I am the older generation, and we use to keep our opinions non personal and use to RESPECT people and their opinions. But times has changed and here we are. I still would like to see peoples opinion and agree with moderation by REAL people of NON bias status.
__label__Evidence	fast food should not be banned as it is comforting, allows for social events and interaction and is enjoyed by many
__label__Evidence	compulsory voting would ensure that voting is fair and equal
__label__Evidence	Organ trading would pressure poor people to take great risks with their bodies in exchange for short term gains; it is an unfair position to put them in.
__label__Position	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.

__label__Evidence	Because pretending as if it's not happening doesnt mean it will stop when there is a disable comment.
__label__Evidence	Reducing freedom of speech is never good and using an algorithm can be helpful, however it opens a whole group of structural problems, when not all hate speech is treated equally. https://time.com/5739688/facebook-hate-speech-languages/
__label__Evidence	All workers and unemployed should have access to social protection, including young people. It is embedded in the core principle of the European Pillar of Social Rights, but those high and lofty principles must become a reality for all workers, old and young!
__label__Position	I agree with this.
__label__Evidence	I agree, everybody has freedom of speech and we all have to right to access t information.

__label__Evidence	to be able to provide a stable economy, an austerity regime is necessary to operate on a balanced budget.
__label__Position	This link shows that in 2020 Facebook reported that exposure to hate speech was only 0.11% which I think is a pretty good argument for not putting a blanket ban on comments sections https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/what-is-online-hate-crime/
__label__Evidence	fast food is sometimes the only way poor people can feed their families cheaply. if you ban it then you are taking away someone's only meal.
__label__Position	Freedom of speech is important but it should not infringe on other people's rights. Hate speech does infringe on other people's rights but this should not affect people who also use the website to comment.
__label__Position	We should have all workers working in private enterprises share equity in the company they work for
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars will cause unemployment for people whose only skill is driving.
__label__Evidence	some children may require cosmetic surgery for health reasons, such as a cleft palate, therefore it should not be banned.
__label__Evidence	Nothing
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	In the digital world we live in - unfortunately hate speech is part and parcel of the benefits of having such an open forum and allowing everyone to have a voice. Hate speech is made by a minuscule minority of people. Perhaps have a 'report hate speech' button that members of the community can use.
__label__Evidence	we should legalize prostitution because freedom should be absolute. if i wish to make money having sex, i should have that right. having it legal will reduce the violence and increase safety.
__label__Evidence	Gender selection is an extremely expensive medical process.
__label__Evidence	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Evidence	we should limit judicial activism since that leads to civil unrest do to the nature of activists.
__label__Evidence	mandatory uniform policies denying parents rights to raise children without government intervention
__label__Evidence	people have a right to be able to defend themselves and their loved ones
__label__Position	Readers comments are an important space and whilst it's possible that people use them for hate speech, others use them to express informed opinions and for healthy debate.
__label__Evidence	we have the right to practice whatever religion we want and the church of scientology is a form of religion.
__label__Evidence	it makes a mockery of voting for your political party of choice if the end result is a multi-party system which will lead to people not voting if they feel they do not have a say.
__label__Evidence	I agree that removing comments is not a good idea.
__label__Position	Hate speech is so prevalent nowadays that proper measures should be taken in order to limit these harmful comments. However to stop people from expressing their opinions is creating another problem altogether. Those who aren't able to make help contributions should be blocked and stripped of their right to do so.
__label__Evidence	intellectual property rights are important as it gives economic incentive for their creation and helps to stimulate innovation and contribute to the technological progress of countries.
__label__Evidence	The idea of using AI algorithms to combat hate speech is an attractive one. However, using experience of Facebook, it's clear that AI systems are still not advanced enough to undertake this task without human oversight. Facebook often censors posts or comments unfairly because its AI algorithms doesn't understand the context. In short, I don't believe we can get away without using humans to check the flagged comments at least.
__label__Position	The EU should take responsibility for global environmental and climate policy
__label__Evidence	Halt all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries into the EU.
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Evidence	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Evidence	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Evidence	some people have committed such unspeakable crimes that they don't deserve to live
__label__Evidence	child actors are needed in all types of film and movies and therefore should not be banned.
__label__Evidence	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Evidence	I agree with this. With that being said, we as consumers need to demand more from the same organizations. We need to go to all levels of government and demand that these same organizations give us alternatives in the form of electric and hydro cars while also proving that we are ready to purchase them to give these same organizations incentive to play along.
__label__Evidence	I agree
__label__Evidence	by allowing citizens to own guns, the chances of these weapons being stolen by criminals is increased, allowing guns to fall into the wrong hands would be disastrous

__label__Evidence	"Enticing people coming out of school to get into the sector, we need to make it sexy" (Paul Norman)
__label__Evidence	compulsory voting will represent all of the people not only those who already vote
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Evidence	we should ban it because it gives people a unrealistic view on how a natural body or face should look.
__label__Evidence	However, I tend to agree with this opinion: https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/why-ending-anonymity-would-not-make-social-media-better.php . I don't think hate speech will end with the end of anonymity. We have to think about the possibilities of safety for human rights activists that only come with anonimity.
__label__Position	I think we can have proactive crowd voting or send to moderator functions, to ensure a timely removal items could be hidden if several votes are received over time.
__label__Evidence	in a certain way, the selective assassination in politics is beneficial for countries that have this, as a means to alleviate their problems
__label__Evidence	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Evidence	judicial activism is an important part of our country.
__label__Evidence	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Evidence	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Evidence	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Position	I fairly believe that the biggest issue at hand is the meaning behind freedom of speech and hate speech. Whenever people do post or write things that are hate speech, they hide behind the principle of freedom of speech. Newspapers and websites must be able to monitor and get opinions from the public about what to remove. Comment sections are really important to socialize and allow thought-provoking questions and ideas.

__label__Evidence	space exploration advances the frontiers of mankind, and could well discover new resources that will be invaluable due to the depletion of those on earth.
__label__Evidence	In the book "Noise" it talks about taking the median for everyones view and making that the regulation. The conversation then becomes which views qualify as each end of this opinion spectrum? Surely not the hateful ones but a modicum of their views so they feel included instead of fuelling their distrust of systems not built for them.
__label__Evidence	there are not enough safe-guards that oversee private military companies from producing under-par products and they should be banned.
__label__Evidence	hate speech is discrimination, but people should be free to express themselves on websites because not every comment will be hate speech and other people inspire other from comments, without the comment space people will be unable to interact online.
__label__Position	i believe comment are important, to allow people to discuss. sometimes you can get factual information from other people comments
__label__Evidence	agree
__label__Position	We should use the waste from the agri-food industry in the ruminant feed chain
__label__Evidence	I think this is a good idea, but people have a way of getting around these filters by using different fonts or characters that cannot be read by the filter bots.
__label__Evidence	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Evidence	Due to their technological nature, neo-banks do not need any physical bank branches, which helps them save on overhead costs (the cost of running the business). Thus, neo-banks are able to offer lower fees and higher interest rates on checking and savings accounts to customers.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Position	Reduce the anonymity that hate-speech writers can hide behind - without that shield some may be less inclined to post because it can be traced back to them

__label__Evidence	some people just don't have an opinion about who to vote for
__label__Evidence	I think the fact that Facebook, one of the richest companies in the world, struggle with moderation points to the fact that small local newspapers would struggle. Especially if one of their stores goes viral or something.
__label__Evidence	we should be able to share love, this world needs that
__label__Evidence	It is important to see immigrants as people who have a culture, a religious perspective, and a very different but respectable idea of sociality compared to the European one. That's why we must act in a coordinated and careful manner between institutions and organizations.
__label__Evidence	This could be done through public opinion, such as what the general public would consider less restricted and what is acceptable in current society.
__label__Evidence	Legalizing prostitution won't do away with it, it will just make it more prevalent and will push more people to sell their body.
__label__Evidence	we are all responsible for doing our part in getting the books back in the black
__label__Evidence	someone should be able to continue working if they want, despite their age.
__label__Evidence	we should oppose collectivism because it creates echo chambers in societies that makes it harder for individuals to give their thoughts and opinions on things

__label__Evidence	an austerity regime has never been shown to work because there is always someone who insists that his project must be funded
__label__Evidence	legalizing the organ trade would provide life saving options for all people not just the wealthy ones who can afford to buy them on the black market.
__label__Evidence	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.

__label__Evidence	Unity needs time. Poland and Hungary etc. need to enjoy their freedom for now. They will eventually see that working together with civilized countries is more attractive in the end.
__label__Evidence	targeted killing shouldnt be banned if its used in the right context as in the case of terrorists who might be killing innocent people
__label__Evidence	compulsory voting will cause more people to take an interest in politics which, in turn, will benefit everyone
__label__Evidence	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Evidence	Fast food is leading to a major increase in obesity and other health issues in the U.S.
__label__Evidence	we should not abolish the three-strikes laws but we could improve them so that people who have committed only a minor offence are not jailed for life.
__label__Evidence	adopting now an austerity regime will help future generations to cope with the limited resources we have.
__label__Position	I think one way of eliminating hate speech is to filter the comment section by certain words that are considered hateful. We obviously can not control what people do but by filtering the comment section we can limit what people can and can not say.
__label__Position	End impunity for hate crimes: Newsroom monitoring and evaluation teams can help combat impunity for hate crimes. The goal of these groups would then be to track patterns in hate speech, compile reports, and alert important institutions and the civil society to them.
__label__Evidence	While I see the logic to this argument, the publics interaction with paper newspapers and slower press looks to have declined according to this article, therefore I'm not sure this solution would work: https://clubs.waketech.edu/wake-review/magazine/creative-writing/non-fiction/the-decline-in-newspapers-a-closer-look-joseph-ahrens/
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

__label__Evidence	https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/04/1025742/ai-hate-speech-moderation/ It is (at least for the moment) not really possible for an AI to filter out hate speech efficiently. https://hai.stanford.edu/news/why-ai-struggles-recognize-toxic-speech-social-media
__label__Position	I think everyone raised some good points already, but overall, it seems to be that some moderation is required no matter what, and that might be too costly for some smaller platforms to implement.
__label__Evidence	pride parades cause violence and hate
__label__Evidence	adopting atheism would violate freedom of religion
__label__Evidence	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Evidence	hate speech is a real problem and enabling it to freely exist on the internet can lead to a variety of issues including mental health problems for the person its directed at.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Position	Space on comments is a must have because many users get to participate into a good course that could help many others and therefore those spewing hate should be harshly dealt with. Blocked actively so
__label__Evidence	I agree, hate speech needs to be dealt with from the root of the problem, it is not the responsibility of news services to police this.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people.

__label__Evidence	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Evidence	minors don't understand the implications of their choices
__label__Evidence	the three-strikes laws can keep some people from having a chance to get out and reform themselves.
__label__Evidence	banning all cosmetic surgery for minors is not the way we need to go. there are too many reasons a minor might need it done, such as injury or deformity.
__label__Evidence	intellectual properties allow large corporations to have monopolies over their products and restrict the free market.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Position	Comments on newspapers should be there for people to voice out their thoughts about certain topics because that is the only way to learn and interact with each other therefore the should be measures taken to monetize people's comment and delete those that are hate speech and irrelevant to that topic.
__label__Evidence	somebody was working hard to make something and then should be rewarded for it. that`s what intellectual property rights all about.
__label__Evidence	cosmetic surgery gives you the assurance you were lacking physically
__label__Evidence	atheism is a helpful belief, if everybody adopted it there would be no wars
__label__Evidence	However, there are often ways to get around automatic moderation, and manually completed moderation would use a large amount of man hours and money
__label__Evidence	i agree with the comment about fake news, a lot of people reading online articles are vulnerable to taking information at face value without checking whether or not there is actual evidence for this
__label__Evidence	Self-determination is a basic collective human right. Catalans practiced this right in 2017. Since then the Catalan Republic is kidnaped by Spanish lawfare, with the elected president Puigdemont in exile within Europe and more than 3000 Catalan activists suffering political persecution as a consequence. Ignoring this conflict within the core of Europe by European Institutions can undermine the EU at its very start. If you sincerely believe in human rights, recognize the Catalan Republic officially. This crucial step will enforce European democracy, the Democracy of Citizens that feel free and respected within European borders.

__label__Evidence	we should not abandon the use of school uniforms because it helps to create a fair and even playing field between students who are rich and poor alike.
__label__Position	I agree that it all should be reviewed before it is published
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Position	The EU should develop a European Youth Platform for mental health
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Evidence	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments

__label__Evidence	the drive around cosmetic surgery and body modification of minor should be nipped in the bud. a minor should be concerned about academics not cosmetics.
__label__Position	The EU should establish a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)
__label__Position	We should enforce the rule of law, promoting respect for human rights without linking them to any alleged “European” identity.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	space exploration doesn't have any immediate benefits for the general public

__label__Evidence	embryonic stem cell research is murder
__label__Evidence	removing certain words would definitely prevent people from purposely stirring up hatred through the comment speech
__label__Evidence	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Evidence	I think the only way to stop this would be to review all comments before they are published and delete anything that is hate speech.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars will help prevent wrecks in the future.
__label__Evidence	we should fund journalism to serve the public interest.
__label__Evidence	the government doesnt need to be in control of science
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Evidence	That's a very good point and thanks for pointing out what it's called. I learned something new today! I have seen countless times in anti (fill in blank) groups that use asterisks and other characters to write out otherwise blocked words. They get around the system.
__label__Evidence	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, and it is all of our jobs to try to stop it.
__label__Position	A lot of people may lose their jobs due to AI
__label__Evidence	I think the problem in the EU is the incompetence to establish inventions in the market. There are lots of inventions that are made and funded by public EU research facilities brought into the market by small startups. In the end, they are picked like ripe fruits by the US or Chinese companies where the big money is made.
__label__Evidence	During the pandemic, the EU was unable to produce a vaccine on its own, mainly due to the fact that not enough money is invested in research within its different member states. Gathering the strength of the 27 member states in research and health could be a real asset for the EU and its citizens, but also for its influence overseas and its independence.
__label__Evidence	It could help return newspapers to places where people seek news rather than skip content to get to simply debate/abuse!

__label__Evidence	factory farming provides a faster mass production of food and gives us a way to feed more people than we would if we banned it. there will be less hunger in the world so we shouldn't ban it.
__label__Evidence	they will lead to more deaths on the roads
__label__Evidence	What are you 5? And what do you mean by first-world? Should we create a task force just to understand what countries are to be considered the first world? Is it the money? The religion? The food? Their political system? And then reevaluate each year? This comment is plain ignorant.
__label__Position	The use of public defenders should be mandatory

__label__Evidence	economic sanctions cause death and suffering for civilain populations, and are wildly unfocused as a tool of diplomacy.
__label__Evidence	in a competitive market companies have to attract the best talent
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading can cause unnatural market movements.
__label__Evidence	The current subsidies with a modular system of incentives should be replaced, as that empowers farmers to choose environmentally, socially, and financially responsible and sustainable solutions that are already available - like natural sequence farming, regenerative agriculture, permaculture, etc.
__label__Evidence	we should not abolish the right to keep and bear arms because it is a constitutional right to own weapons to protect ourselves.
__label__Evidence	I agree, and this can be further enocouraged if the writerr or journalist engages with the comments that are being made on their story
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Evidence	wikipedia is too vulnerable to manipulation to be considered a trusted source.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Evidence	The same technology that allows social media to galvanise democratic activists can be used by hate groups seeking to organise and recruit. It also allows fringe sites, including peddlers of conspiracies, to reach audiences far broader than their core readership. Online platforms’ business models depend on maximising reading or viewing times. Since Facebook and similar platforms make their money by enabling advertisers to target audiences with extreme precision, it is in their interests to let people find the communities where they will spend the most time.https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons
__label__Position	there must be a code of conduct which is publicly accessible to write a comment. comment themselves could have button on where any other person could consider the comment to behateful with a points system in place
__label__Evidence	When newspapers worry more about the bottom line than the headlines, the quality of the papers goes down resulting in poor pop journalism that panders to the public and the advertisers.
__label__Evidence	animals in factory farms are kept in terrible conditions and we need to stop this
__label__Evidence	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Evidence	"Government consistency re traditional buildings"
__label__Evidence	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Evidence	you can not force a religion or lack there of on someone
__label__Evidence	this law is unfair to those who's third crime is minor and thought should be given to changing the criteria of the third crime.
__label__Evidence	we should ban factory farming as it poses a huge health risk by passing on diseases and bacteria to people.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Position	Education in media ethics: The first step in combating tribalized hate speech is realizing that, while the right to free expression is a fundamental human right, the rise of social media has produced a number of different channels for its creation, packaging, and transmission. The rights and liberties of journalists and their role in fostering and developing peaceful societies should be emphasized in media ethics education. The political, social, and cultural rights of individuals and groups, including the freedom of expression, must be made more widely known, as well as the obligations and societal repercussions that come with press freedom. Journalists need to have the knowledge and abilities to spot hate speech and disseminate anti-hate messaging.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars are computerized and are open to hacking. at that point they can become a dangerous weapon to not only the driver but everyone around him.
__label__Evidence	I disagree - people should comment where it is appropriate but not on topics where the public is largely misinformed or can spread misinformation such as climate change. Comments on topics like celebrities are ok because they ultimately don't matter when compared to an important science-policy debate.
__label__Evidence	That was COP25, I believe in this discussion we are trying to focus on COP26
__label__Evidence	activists judges aren't the ones shaping the laws. they're not "all" the people for who the laws are voted for. judicial activism has to be limited to only check for overuse of the power by governments
__label__Position	Newspapers are already heavily censored and is not a platform for free speech. Whoever moderates the comments section (be it an algorithm (and by proxy the person creating the algorithm) or a person) will always provide their own bias to the moderation.
__label__Evidence	economic sanctions affect poor people more than governments
__label__Position	We need to hold websites and social media platforms responsible for hate speech. This is especially important for large platforms with significant influence (e.g., twitter, youtube, facebook).
__label__Evidence	telemarketing is an irritant, a waste of time, and gives too many people spam calls which isn't helpful when the person is waiting for a phone call from a potential employer, etc.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Evidence	this is a free country and citizens should have the right to vote or not to vote.
__label__Position	By blocking comments with offensive words related to the topic, and banning individuals who constantly engage in hate speech.
__label__Evidence	Requiring people to give a lot of information about themselves in order to give their opinion online is NOT a direction we should be going in. Moderators are fine; requiring people to dox themselves so they can be educated is not it.

__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Evidence	We should not adopt an austerity regime because this move hurt people that are living on their pensions and people pay more taxes and this hurt a lot of people
__label__Position	From reader others opinions, it feels like the ability and freedom to comment should not be taken away because of a few people that post troll or hate comments, which means the comment section should stay. But the comments that are posted have to be monitored (maybe by an AI or bot) and also be reportable by other users. I think a fair implementation would be to only allow registered site users to post comments
__label__Position	We should legalize organ trade
__label__Evidence	subsidizing wikipedia could be a back gateway to some form of governmental control, debasing the validity of the articles and information provided.
__label__Evidence	to keep wikipedia impartial there ought to be no subsidies provided
__label__Evidence	Ensure equal opportunities for girls and women, provide them sufficient maternity leave, and institute guarantees that will protect women's careers who choose to have children. Those are the steps we need, and most EU countries already have them (not that they cannot be improved). There's absolutely no need for quotas.
__label__Evidence	Students work hard to score well in class 12 exams, but all that hard work is not recognized. And only the NEET score is considered for entry into medical college, which is very unfair. Moreover, the NEET exam is mainly based on the CBSE curriculum. So, state board students have to study additional things to get a good score on the exam.
__label__Evidence	subsidizing journalism allows more voices to be heard
__label__Position	readers are always reading for knowledge of something new, something exciting and adventurous and this sometimes make them want to ad more to express their feeling to the writer. These feeling will not always be seen as good comments because some people are born careless about other people's feeling and they write as they please. I say this platform called "bcause" already has the perfect option on how to use the comment section perfectly and this is to use the option of "PROS AND CONS"
__label__Position	We know from many studies that anonymity is a dangerous tool (https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-24373-001) that can cause people to agress in a way unusual to their regular behavior, what exacerbates this is when you see other people doing it also, it causes a sort of mob mentality (https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannecroteau/2019/02/01/our-society-is-broken-lets-fix-it/). So removing hate speech by using a flag system in tandem with moderatos wouldn't just help those who may be affected by it but also dissuade cruel people from commenting something unkind.
__label__Position	What about allowing the comment section, but having a built-in screener running in the background, that automatically prevents posts with certain hateful words it is built to detect?
__label__Evidence	private military companies are a threat to our democracy and should not be tolerated anymore
__label__Evidence	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Evidence	economic sanctions help punish bad behavior
__label__Evidence	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Evidence	Unmoderated online comment forums are magnets for noxious speech. For years they have carried people’s discontent out into the world, while the writers sit safely behind screens. It’s almost bittersweet to think back on the time we once blamed internet flaming on the online disinhibition of middle school pranksters. It is the many unhappy adults in the electorate who are posting the things they are really thinking in comment boxes. Nearly three-quarters of internet users – 73 percent – have witnessed online harassment. News website comment sections host antagonistic conversations between contributors. Nine out of 10 respondents of a Pew Research study said the online environment was more enabling of criticism. The squabbling can be overwhelming: As many as 34 percent of news commenters and 41 percent of news comment readers identified argumentative comments as the reason they avoid reading or joining the discourse. Multiple studies show online communities develop sophisticated norms that guide participants. Anger begets more anger. Unshackled digital vitriol is now volleyed back and forth online from all sides. Some commenters don’t even care if they are anonymous anymore. Researchers have found real-name comments on social media are actually nastier than unsigned commentary. Historically, American democracy always had some rudeness baked into it. For example, during the presidential election of 1800, incumbent President John Adams’ campaign proclaimed “murder, robbery, rape, adultery and incest will all be openly taught and practiced” if his opponent, Thomas Jefferson, won the presidency. Jefferson, meanwhile, described Adams as “a hideous hermaphroditical character,” with “neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman.” Civility in public discourse is often what people in power expect of their citizens. Demands for civility can be used by those with authority to deny power to those with none. People who feel marginalized or alienated use incivility and civil disobedience to fight the power. By causing offense and indignation, as we saw during Campaign 2016, outsiders gained massive attention for their cause. Yet “democracy only functions when its participants abide by certain conventions, certain codes of conduct and a respect for the process,” wrote cultural journalist Neal Gabler in an eloquent essay about how a hateful electorate threatens democracy. Gabler noted that the 2016 presidential campaign was referred to as the “hate election” because everyone professed to hate both candidates. It turned out to be the hate election, Gabler mused, “because of the hatefulness of the electorate.” He went on:
__label__Evidence	Almost 3 lakh people were employed in the firecracker industry in these places, and 5 lakh people in packaging, transporting, distributing, and selling these crackers. Thus, the ban would also mean huge unemployment in these states.

__label__Evidence	private military companies provide additional soldiers in places where it is necessary
__label__Position	I don't think removing the comment spaceis a good idea, people should still be given a platform where they can voice themselves out. Having a team look through the comments and find those that include hate speach and remove them and maybe ban the people whith hatespeach comments from ever posting comments again.

__label__Evidence	people would sell organs because to them money is more important than health, putting them at risk.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Evidence	the church of scientology is a choice of religion by many and a constitutional right to freedom of religion that needs to be upheld and respected.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Evidence	nobody should own the intellectual works because we are not 100% sure that they have not been stolen
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	The EU should play a major role in a multipolar world
__label__Evidence	human cloning lets people play god.

__label__Evidence	EVERYONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO PRAY IF THEY WANT TO WEATHER IN SCHOOL OR IN A CHURCH
__label__Evidence	This is a very good point. And will make the reading experience pleasant. Another method that can combat hate speech is education. When it comes to bullying, cyberbullying, harassment, and hate crimes, the more people are educated on these issues, the more we can prevent them in the future.
__label__Evidence	we should not adopt atheism because organized religion instills good morals into people.
__label__Evidence	Absolutely, if you are discussing the topic at hand - articles are meant to engage readers and grab their attention.
__label__Position	The hate speech would obviously be reduced. However, if the comment section is totally removed, the rest of the comments which are important for knowing the opinions of the readers would also be removed.
__label__Evidence	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Position	The algorithm should have code that detects certain hate speech words and shadow bans them so as they do not appear on the site. with a warning that it will happen if the post is posted.
__label__Evidence	wikipedia plays a vital role in sharing information on the internet, and should be subsidized to continue functioning
__label__Evidence	we should not do this because other countries like china already did and it caused an epidemic where there is a huge imbalance of males to females which disrupts the population
__label__Evidence	i agree with this one
__label__Evidence	The EU needs to focus on simplifying and standardizing European processes and procedures associated with public management and creating efficient and effective anti-corruption mechanisms. This will reduce the financial resources to be made available to the most relevant areas of intervention at the EU, country, and regional Levels.

__label__Evidence	Democracy dies in darkness. Commentary on news was made to spark debate and deeper thought about new events. I feel something is lost if we remove this feature from news articles.
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't get rid of the olympics because it unites countries and gives everyone something in common.
__label__Evidence	The World, in particular Africa and the Middle East, is experiencing a huge population explosion. They seem not to be able to cope with it as China did. Who is going to take all these millions of refugees which result from it? Also, consider that the integration of one non-western immigrant costs 167.000 euros. If the EU intends to survive it has to stop more or less all migration.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Evidence	freedom of religion is one of the most basic human rights that exist. just because someone else might not believe in scientology doesn't give them the right to say someone else can't believe.

__label__Evidence	far too few people actually vote, meaning that those in government are not truly representative of the people.
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.

__label__Position	Online comment sections provide a space for the public to interact with news, to express their opinions, and to learn about others’ views. https://mediaengagement.org/research/survey-of-commenters-and-comment-readers/
__label__Evidence	Agree with the freedom of speech curtailing. But hate speech can be avoided while also expressing opinions.
__label__Evidence	With all the data and algorithms our apps and gadgets, without our conscious knowledge, are making decisions for us. Decision-making is (was) one of the qualities that made humans different from others
__label__Evidence	missionary work allows people in developing countries access to new ways of thinking and possibilities for how they live their life.

__label__Evidence	the three-strikes law is a powerful deterrent that acts as a fixed punishment for people not to develop a life of crime as they are always aware of the power of the law and the fixed penalty.
__label__Position	Sustainable efforts reduce and reverse the global warming trend.
__label__Position	Certain guidelines should be set and regulated to ensure they are being followed. Just as is done on plenty social media platforms. Any instances of prejudice or hate speech whether meant with no harm or ill intentions should be removed. Also an approval system can be set in place, so comments from readers can go through a filtration system before being posted.
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading can do a job that humans are not able to do
__label__Evidence	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	You have to log on to write a comment, having character/post limits, comments must be verified by someone who checks for hate speech before approving the comment for publication
__label__Position	I stand by my position of a moderator system
__label__Position	I think it is ok to remove the comments. There are other places people can go to express opinions.
__label__Evidence	a multi-party system would be too confusing
__label__Evidence	atheism fosters intellectual and human development and we must adopt it
__label__Evidence	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Position	We can reduce hate speech by having a team of moderators view the postings before publishing to make sure that there is no hate speech included. Another way is for the readers to flag any hate speech as in appropriate for the moderators to review.
__label__Evidence	We should not abolish safe spaces because sometimes limits on certain types of speech are necessary to preserve other types of speech.
__label__Evidence	we should adopt atheism because for decades we have proven with science that religious explanations are incorrect
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Position	Why free speech is important. https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/freedom-of-expression/
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	There should be 6 concrete proposals for migrants on the Balkan route.
__label__Evidence	The hub could also organize events to spread awareness in the local population on topics related to migration, in order to boost social inclusion processes and fight the spreading of fake news and ostracism of migrant people.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	that's why I think is important for readers to have a limit on what to say

__label__Evidence	we should subsidize embryonic stem cell research because it is necessary for the betterment of the human race. we may find cures for aging, diseases, or create new stronger genes.
__label__Evidence	I agree blocking all comments blocks free speech
__label__Evidence	three strikes allows someone to make a genuine mistake and not be punished as harshly right away.
__label__Evidence	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Evidence	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Evidence	setting a team aside to check for hate speech is the solution and removing it
__label__Evidence	I don't think this would a particularly helpful thing to do. Comment sections help readers make their contribution(s) to the discourse. Perhaps the development of algorithms that work through the comments to identify what's inappropriate and remove it.
__label__Evidence	IT is absoluety the websites job to police polirising comments if nesccearry to keep peace wihthin the outiside community viewing their newspapers.
__label__Evidence	The requirement of a phone number is a reasonable one, but might restrict participation (i.e. there will be people who are unable or unwilling to give their phone number just to comment on a newspaper website). An alternative approach could be to enforce a 'waiting time' from account creation to the ability to post comments? This would prevent repeat offenders from simply creating new accounts after they were banned
__label__Evidence	this will lead to fewer unwanted children and improve parental satisfaction
__label__Evidence	mandatory retirement is age discrimination and shouldn't be allowed to happen.
__label__Position	I don't believe that removing the comment section would reduce free speech at all. It's not removing your ability to talk about the article on a forum or with friends/family. I feel as though it's just removing it from an area where it is usually found in abundance. I can't begin to count how many times an articles comment section just turns into people spewing hate speech because they disagree with the content.
__label__Position	I think there must be a system that will detect hateful comments and block them.
__label__Position	We should ban cosmetic surgery for minors
__label__Position	Once again, I think this comes down to thorough monitoring and censoring of specific words. Additionally, having an option to report a comment would be beneficial so that attention is drawn to that comment and can be reviewed by a third party to see if it is appropriate. Perhaps if there were many issues and after a period of time it was being found that more harm than good was being shared in these sections, that they may have to be removed.
__label__Evidence	People are entitled to an opinion that isn't hateful or intended to harm a person.

__label__Evidence	These days, every man is considered as a potential rapist. If a woman makes a false molestation complaint against a man out of revenge or any other motive, society is more likely to believe the woman's words. Society and media exposes the accused before the investigation. This kind of attitude of society helps victims in genuine cases. But the scope of false cases is ignored. However the same is not true with the complaints against women. If the complaint is against a woman, people doubt about the genuinity of the case. What if the sexual harassment case against the man is a false case? Some people think like men can take anything. False molestation cases will result in the irreversible loss of reputation and causes mental agony to the accused and his family.

So people actually have to come to the EU and enter the EU if they want to ask for asylum in the EU. This has caused inhumane and dangerous circumstances as we see in the Mediterranean Sea.
__label__Position	Despite our general right to freedom of speech, hate speech remains inextricably linked to hate crimes and intolerance. A hard stance should be taken by newspapers against hate speech, utilising moderators to remove hateful comments, despite the fact that it could be construed as a restriction on free speech.
__label__Evidence	wider availability of student loans creates a glut of over-educated, under-employed individuals contributing less to society - money would be better investing in vocational education.

__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Evidence	factory farming has allowed the prices of food to drop drastically.
__label__Evidence	No, this is a horrible idea to force people to go vegan. While I agree that we, as a society, are eating too much meat, which is bad for both the environment and our health, this will only create tension and anger towards the EU.

__label__Evidence	How are we in jeopardy? The earth has made it this long, it will continue that way.
__label__Evidence	we need an educated workforce so the loan rate students take should be low and subsidised to get this workforce.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Evidence	this is an unnatural process that should be against the law.
__label__Evidence	state subsidy of journalism would threaten the independence and objectivity of any such reporting. what journalist is going to bite the hand that feeds them?
__label__Evidence	I agree that having at least one moderator present would reduce/eliminate hate speech. It could be done after comments are automatically submitted (delete the hateful comments after public viewing within a certain time frame) or, even better, they can only be posted after careful consideration by the moderator(s), permitting only positive comments.
__label__Position	There should be no option to log in without providing some form of ID so people posting harmful hate speech can be tracked and prosecuted.

__label__Evidence	Free speech is very important, but newspapers also has a responsibilty to ensure hate speech is not spread through their comment section.
__label__Evidence	austerity only suppresses the economy and makes the situation worse and for a longer period of time
__label__Evidence	There comments may be offensive to others.
__label__Position	Make sure that reports of hate speech are actually hateful and not just people being upset with no reason
__label__Evidence	The human rights-based approach should be the core principle. Legal channels for entry and fostering an integration policy based on respect for rights and equal treatment of both local and migrant workers, as key tools to address the social impact of migration flows are necessary.
__label__Evidence	For increasing the birthrate and supporting young families, Hungary should be an example. We should not rely on migration for this.
__label__Evidence	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Evidence	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.

__label__Position	We should recognize Esperanto as one of the cultural languages of EU citizens

__label__Evidence	firearms in the hands of civilians create societies more prone to violence
__label__Position	Hate speech is something is completely unacceptable and should be eradicated by all means necessary however regulations are our best bet if we are to maintain freedom of speech at the same time.
__label__Evidence	In a capitalist system in which all environmental and social and health costs of everybody affected would be internalized in the pricing of a product, the market could solve most problems.
__label__Evidence	private military companies provide violence - or threat of violence - for money, are poorly regulated and subject to endless accusation of corruption and bribery.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Evidence	Being open to the voice of the opposition means that we can hear another side of the argument
__label__Evidence	The pandemic has put European Intensive Care Units (ICUs) under extreme pressure. The most important lesson learned early on in the chaos of the pandemic was that equipment and medicines are necessary to save lives, but without adequately trained human resources, these elements are irrelevant. Ventilators don’t operate themselves. We saw patients in very critical condition being moved away from their families from one Member State to another to receive treatment while allowing the doctors to move would be much more efficient and less life-threatening for the patients.
__label__Evidence	this site has proven very popular and useful for those looking for information
__label__Evidence	Mass immigration is the biggest existential threat to the EU. The UNCHR has already 70 million registered refugees, mainly from Africa and the ME.

__label__Evidence	comments can be important to portray the views of the opposing 'side' of the narrative of the article
__label__Position	Comments are important as it can help create a balanced view and promote healthy discussion, maybe software could pick up on key words or phrases and then a moderator could look more in depth at questionable comments.

__label__Evidence	I like the idea of AI. but it still seems to fail a lot of the time: https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/04/1025742/ai-hate-speech-moderation/
__label__Evidence	British people are not better than anyone else and do not deserve special treatment from the EU. The British people will face the consequences of their decision to leave the EU and it is not the EU's responsibility to make Brexit painless. The benefits of membership cannot be bestowed upon citizens of countries outside the EU/EEA, like the UK.

__label__Evidence	the use of child actors exploits a child and can have negative effects on them
__label__Evidence	Across the EU, young people are continuing to face a number of significant challenges to enter and get a stable position in the labor market. They do not easily obtain good quality jobs with decent wages and are still faced with significant exclusion from regular employment, good-quality education, training opportunities as well as adequate inclusion and coverage in the national social protection systems. Young women and migrants are particularly affected. So we need a fairer migration policy but also consider migrant needs (and challenges) in other policy areas.
__label__Evidence	In societies where sex selection happens, men are favored over women, resulting in a lopsided sex ratio. This leads to many men being unable to wed.
__label__Evidence	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Evidence	the money spent on subsidizing space exploration could be better spent on other things that help all of society
__label__Evidence	to mess with nature could cause unforeseen consequences
__label__Evidence	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Evidence	embryonic stem cell research is playing god and is offensive to some religions.
__label__Evidence	good way to make a point
__label__Evidence	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Position	Research shows that letting comments proliferate with little oversight is a “dangerous recipe,” Andincivility and negative comments can have a long-term impact. Certain commenting software use algorithms meant to flag problematic comments, but machines can only do so much. Should newspapers really be spending already depleted resources on monitoring comments?
__label__Evidence	it is just another way for lazy people to do as little as possible.
__label__Evidence	people are so afraid of an imaginary punishment that they do not live their lives to the fullest - with atheism, it will be more convincing to live in the present.

Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Position	i agree that hate spech blocking does not really help in many ways. the root cause is the behavioral problem that needs a changed. i completely agree not to have comments section in many forums
__label__Evidence	if you kill or rape someone you deserve to die.
__label__Evidence	Whilst I agree that the platforms should be responsible, with the vast numbers of people contributing to some platforms it is virtually impossible to moderate every single comment.
__label__Evidence	people should be accountable for making bad decisions
__label__Position	It seems like many users think that having your personally details posted along with your comment would be a deterrent for people to comment hate speech
__label__Evidence	intellectual property rights serve to prevent the sharing of information and ideas, which would allow groundbreaking concepts to develop more quickly for the benefit of all.
__label__Evidence	private military companies protect assests and officials in war torn areas. they're needed. they don't take money from the tax payers to accomplish their missions and act only defensively.

__label__Evidence	This article summarises it well
__label__Evidence	private military companies are made up of soldiers that are probably much better trained than the kids we currently send to military.
__label__Evidence	when people mess with mother nature by trying to select the sex of their child, only bad things can happen.
__label__Evidence	private military companies are accessible to all, providing security and security measures that are currently not accessible to all.
__label__Position	The government needs to address this issue at its root instead of looking for a bandaid to put over the issue. That means prioritising social welfare and improving the education system because the main reason why there is so much hate speech is because of a lack of education and stress that prevents people from seeing clearly.
__label__Evidence	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Evidence	In variable pay schemes, the employees feel content and motivated with their work. They feel that they are an active part of the organization, the organization recognizes them as a part of its growth and values their efforts.

__label__Evidence	we should legalize organ trade because people would benefit by having a better life
__label__Evidence	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Evidence	True and in my opinion the right to freedom of speech should trump any counter argument.
__label__Evidence	these are usually located in universities. students need to prepare for the real world and know how to handle conflict. once they leave school they'll have no idea how to handle the constant conflict in life.
__label__Evidence	I tend to think that the government subsidizes too much already
__label__Position	Even if we all do not agree with each other (it would be a boring place if we did!) I don't think it is right to completely removing commenting on newspaper websites and articles. But there are people out there who will use those areas as an excuse and a place to spout their horrible opinions and hate speech. When they do this then detracts from the original article as people will start to call the person out so it becomes all about them. There may also be people reading those views who could be influenced by them which is why they need to be removed as quickly as possible.
__label__Evidence	gender neutral language is a way to go for a peaceful community
__label__Position	I think assertive responses in thee comment section can help with fairly reducing hate speech - allowing everyone the opportunity and right to have an opinion without attacking them and being open to ideas that you may not have considered, or may not personally align to you.
__label__Evidence	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Position	part of the issue is that heated debate cretes clicks - and newspapers love that esp the red tops. they live off incitement in the first place
__label__Evidence	they earn the wage they make for their job so why so they get extra?
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.

__label__Evidence	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Evidence	This would reduce hate speech and overall help to ensure a promote positive environment
__label__Position	it should target the insulting and violation to individual and groups right by law or common morality
__label__Evidence	Removing any form of comments or place for discussion may reduce hate speech, but also prevents discussion, leading to one sided arguments
__label__Evidence	I don't think we will ever fully get rid of hate speech on these platforms unfortunately however more close monitoring could decrease it, as well as sanctions for those who write the hate speech.
__label__Evidence	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Evidence	But hate speech hurts. We can't let it just run rife because it's "too hard" to address.
__label__Evidence	there is never going to be enough voluntary donation to meet demand, opening up an organ trade could remedy this drastic gap in supply to help save lives
__label__Evidence	economic sanctions provide security and ensure that citizens are treated fairly.
__label__Evidence	How do you propose to address the root causes?
__label__Evidence	supporting embryonic stem cell research is important because it is the future of medicine and it can help scientists to find new cures for diseases.

__label__Evidence	allowing children to pray and take some quiet time in school can be beneficial for their mental health.
__label__Evidence	mandatory retirement makes room in the workforce for younger more able bodied individuals to work.
__label__Evidence	What more is there to say? Online hate speech does breed violence, whether that of self-inflicyion or harm to others. And so yes, this extreme freedom of speech has to be curtailed. Many countries have already enforced strict monitoring of forums and news article comment sections to prevent disastrous outcomes.
__label__Evidence	If young Europeans are living abroad they will feel racism on their own in the country they are living in.
__label__Evidence	we should adopt a zero-tolerance policy to protect all of our children.

__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Evidence	it is not right that christians should force their message on poorer, more vulnerable people.
__label__Evidence	the government interferes in citizen's lives too much already
__label__Evidence	this would result in inaccurate representation in government. if there where numerous parties, votes would be split all over and the party people least wanted would win resulting in inaccurate representation.

__label__Evidence	Three strikes laws are expensive because they increase how long people are incarcerated which must be paid for by tax payers.
__label__Position	We should stop buying Russian gas
__label__Evidence	agree with this! Lack of education is often the biggest culprits when it comes to hate speech - many people are scared of things they don't know about.
__label__Position	I don't think removing the comment spaceis a good idea, people should still be given a platform where they can voice themselves out. Having a team look through the comments and find those that include hate speach and remove them and maybe ban the people whith hatespeach comments from ever posting comments again.
__label__Position	Creating algorithms to detect hate speech is not straight forward. There are a lot of types of detection systems/algorithms and each have their own pros and cons. An overview can be found here: https://vitalflux.com/hate-speech-detection-using-machine-learning/
__label__Evidence	More focus should go to mediate the effects than trying to reverse climate change

__label__Evidence	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	Again, a committee should be set to properly scrutinize the comments before they are uploaded.
__label__Evidence	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Position	The EU needs a single market for news
__label__Evidence	judges should be limited to upholding law rather than making it. that job is politicians.
__label__Evidence	Completely agree with this point. Address the root cause of the problem might be difficult but hate speech should be avoided at all costs.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Evidence	there is not need to subsidize wikipedia, it does not serve any purpose that cannot be filled elsewhere.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Position	Although technology could help reduce hate speech, there are issues. For example, the program has to be written by a human who themselves may have a bias which influences what amounts to hate speech or not. This is raised in this artcle: https://deepsense.ai/artificial-intelligence-hate-speech/
__label__Position	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.

__label__Evidence	pride parading is the peaceful place for lgbtq people to express themselves freely, demonstrate and require more acceptance from other people
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Evidence	we should subsidize wikipedia because everyone in the world knows it as a household name and if the government pays for libraries why cant they pay for wikipedia which contains probably more information.
__label__Evidence	mandatory retirement is necessarily, in many cases, to force someone out of a job that their age dictates they can no longer do appropriately.
__label__Evidence	this is good idea but some words can have more than one meaning and be used it variety of different sentences. so maybe muting words that could be discrimatory could have its limitations. i.e if you mut the word gay ( this word then count be used it postive topics about gay rights marriages etc .
__label__Evidence	It would stop hate speech the easiest way.
__label__Evidence	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Evidence	I agree
__label__Position	an informed overview about hate speech before anyone can comment so that they can know what to comment and not to comment
__label__Evidence	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Evidence	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Evidence	executives make enough and shouldn't be gaining any more when there are others who deserve bonuses

__label__Evidence	it should be the right of the individual whether to vote or not to vote.
__label__Evidence	Agreed people may be highly less likely to post negative comments if they had their true identity in display!
__label__Position	People who are signed up to online newspaper websites need to be warned that hate speech or continual hate speech comments can result in them being banned permanently from the news websites. People from the newspaper websites need to hire someone, if they haven't, to monitor and control which comments should be eliminated.
__label__Position	Social media manipulation through AI
__label__Evidence	judicial activism should be limited as judges should stick to their job and not try to grandstand on issues to gain popularity.
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Evidence	pride parades are a fantastic way for individuals to celebrate their identities which history has long put down as being not normal or labeled as a disorder.

__label__Position	We should have a CO2 Carbon Equivalent Indicator for every product in the market
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks.

__label__Evidence	we need to prohibit school prayer, as not all people agree with it and it should not be forced on anyone
__label__Position	I agree with so many of the comments above - there are some really good ideas. I think comment sections are needed in newspapers because it's a way to communicate and connect on different topics. There must be another way to reduce hate speech. Censoring words is a good idea. I also agree that it's now newspaper's sole responsibility to stop it so why should they have to remove the comment section.

__label__Evidence	People buy papers knowing the paper's political stance. I read articles to understand a journalist's perspective.

__label__Position	Recent political positions in the UK have lead to more fighting for 'free speech' and saying that it is ok to be offended - this is shown in a police news release (https://www.college.police.uk/article/protecting-freedom-expression-updated-guidance). I would disagree - offending people is unacceptable.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.

__label__Evidence	weapons are very tentative to commit a crime or create a vendetta against another person, that is why it is important to abolish the possession and carrying of arms.
__label__Position	As I saw some commentary on this platform, my opinion is that we need 2 things. A submission of personal data before one can have access to post anything related and real time moderation of the comments. Big platforms like YouTube, Instagram and others are held accountable for their users' actions and they have had a lot of success so far. Source: https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/combat-online-hate-speech/

__label__Evidence	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Position	Blocking words does not stop hate, what we need to do is have a filter that alerts a human so that a post. Posts/users should be identifiable to the platform they post on (not identifiable to the post but to the platform should any hate crime be identified)
__label__Evidence	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Evidence	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Evidence	That is not a bad idea that I think might work with proper moderation.
__label__Evidence	such a dramatic change to a language would have a hard time being universally adopted and would be difficult to enforce. he has already served as a gender neutral pronoun in the past.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

I am still for online filters and a competent team of mods, that can react to reported posts.

__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Evidence	libertarianism promotes political freedom of choice as its core value, and is the ultimate expression of democracy.
__label__Position	Social media contribute to reshaping “racist dynamics through their affordances, policies, algorithms and corporate decisions” (Matamoros-Fernández 2018, 933). I believe the social media contributes in hate speech thatis why people who are respectful expressing their opinions should be considered by signing the consent form. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230&ved=2ahUKEwjLpdz4mu_6AhUmgf0HHSRdCdMQFnoECAwQAQ&usg=AOvVaw29vPxYrjcDX7N5Cfya1-UQ
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Evidence	telemarketing is a pock mark on society. it disrupts peoples lives, causes extreme aggravation and pushes unwanted products and services on the poor, elderly and those prone to being taken advantage of.
__label__Position	Would require you to identify the hate speech so that people can learn that it is unacceptable and harmful to the readers of such comments. The keyboard warriors tend to abuse the freedom of speech. removing the the comment section would not be a good idea as we tend to be intriguid by the kind of feedback certain posts receive.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Evidence	I agree
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Evidence	European political parties should be independent of national parties. There should be primaries open for the citizens to choose the candidate, it would increase citizen participation and involvement in EU politics.
__label__Position	A discussion meeting to bring together key stakeholders and representatives from interested groups in Oxford could be an excellent way to start building a network and sharing knowledge and understanding. The Big Green Week at the end of September could be an opportunity to start this up! Start a list here of what you think key priorities and issues are!
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars strip drivers of the ability to drive as they please
__label__Evidence	we should adopt libertarianism because it cause less outside interference in your personal life
__label__Evidence	Tax revenues generated by cannabis could be redirected towards education in poor neighborhoods (increasing teachers' pay in these areas, reducing the number of teachers per class) in order to give these populations a better future. But unlike in the Netherlands, production should also be legal and highly regulated by the state.
__label__Evidence	people that come up with intellectual property should have the right to it and not have to share it with others if they don't want to
__label__Evidence	Libertarianism increases individual liberties by preventing the government from controlling every aspect of our lives.
__label__Evidence	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Evidence	we need to make it more accessible for the public to acquire education, as opposed to adding more barriers such as extreme student debt.
__label__Evidence	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Evidence	higher education is not an inherent right. if someone wants to go to college, they should pay for it. the burden shouldn't simply be put on taxpayers instead.
__label__Evidence	a lack of confidence due to appearance can have a crippling impact on poeple's lives and cosmetic surgery can help reduce this.
__label__Evidence	The right to free speech doesn't mean there should be no consequences for hate speech.
__label__Evidence	we should adopt athiesm because no religion will stop lots of wars and arguements.
__label__Evidence	we should abolish zoos to prevent the cruel confinement of wild animals
__label__Evidence	three-strike offenders are habitual criminals and should be treated as such
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Evidence	we need to continue to explore space as it is part of our world.
__label__Evidence	we should because times are changing and people are not sure of their gender anymore so it stops people being offended.
__label__Evidence	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Evidence	I agree and as stated in this article (https://www.impactplus.com/blog/no-comment-why-companies-continue-to-move-away-from-comment-sections-on-their-website) it is possible to see that some websites actually already deleted the comment sections. They turned out to be quite useless as mostly trolls were commenting, while no interesting discussions were there anymore.
__label__Position	Reducing it requires everyone is the comment section to be willing to educate people who feel expresssing hate speech is a freedom of speech. Working together as the world and the newspaper to elaborate if the confusion is beyond. Somethimes it happens because people dont understand whats actually happening.
__label__Evidence	school uniform is unaffordable for many single parents and should be abandoned.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	We need one single president of the Commission that will chair the Commission and the Council. I wonder though how the president of the EU Parliament would be involved in this structure.
__label__Evidence	legalizing organ trade would make it safer by moving it out of the hands of unscrupulous people operating in the black market.
__label__Evidence	child actors don't miss out on school as they often have a tutor on the set
__label__Evidence	space exploration provided scientific discoveries that were not thought of before
__label__Evidence	I totally agree we have freedom of expression
__label__Evidence	I do agree with education and raising awareness but what about bots and people who simply want to cause trouble?
__label__Evidence	Again, good point. Maybe there should be a daily limit on how many posts can be removed? (In order to avoid publishers becoming reliant on retrospective fixing, rather than their initial checks - which are where the problem originates).
__label__Evidence	The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us why robust public health and social care systems are so important for everyone, for rich and poor alike. Alongside other public services, they should be orientated towards the common good and not towards private gain. This makes them the backbone of fair and sustainable societies.
__label__Evidence	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Evidence	China is blocking India's bid to list Masood Azhar as a terrorist. Not just this, China is blocking India from becoming a member of Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) using its veto power. On one hand China wants to maintain good trade relations with India, and on the other hand, it is acting against India in many cases. So, maintaining good trade relations with China may not be a good thing.
__label__Evidence	we need more organs than people donate so legalizing it would be a good thing
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	cannabis should be legalized because it's just a plant and making a plant illegal is just weird.
__label__Evidence	if parents want their kids to pray at school so be it
__label__Evidence	Yes, any views shoudl be substantiated and when its obvious that it serves an agenda it should be deleted
__label__Evidence	In my opinion, yes, its normal to say what you are thinking as long as you dont harm anyone in any way sow yes silencing its needed.
__label__Evidence	I think the comment sections still need to be a respectful safe place to share your opinions. Free speech can be communicated in respectful way and still get your point/opinion across
__label__Evidence	they can monetize the paper
__label__Evidence	Criminals may take advantage of this.
__label__Evidence	Data localization is important for data sovereignty, which means the data of the citizens should be owned by the respective governments and not by other countries.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Evidence	Fighting for the abolition of nuclear weapons is useless - some of it is in the hands of very dangerous people in totalitarian countries which will not obey that demand
__label__Evidence	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.

__label__Position	Take a few minutes to breathe, meditate, and physically calm your body down before you start typing your response.
__label__Evidence	we all need to feel we have a refuge so it is critically important that we have safe spaces.
__label__Evidence	fast food is bad for children and is extremely poor quality
__label__Evidence	school uniforms place an unneeded financial burden on parents that are already paying large sums for private schools besides the fact that dress clothes are uncomfortable and add distraction to learning.
__label__Evidence	Prostitution is a legitimate choice, people should be free to do what they want with their bodies, criminalising it is a gross violation of the freedom of occupation.
__label__Evidence	Definitely polarised but can't imagine it ending well. You'll just turn it into a hate echo chamber.
__label__Evidence	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Evidence	I find the current actions of China to be incompatible with the ideology that the EU was formed and still has to this day, we can not have a relaxed attitude towards a country that sees all the world as competitors and enemies.
__label__Evidence	intellectual property rights should be protected, as intellectual property is the same as physical property.
__label__Position	There should be people assigned to go over the comments provided in order to ensure that the final approved posts do not contain hate speech. Basically a team set up to censor comments accordingly
__label__Evidence	It should be taught to children to make the world cleaner and safer for all animals.
__label__Evidence	whaling is not just cruel, but an indefensible assault on endangered species.
__label__Evidence	it is the right of the people to defend themselves, even with the use of deadly force.
__label__Evidence	Banning firecrackers in some places currently having pollution at its peak like Delhi-NCR will obviously bring down the poisonous emission of gases which has deadly effects on the entire balanced ecosystem. The highest level of particulate matter recorded in Delhi was 2.5 in the year 2016, which indeed made Delhi the most polluted city in the world in terms of air pollution. The “Central Pollution Control Board” also stated that the level of sulfur dioxide in the air gets tremendously high between 9 p.m. till midnight during Deepavali.
__label__Evidence	the ability to keep and use firearms is instrumental in a person's ability to persue safety, life and liberty
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Evidence	Free speech is a thing
__label__Position	It is not fair if newspapers take away the comment space. I do not consider this to be fair choice in a supposed democratic society/
__label__Evidence	Totally agree. It still gives space to express but will limit the hate speech
__label__Evidence	telemarkerting provides much needed jobs to people without other skill sets
__label__Evidence	we should oppose collectivism because it lessens creativity and individuality.
__label__Evidence	may help to maintain a self space
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars are dangerous, more dangerous than a single person could ever be. we're trusting a computer program to make life and death decisions.
__label__Evidence	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Position	Moderators approving posts before being public would be ideal, but expensive
__label__Evidence	cosmetic surgery is something that is life long. which is why minors, who's brains are not fully matured yet, don't have the ability to truly make such a decision for themselves.
__label__Evidence	legalizing the organ trade would encourage illegal ways of procuring organs for the profit
__label__Evidence	judicial activism allows lawful recourse in circumstances of possible justice miscarriages, and is an extra protection against possible corruption and obstructive 'influence' in the higher court.
__label__Evidence	Each country should keep its power, which is ensured through the current unanimous voting process in the European Union.
__label__Position	We should abolish zoos
__label__Evidence	people should be able to choose what they want to eat
__label__Evidence	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Evidence	it impairs your mind so it should be illegal
__label__Evidence	CEO's make 100 times what an average worker make and they do not actually generate any capital.
__label__Evidence	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Evidence	judges should not let their biases come into play when making judicial decisions; they should adhere to a strict interpretation of the constitution.
__label__Position	the comment section is for sharing information and opinions without the need of hate speech. those who promote and share hate speech should get banned from the comment section
__label__Evidence	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Evidence	prostitution is linked to many rapes, molestation and murders of young women.
__label__Evidence	This isnt a freedom of speech issue. That is only in relation to the govt not curtailing free speech. A private company... newspaper, has no obligation to allow you to freely air your views.
__label__Evidence	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Evidence	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Evidence	there is no diversity which might make people not want to read the newspaper
__label__Evidence	Legalization of prostitution will save millions of dollars in state resources that are currently spent cracking completely harmless small time prostitutes.
__label__Evidence	A way to deal with this could be starting laws against hate speech or have punishments in place.
__label__Evidence	judicial activism is the only way to maintain control
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Evidence	multi-party systems should not be allowed as it only causes a no win-win situation when the other parties can not agree upon a situation.
__label__Evidence	Such a hub could also have a bridging role between local necessities and opportunities at the EU level, such as project funding.
__label__Evidence	We should ban cosmetic surgery for minors because it sends a message to young people that conventional attractiveness is more important than health.
__label__Evidence	very often prostitutes are the most vulnerable in society and have drug and alcohol problems. they need to be properly protected.
__label__Evidence	Three strikes laws ruin young people's lives by preventing them from being accessing education and jobs that would pull them out of a life of crime by prolonging their time in jail during their formative years.
__label__Evidence	by ridding the world of nuclear weapons we do not have to worry about nuclear accidents or mistakes.
__label__Evidence	Breach of free speech
__label__Evidence	we should not legalize prostitution because they spread too many diseases
__label__Position	I think that comments at least need to be vetted so that when someone gives an opinion that is valid it can be posted but invalid, aggressive, nonsensical comments get filtered out.
__label__Evidence	human cloning should be banned because the ethical problems it creates are too difficult to overcome
__label__Evidence	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Evidence	Mandatory retirement should be in place for careers that require good physical health, younger ages and good flexibility such as law enforcement or any first responder career.
__label__Evidence	students loans should not be subsidized as it is a students choosing to continue to go to school on their own accord and whim, not a requirement to be the burden of others.
__label__Evidence	there is no need to ban fast food because there are some fairly healthy options to choose from. it's up to people to make smarter decisions about their food and their future health
__label__Evidence	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Evidence	We do have to adapt and evolve with the shifting climate. It's too late to halt the process entirely.
__label__Evidence	the olympic games are no longer a fair contest because many athletes use performance enhancing drugs
__label__Evidence	economic sanctions offer an effective way to deal with international conflict which does not involve military action.
__label__Evidence	we should not spend a fortune on the richest of the rich, it is unnecessary and elitist
__label__Evidence	In the past, every unknown thing dealt with religious beliefs. But now Science & Technology has taken over everything. We know the reasons for drought, earthquakes, windstorms, etc. they are scientific phenomena and not the wrath of gods anymore.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Evidence	human cloning could in the future be a big problem for humanity by creating a natural imbalance
__label__Evidence	we should not allow an austerity regime because it will completely destroy the country by causing worse economic demise.
__label__Evidence	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Evidence	legalizing cannabis will make it easier for those who need it for medical reasons to acquire it.
__label__Evidence	i don't think tax dollars should be going towards researching embryonic stem cells. there is much better usage for our money than that. we do not need to subsidize this.
__label__Evidence	collectivism is prejudiced and should not be acceptable
__label__Evidence	collapsing the comment section is not the solution because people have freedom of speech however those who make hateful comments can be flagged or banned from using the site
__label__Evidence	we should not cancel pride parades because they have the right to celebrate too.
__label__Evidence	We live in the XXI century. We do not want any repression of peripheries by their state center. Within the European Union, we should welcome the blessing of decentralism and localism, including the self-determination of stateless peoples and stronger autonomies within confederal agreements. If not in Europe, where? If not now, when?
__label__Evidence	we should not show preference to one website
__label__Evidence	It's not a good idea to pursue further enlargement. The greater the territory, the harder it is to control and keep problems from appearing. Every large empire in history fell because it grew to such size that it couldn't be properly managed and ruled over. Examples from history don't become suddenly invalid because we're living in the 21st century.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars are also one for the future since they operate itself they will encourage safe driving,parking,traffic.fuel efficiency will be adapted as well
__label__Evidence	the church of scientology promotes dangerous pseudoscience based on a science fiction book. it has no redeeming value, and should be banned.
__label__Position	i think minimum news coverage should be given to hate speech and it shouuld be very stictley monitered as well
__label__Position	We must remove that comment before publishing and printing out
__label__Evidence	we should cancel pride parades because they entice people who oppose that ideology to cause riots and disrupt the general peace of citizens.
__label__Evidence	factory farming is one way to ensure we have enough food for our citizen and it should not be banned.
__label__Evidence	a multi-party system would help create more options for voters.
__label__Evidence	safe spaces create an unrealistic environment that doesn't exist in the real world.

This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Position	Lack of resources to create a more elaborate filtering system is a factor that can impact the process
__label__Position	Another interesting argument is that there is a risk with platforms that alllow annonynimity online. For example as quoted here: https://www.csl.mtu.edu/cs6461/www/Reading/Davenport02.pdf and it can allow hate speech to go unmoderated.
__label__Evidence	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Evidence	certain words that are flagged as hate speech should be removed
__label__Position	We can only achieve by tremendous advances and investment in technology: clean energy production, CO2 capture in massive scale, hydrogen planes, ... , and much much more
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Evidence	Allowing the readers to push a post out of air by flagging it could be just as easily abused by people to mass flag posts they dont like for political or personal reasons and create more problems than it solves
__label__Evidence	We must protect our Planet, and without bees, wasps, or other arthropods, we go to our own extinction!
__label__Evidence	legalizing the organ trade would lead to people forcing or coercing other into giving their organs. this would increase death and suffering.
__label__Evidence	collectvism is unfair to the world and is irrational
__label__Evidence	This argument doesn't consider the ways in which certain kinds of speech can suppress other kinds of free speech. If hate speech is allowed to run rampant, this silences and threatens minority speech out of existence.
__label__Evidence	A European army is not a controversial idea, but a question of what integration of the armed forces of the member states means and what an army is in general. EU action on security and defense must extend to vigilance, openness, and transparency in economic, financial, fiscal, and social infrastructures. A European or joint - ideally worldwide - army is not a hierarchy, but an idea of common values, in the sense of human rights and strategic and coordinated action as well as socio-economic prosperity for all, without environmental pollution. But ordinances, decrees, etc. are a kind of 'silent mail' and can falsify the legal goals and values, as can reports and statistics.
__label__Evidence	The newspapers will not get to know how people realy feel about the issue at hand if the comment space is closed. The dialogue will be one sided
__label__Position	Asylum seekers should only be able to file asylum applications from their home or neighboring country.
__label__Evidence	compulsory voting would be beneficial because more people would take an interest in politics, creating a more fair representation in government.
__label__Evidence	the organ trade should not be legalized as it would invariably lead to targeting of the most vulnerable and least affluent of society.
__label__Position	The best way to curb hate speech would be to have the comments section moderated for any forms of hate speech. In this manner people who have an opinion with substance can have a say in whatever article that was published.
__label__Evidence	journalism should be subject to the same market forces as everything else
__label__Evidence	If any one state were to abolish nuclear weapons, it would immediately become vulnerable to another nuclear power, thus the government should not abolish nuclear weapons in order to fulfill its duty to protect its people.
__label__Evidence	we should, if it's subsidised it could mean better journalism
__label__Position	Yes, hate speech has become a pandemic and people are not aware of the damage it causes, removing or blocking such comments is not a solution and the perpetrator will use another platform. Rather let's educate one another and develop informative educational policy to eliminate the source rather than the symptoms. Education will liberate the mind and promote uniy and selfless.
__label__Position	the newspapers should have an algorithm that can detect comments which go against the community guidelines and ban these accounts. Spam accounts should also be detected and banned if they do no contribute constructively to the newspapers.
__label__Evidence	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Evidence	some people need a safe space to be safe from those out to hurt them and they should be available.
__label__Evidence	The EU and its member states have already various partnership or neighborhood programs for Non-EU states.
__label__Evidence	targeted killing is a barbaric practice.
__label__Evidence	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Evidence	people would not fight over religion if we just got rid of it.
__label__Evidence	student loans enable poor students to continue with their education and graduate from the university
__label__Evidence	we should ban it because of the often very high pressure sales tactics used to coerce a sale even if someone does not want to purchase anything

Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Evidence	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Evidence	safe places are good for students to be free from any conflicts
__label__Position	reducing hate speech on the newspaper websites is possible without taking the drastic measures of completely cancelling the comment section one way of doing that there should be moderators who approve the comment before they are published on the website.
__label__Evidence	You didn't discuss why they should not include a comments section. A comment sections allows the public to share their opinions on the subject matter and engage with one another pros and cons of the issue and see other points of view.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Evidence	we should not prohibit school prayer because this country was founded on christian principals.
__label__Position	In my opinion, completely removing the ability to comment is a win for the people using hate speech. The problem should be tackled in another way. Machine learning/AI/bots are getting better and more accurate each year, so using one of those to pre-screen comments and in addition using human moderators to decide the not so clear cases is far more optimal choice in my opinion, as it wont reduce the freedom of speech and opinion, as it should be in democratic world.
__label__Evidence	missionary work puts people into dangerous places where they can be harmed or killed.
__label__Evidence	if we end mandatory retirement many older workers that want to retire after many years of service may be denied that right
__label__Evidence	I totally agree with this idea, this would still allow for comments on newspaper websites while at the same time addressing the issue of online hate speech.
__label__Evidence	some tribes depend on whaling resources to survive.
__label__Evidence	we should allow scientists to continue to try to clone humans. just as medical treatments have progressed in the world who can predict what types of improvements in ending disease could occur.
__label__Evidence	there are many more practical realms of scientific inquiry that need our support more urgently.
__label__Evidence	more industrial accidents, more injuries, and truancy rates as a result of marijuana use will hurt businesses by causing loss of productivity
__label__Evidence	this is beautifully written, it should be a priority
__label__Evidence	targeted killing will prevent further havoc by the perpetrator
__label__Evidence	the number of fatalities that can be prevented with autonomous cars makes the development a moral imperative.
__label__Evidence	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Position	It will only take away a platform for people to post hate speech but it will still exist. perhaps keeping comments might allow open discussion which may impact other peoples thinking and reduce hate speech through debate and education
__label__Evidence	We have already English as a language of exchange.
__label__Evidence	PROFITS FROM A COMPANY SHOULD BE DIVIDED BETWEEN ALL WORKERS NOT JUST MANAGMENT
__label__Evidence	zoos are great educational tools, and it is also a safe place to take care of endangered species.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Evidence	that's right, comments actually can give a lot useful information but also give all the wrong idea about particular article.
__label__Evidence	human cloning should be banned because it interferes with nature
__label__Evidence	this can also be dealt with by having moderators who can filter fake news out/highlight the correct facts and refer to more up to date stories if relevant
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	an austerity regime is the most effective weapon in our arsenal to combat the economic issues we're facing
__label__Evidence	the use of autonomous cars should result in a substantial reduction in road traffic accidents which currently are largely a result of human error.
__label__Evidence	we should not subsidize journalism as they are private companies and can raise tons of money without our fear of bad reporting because their company would tank if they reported bad news.
__label__Evidence	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Evidence	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Evidence	We should all think before we comment freedom of speech does come with responsibilities
__label__Evidence	it is essential that people realize the whole world is diverse. by promoting these parades we are showing the world that you need to be proud of who you are regardless or gender or orientation.
__label__Evidence	The EU should do it in an impartial manner and act against all countries regardless of political ideology. The EU should stand out to help all minorities and not just the politically advantageous ones. The oppression of Catalonians and Hungarian minorities outside its border is a constant problem since WW2 and it is completely ignored. If the EU wants to convince the masses, then it can't just cherrypick issues.
__label__Evidence	it is important that the highly experienced, well trained people at the top of the judicial system can use their own experiences and common sense when passing judgments - else anyone could be a judge.
__label__Evidence	prayer in school is not harming anyone or their rights so i do not think it should be prohibited.
__label__Evidence	we should legalize sex selection because the parents are free to decide what gender they want

__label__Evidence	this would provide more choices and let us see more points of view
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Evidence	some women have no other way to support themselves and their children
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading is unfair because traders with faster computers and better connections to the market will have an advantage over others.
__label__Evidence	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Evidence	targeted killing may be necessary in very limited circumstances where there is an immediate threat to life of civilians or military personnel
__label__Evidence	Expansion by many dissimilar members and in particular the implementation of the EURO has made the EU unmanageable. The EURO is too strong for the less competitive members and is therefore unsustainable.
__label__Evidence	Punishments would be good but also a mixture of education and this could help. Hate speech is a very person-by-person thing, what some may think isn't, some may think is.
__label__Position	Technology should be used to detect and remove hate speech. An example of how well this has worked is Facebook (https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/hate-speech-prevalence-dropped-facebook/) which said hate speech has dropped by almost 50% with their algorithms.
__label__Evidence	I don’t think completely removing the comment space would solve the issue. A similar example would be Youtube removing the dislikes count on videos, it makes t he information less objective.
__label__Position	Removing the comments section can eliminate hate speech but also eliminates the ability for other readers to have a healthy discussion about the topic and add their own opinions and views. I think using a moderator or AI to moderate content could be a good way of eliminating hate speech. Or have a report button so that other readers can report such comments.
__label__Position	If the truth is exposed and there is transparency.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Evidence	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Evidence	how do we mute these comments? Cencorship?
__label__Evidence	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Evidence	people will be deterred to rely on information on newspapers if there are no guidelines regulating hate speech
__label__Evidence	people have the right to freedom of religion, even scientology and this right should not be infringed upon.
__label__Evidence	The level at which data can be tracked/who this data gets given to could cause repercussions of privacy especially with things like GDPR
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Evidence	It is time, to be honest about this! Europeans have the right to self-determination like every other country out there! This is OUR home and a home for everyone is a home for no one.
__label__Evidence	an organ trade could lead to exploitation of vulnerable people for financial gain.
__label__Evidence	we should limit judicial activism so that we do not depart from the constitution.
__label__Evidence	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	We should end illegal pushbacks!
__label__Evidence	A few people now have social anxiety due to not having enough face-to-face interactions. When we avoid talking to people for a long time, automatically we develop a fear to involve in small talk.
__label__Evidence	If driverless cars are allowed in India, they can be used for a variety of other purposes also such as delivery or pickup service, which will also save time and human resources.
__label__Evidence	libertarians adopt the best policies, regardless of which party espouses them.
__label__Evidence	The European Parliament has developed avenues for a common foreign and defense policy and should exercise its role this way. Also, there are prerogatives of a parliament to guide and control the external policies of the EU.

__label__Evidence	Yes, and moderators ensure that comments stick to this
__label__Evidence	it is everyone's national duty to at least vote in elections
__label__Evidence	Nuclear weapons are so powerful, they discourage conflict.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Position	There should be an EU citizenship
__label__Evidence	internet is not a devil, people are
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Position	it can be done
__label__Evidence	we definitely should, this research can make significant breakthroughs for musical science
__label__Evidence	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Evidence	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Evidence	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Evidence	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Evidence	How is this going to stop trolls that create multiple accounts so that if they are blocked they just do it from another faceless account consequences.l
__label__Evidence	private military companies might be engaged in times of conflict when regular national military service is not eunough
__label__Evidence	I do agree partially, that removing the comment section is not the solution. But rather have no comment section than an unregaluted one full of hate speech.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Evidence	we should not abolish the right to keep and bear arms because people have a right to defend themselves if someone has the intention of harming you or breaking into your house.
__label__Evidence	if a company created something, we shouldn't just let everybody else copy them
__label__Evidence	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Evidence	fast food is bad for our health and we really should ban any of it
__label__Position	I agree with this and think more education is needed.
__label__Evidence	It's important not to confuse freedom of speech and hate speech: "freedom" can be a dangerous weapon when you use it to attack others for their identity.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Evidence	the use of weapons of mass destruction can not be justified
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Evidence	This will allow online users to think twice before spewing hate speech
__label__Evidence	Moderators who follow specific guidelines so that they are all consistent would be the best option to eleiminate bias
__label__Evidence	school uniform stops students from being bullied for their clothing
__label__Evidence	there is an increase in anti-social behaviour and lack of respect among schoolchildren these days so a zero-tolerance policy will quickly teach them to respect the rule and people in general
__label__Evidence	families should have the right to choose the sex of their babies.
__label__Position	There should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.
__label__Evidence	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Evidence	as there are many genders out there today, not using gender-neutral language excludes far more people than in the past.
__label__Evidence	Algorithmic trading will put many stock brokers and analysts out of business.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars are the future and some cities already have them.
__label__Position	Newspapers should be neutral when reporting, however, nowadays that isnt the case and I feel they are the ones that actually instigate hate speech - negativity sells and if they can get as much reaction they will go to any lenghts to do so. In order to fairly reduce the hate speech from readers comments it has to be heavily moderated, personal details required in order to make a comment and possibly have a word block or something where the comment is replaced with "this goes against our hate speech p olicy"
__label__Evidence	all criticism cannot be considered hate crime, sometimes it can be the harsh truth. How can we make sure these comments don't get deleted too.
__label__Evidence	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Evidence	I believe the EU should expedite the enlargement process towards the Western Balkans, to help them evolve and facilitate the reconciliation problems. As you say, Montenegro for instance is a peaceful country that has made efforts to overcome past troubles, and that too should be acknowledged.
__label__Evidence	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	Another option would be for newspapers to introduce a "report" button so that readers can report hate speech. These comments can then be reviewed by the newspaper's in house "hate speech control" team.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Evidence	This will relieve the European prison system. This would encourage many migrants to take responsibility for the laws of the host countries.
__label__Evidence	Greenhouse gases were drastically higher when the dinosaurs walked, and earth survived just fine. Climate change can always be reversed, the question is simply how much effort over what period of time.
__label__Evidence	zero tolerance sets a clear and specific guideline for all to adhere to
__label__Position	Moderation should be taken perhaps slightly more seriously - and for websites like Metro and MailOnline this is done so through active moderation rather than technological triggers. This link: https://committees.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/25756/html/ shows a pretty coherent list of moderating activity for the DMG group and it is promising to see that particular stories (often of a sensitive nature or relating to criminal cases) are not open to receive comments on public forums. It is often forgotten that news outlets' primary intention is to inform - it is only in recent decades that the element of discourse has been implemented (at least easily and openly, outside of writing into a newspaper to voice an opinion).
__label__Evidence	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Evidence	many people use religion to connect with their family as well as loved ones that are no longer alive - losing this comforting connection would be devastating for some.
__label__Evidence	the cars can be dangerous and cause accidents if the equipment fails.
__label__Evidence	more parties will create a more convoluted political system
__label__Evidence	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	1st argument: allowing hate speech to fester online is detrimental and can be hurtful to others. It can have horrific consequences. By moderating and removing hate speech comments, this should prevent any negative consequences from occurring.
__label__Position	E-voting brings more harm than good
__label__Evidence	legalizing marijuana leads to more marijuana-related medical emergencies cases and unintentional cannabis overdose injuries among children
__label__Evidence	an austerity regime would cut down on social welfare and hurt those most in need.
__label__Evidence	student loans take many years to pay off and if we don't subsidize there will be less students willing to go to college.
__label__Evidence	The right to keep and bear arms should be abolished because when writing the Second Amendment the founding fathers couldn't have forseen the development of such destructive modern day weaponry.
__label__Evidence	Nuclear weapons should be abolished because they have to potential to cause so much destruction.
__label__Evidence	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Evidence	Moonlighting can help in upskilling. A few people want to learn new skills apart from what they are working on in their primary job. This can help them in developing expertise in their field. Some might get bored with monotonous jobs and hence take up second jobs to learn new skills and thereby make their days exciting.
__label__Evidence	non-gasoline cars improve local air quality on city streets.
__label__Evidence	everyone should have the right to keep and bear arms for protection
__label__Position	This isnt a freedom of speech issue. That only related to public, not private entities. A private company can prevent you from voicing your opinion on their platform for any reason. i think hate speech is probably the best reason a private company can give in this respect. https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/about-educational-outreach/activity-resources/what-does
__label__Evidence	we will not hear other peoples opinion, so this is not a good idea
__label__Position	We should put the accent on traditional values and on preserving family life
__label__Evidence	This allows for people to understand that something will be done if they conduct hate speech.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Evidence	an austerity regime will cause taxpayers to have to pay more taxes
__label__Position	My views on this have not changed. A moderated comments section with a flagging system is still a good way of allowing discussion while limiting hate speech.
__label__Evidence	There should already be policies that hinder hate speech as it seems that the problem is escalating
__label__Evidence	everyone should have a choice about what they want to do with their bodies, and if selling an organ is one of them, they should be free to decide.
__label__Evidence	libertarianism is a form of selfishness which promotes the rights of the individual over the rights of everyone.
__label__Evidence	cosmetic surgery helps build self esteem
__label__Evidence	Some people are already focusing on fitness. We can observe this with the increasing number of fitness startups. But that is a small proportion of people. Generally, many people want to maintain an active lifestyle, but all they need is some encouragement. So, this movement constantly reminds people to focus on fitness goals just like Swachh Bharat reminds us of the importance of keeping our surroundings clean.
__label__Position	I think there should be a limit where this "hate speech" is only about the work that is done in order to be criticized. Otherwise it becomes very hard to distinguish whether a criticism is about the work or is it personal attack.
__label__Evidence	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Evidence	if organ trade was legal it would be easier for people to get the organs that they need.
__label__Evidence	a zero-tolerance policy gives no leeway for administrators in cases where the crime may not be so serious.
__label__Evidence	wikipedia has been supported by voluntary donations for too long. subsidizing it would give it more credibility, and would allow the volunteers to continue to update it with the most accurate information.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	a multi party system would bring many new & fresh ideas into the forefront
__label__Evidence	This is a good argument, instead of trying to stop free speech altogether rather look to filter out specifically hate speech.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Evidence	prayer in schools violates a person's right to follow whatever religion they choose.
__label__Position	This is not just a newspaper comment section problem... it's a social media problem as well, more like an internet problem. We need way to not push people away, but educate them. Because the truth is, nobody starts out as a hater but radicaliz ation can happen to anyone. check https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P55t6eryY3g
__label__Evidence	cosmetic surgery, other than for disfigurments, should be banned. society puts too much pressure on people to look perfect. people should embrace individuality.
__label__Position	Food health and industry companies should be located within the EU
__label__Evidence	cannabis is a gateway drug that can lead people to try harder drugs, so it should remain illegal.
__label__Evidence	Filmmakers spend lot of money and time to make movies. If parts of the movie is cut in the name of censorship, they will be discouraged to make more movies.
__label__Evidence	We should not ban telemarketing as it it allows people to learn about new products or services from the comfort of their own homes.
__label__Evidence	private military companies could be a danger to our national security because their motives are financial in nature which means they could act in ways that are not in our country's best interest politcally.
__label__Position	I think consistent and thorough moderation is the way forward with this. Any public forum requires a delicate balance of free speech and regulation though this seems to lean to the former at the moment - any Daily Mail article is evidence of this in particular. I do agree with a number of comments here, in that keeping commenting open allows for healthy discussion and learning opportunities, however, it is often the case that many comments left (particularly on sensitive or divisive topics) are irrelevant and are outright bullying.
__label__Evidence	the school uniform gives no individuality to students
__label__Evidence	we should ban fast food because all of the chemicals it is made with is unhealthy and makes you obese
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Evidence	I agree with you, i feel like thats what media is about, expressing ourselves.
__label__Evidence	we should adopt libertarianism because it helps many people
__label__Evidence	Only allowing paying users might result in the most of the users in a comment section having the same view. For example, many young people do not use newspaper websites. Each comment section might not be diverse at all in type of users or the opinions being shared. Is an echo chamber better, equal to, or worse than a few hate comments?
__label__Position	FILTER
__label__Evidence	we should ban targeted killing because innocent people can get aught in the crossfire.
__label__Evidence	strongly agree with andreas
__label__Evidence	Intellectual property rights keep people from stealing others' ideas and selling them as their own.
__label__Position	Agreeing with others here: a standard of moderation would have to be communicated to the user, with straightforward policies of flagging or reporting potentially hateful comments. A synthesis of live and algorithmic moderators might be best, as certain words can be auto-flagged for review, whereas other things might involve a more delicate touch.
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Evidence	I think it is a good idea to be able to flag the comment so moderators can review it
__label__Evidence	capital punishment might be the only way to fairly punish a criminal for an exceedingly awful crime.
__label__Evidence	algirithmic trading reduces the possibilty of error and just furthers profit for finance companies
__label__Position	There should be a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism
__label__Evidence	austerity regimes are too restrictive, too many cuts and would not benefit the citizens of the united states.
__label__Evidence	the school uniform creates routine and discipline in the students. the use of the school uniform teaches students respect and to follow and comply with the rules
__label__Evidence	Restricts free speech
__label__Evidence	cosmetic surgery is a form of self expression and it is unfair to prevent a consenting individual from partaking.
__label__Evidence	A team of moderators would have their own bias so it is not possible to know what is really hate speech.
__label__Evidence	we should not ban algorithmic trading because computers are smarter than people
__label__Evidence	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Position	Not possible to to it completely, hate spech can be quite subtle. Needs real time moderation.
__label__Evidence	It's true that hate speech is discriminatory and can constitute violence, but not all comments on news platforms are hate speech, and some are constructive. People should be allowed to share their authentic views on a subject, as long as those views do not discriminate against specific groups of people.
__label__Evidence	we should ban whaling because they are becoming closer to being extinct. no animal should be killed when there is not an abundance of their species.
__label__Evidence	the right to bear arms is enshrined in the second amendment and must not be violated
__label__Evidence	the only ones that suffer with economic sanctions are the regular citizens of the countries.
__label__Evidence	I do not agree with this, to solve this issue, there should be moderators to monitor the comments before they are posted
__label__Evidence	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Evidence	they are boring and cost too much money
__label__Evidence	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of self publicity. If the community isolates the perpetrators by flagging negative content that would be helpful. Flagged content would then need to be followed by banning perpetrators
__label__Position	thats a good idea
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't have to adopt a gender neutral language, i think people should just understand that people speak languages in different ways and they should be acceptable of that.
__label__Evidence	economic sanctions are unethical to the economies of smaller, underdeveloped countries.
__label__Evidence	I agree with this point of view - a lot of the times I hear people railing against the censorship of hatespeech it is because they aren't aware of the damage they are causing or have been caught out saying something they didn't think was bad to begin with
__label__Evidence	The true purposes of telemarketing are to pressure feeble-minded people into buying things they don't really want, and to make it easier to get away with fraud
__label__Evidence	All we can do is reduce our impact but not reverse it.Unfortunately is statistically inevitable
__label__Evidence	legalizing prostitution would spread many diseases.
__label__Evidence	it is not always possible to monitor every single post
__label__Evidence	whaling should be banned because it harms economic activity that's generated by whale watching
__label__Position	comments should be moderated but we cannot remove all the negative and leave the positive comments. it would look like the newspaper is being biased
__label__Evidence	Factory farming is unethical and produces meat that is not healthy for anyone to eat.
__label__Evidence	We should adopt libertarianism because individuals know their own best interests better than any third party.
__label__Position	create an algorithm that identifies hate speech and removes it
__label__Evidence	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Evidence	ip rights enable large corporations to have a stranglehold over creators designs and work and should be abolished
__label__Evidence	This should be part of every single citizen mendality in this planet. Assuming that this is a problem of someone else, then we will lose the fight before it even starts!
__label__Evidence	capital punishment is a deterrent for others to commit the same crimes.
__label__Evidence	i guess you could pretend that everything is great
__label__Evidence	we should not adopt libertarianism because left on their own many people would make a choice that adversely effects their lives without weighing all the consequences.
__label__Evidence	zero tolerance policies don't allow for adminstrators to use their judgement to administer punishment
__label__Evidence	Whenever you find yourself in crisis, and the EU is in crisis, it is a good idea to return to core business. And in the case of the EU, the core business is economy, trade, and security. That's where the focus should be.
__label__Evidence	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Evidence	libertarians are more fair than other politicians.
__label__Position	How about removing the anonymity part of it like everyone who wants to comment must be a verified member.
__label__Evidence	They promote cosmetic surgeries. Women these days, are ready to spend thousands of dollars on getting hair extensions, fake teeth, botox injections, body implants, spray tans, branded outfits and makeup products. This could be extremely expensive to afford and such expenses are never-ending. Cindy Jackson, a known television star. has a world record of 52 plastic surgeries done by her. Some women can even get addicted to such practices and then theirs no look back. This is the direct influence of society's importance to beauty.
__label__Position	Removing hate speech from comment section should be a must as there should not be any room for hate speech in our society. My original thought was that commenters should not be allowed to remain anonymous and that any hate speech by them should have real life consequences. Having had this original thought I am now inclined to say that commenters should be allowed to remain anonymous an example behind my thoughts are that in some countries it is illegal to be gay and those who are, are persecuted. If for example they wanted to post on an article or give an opinion on an LGBTQ issue then they could be identified. There are more reason to remain anonymous, found here https://www.techiexpert.com/reasons-why-people-seek-anonymity-on-the-internet/
__label__Position	A combination of computerise moderation (to filter out offensive words) and human moderators can reduce such hate speech.
__label__Evidence	As people age they tend to commit less crimes, keeping individuals in jail for life only because of three-strikes laws is a waste of money and doesn't protect society.
__label__Evidence	we have a tremendous amount of highly intelligent /students who could not go to college without subsidizes. these students could find cures to fatal illnesses and should be subsidized to benefit all of society.
__label__Evidence	cosmetic surgery helps people feel better about their appearance, which can help them create positive changes in other areas of their life.
__label__Evidence	they can be more dangerous than human drivers
__label__Evidence	cosmetic surgery is a way of masking what may be deeper rooted psychological problems
__label__Evidence	judicial activism is necessary to determine outcomes of cases that are not black and white.
__label__Evidence	a multi-party system weakens speed of decision making and ensures no progress is made so we should not adopt it.
__label__Evidence	the three-strikes law is unfair to those criminals who are trying to reform themselves.
__label__Position	I have heard that the Chile/Madrid Climate Change Conference Closes with Limited Ambition
__label__Evidence	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	We should introduce compulsory voting
__label__Evidence	i agree there has to be a balance, and freedom of speech is important for society.. but there has to be limits as to hate speech, and discrimination.
__label__Evidence	Discrimination may divide readers
__label__Evidence	"Tradtional skills training as part of a building conservation project has shown to be a successful approach" (Peter Cox)
__label__Position	Retirement homes should become more common
__label__Evidence	Agree, it is essential to monitor hate
__label__Evidence	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Evidence	Abolishing the veto right in the current EU foreign policy voting procedure will only serve larger nations in the union and small member states would lose all their power and slowly turn into puppets of the larger nations instead of equal partners
__label__Evidence	we should abolish the olympic games because it is inhumane to have people compete for profit or gain.
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Evidence	embryonic stem cells are superior to stem cells derived elsewhere because they can potentially grow into any type of cell -- subsidizing this research would allow for scientific research to advance faster.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Evidence	minorities are more likely to be prosecuted and therefore have prior offences so this is unfairly applied
__label__Evidence	capital punishment does not allow for people convicted wrongly, for whatever reason, and a posthumous innocence verdict does not make it any less inhumane
__label__Position	Having a heavy hand in removing hate speech could backfire and reinforce certain readers' skewed worldviews. A study published on Science Direct (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304422X19301159) says that censorship of online comments can confirm commenters' conspiratorial views. Hate speech can lead to real life violence, but you have to go about moderation carefully.
__label__Evidence	Human spoiled the nature to a great extent and they have to face the consequences and should avoid doing more harm to the environment any further.
__label__Evidence	whaling is inhumane and unnecessary and killing the whale population.
__label__Evidence	adopting gender neutral language would make it easier to be inclusive.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Evidence	subsidizing journalism will create biased reporting
__label__Evidence	introducing a multi-party system would be detrimental to stability and consistency of our political system
__label__Position	I notice that there is a contrast between education and punishment towards offenders. For example, BenedictN believes that punishment is the best way to deal with hate speech. However, AllisonK and LawrenceM believe that education is the best way to deal with hate speech. I propose that all users should be educated on creating a respectful and inclusive discussion before commenting, but if hate speech is detected, punitive measures should include further educational measures that encourage discussing respectfully instead of avoiding discussion.
__label__Evidence	the olympic games has become less about the sports and more about commercialism
__label__Evidence	his is the issue in politics and public sector policy making. No objectives are to be pursued. No problems to be solved. I guess it is the nature of the beast. Balancing conflicting interests.
__label__Evidence	But comments should be sorted to prevent hate speech
__label__Evidence	they can cause accidents if the equipment fails.
__label__Evidence	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Evidence	it is a thin line to censorship
__label__Position	This article describes how censoring might lead users to leave platforms and join other platforms with lighter censoring rules https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/global-extremes/does-censoring-radical-right-social-media-work/
__label__Evidence	forcing people to vote will cause an unwanted outcome in elections. having no vote is as much speech as voting.
__label__Position	I think that automatic tools like filters are a good idea but too prone to error. Harmless words might accidentally be filtered out and those using hate speech are usually wise to this and learn how to manipulate their words or spelling to bypass filters. A moderation policy implemented by a human moderator still seems like the best response to me.
__label__Evidence	subsidizing student loans will enable many more people the opportunity to attend college
__label__Position	The Internet should be censored
__label__Position	Censorship of movies is an outdated concept
__label__Evidence	Esperanto is linguistically neutral: The language was created with the principle of internationality in a European context. It’s democratic: There are no native speakers of Esperanto, or better yet not any monolingual speakers of Esperanto. Everyone has to learn it as a second language. As a result of this nobody will have an advantage over others and nobody can feel like a 'stranger' since nobody can feel like a 'native'. Everyone is respected regardless of their origin and not discouraged from learning the language.
__label__Evidence	the olympic games allow for a show of strength among a country's athletes in a sportsman like manner, allowing for global participation and unification.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Evidence	I like the balanced approach suggested.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	Even though damage is done, there are ways to counter the damage through other actions. If enough of these are done, they can cumulatively overpower the irreversible actions and thus reduce climate change as a net overall.
__label__Evidence	wikipedia should be financed different ways

__label__Evidence	there is never a justifiable reason to kill someone.
__label__Evidence	yes. if their going to make money from individuals, they should also suffer the consequence of creating a safe space for them.
__label__Evidence	No more non-European immigration. The native Europeans have said NO.
__label__Position	comment sections are necessary so we can see different opinions on one topic
__label__Evidence	to legalize cannabis would be to tell people that it is safe to use, which is untrue, which would result in many more using it and an epidemic in psychological problems
__label__Evidence	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Evidence	I also agree with this position. letting people fully express themselves will fully enable sourcing The root of the problem
__label__Evidence	I agree
__label__Evidence	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Evidence	young workers won't be able to find a job if no one ever retires
__label__Evidence	it send the wrong message to society that drug use is acceptable
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	i think one of the best ways is to allow everyone a free space of commenting yet making sure that all the hate speech is automatically blocked no one can see those comments except the administrator
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	three is an arbitrary number and may not be appropriate in some instances or for some crimes
__label__Evidence	the right to keep and bear arms was designed in an era of muskets and bows. these weapons today are much more machine like and ought not be allowed in society.
__label__Evidence	We all want to see transparent, democratic, and value-based policy-making. The right to good administration is embedded in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and should guide the EU's actions.
__label__Evidence	That's a terrible idea. The government propaganda machine is already going at full steam. Do you have any idea what the psychological impact of these kinds of messages is when you blast them at people all day every day for over a year? Depression, suicides, and domestic violence are all the consequences of living in a hopeless and high-stress environment for a protracted period of time and are at record levels throughout Europe. In this entire covid crisis the so-called 'health experts' have consequently ignored the fact that your mental state has a direct influence on your health. i.e.: If you're stressed out, you're more likely to get sick. Instead, they have willfully created panic. Just like your ad would.
__label__Evidence	fast food contributed to the obesity problem in the us
__label__Evidence	The unanimous vote is the cause of European stagnation. Foreign and security policy requires speed. Unanimity should be replaced with a qualified majority.
__label__Position	We should promote awareness in society of what migrants are contributing.
__label__Evidence	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Evidence	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Position	Best would be to use filters for keywords and have a functional helpdesk, team of mods,... If the mods ARE effective and the climate between the users is friendly, there is a high chance, that not many trolls/toxic comments will come up at a later time.
__label__Evidence	flagging comments would be an easier way
__label__Position	i think a law should be made that if you do not delete hate speech from your website or article than that newspaper will have to pay a fine.
__label__Evidence	space exploration is an expensive vanity project and subsidization could be abused by military and private interests.
__label__Position	Climate neutrality can be achieved only by nuclear energy
__label__Evidence	Agree. it also highlights the need for work to be done on hate speech/racism. Just because the comments section isn't there, doesn't mean hate speech doesn't exist.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Position	A reporting site that is accessible across all platforms would be a good start like https://www.report-it.org.uk/reporting_internet_hate_crime.
__label__Evidence	Synchronizing national elections would allow European citizens to engage in major pan-European campaigns.
__label__Evidence	we should abolish safe spaces as policing these areas is costly and it is against human rights to stop freedom of movement into different areas.
__label__Evidence	cosmetic surgery creates an unhealthy body image in media for children to try and conform to.
__label__Evidence	In order to strengthen democracy in the EU, Council meetings should be open to the public and the press. Only in open Council meetings are the Ministers of the Member States forced to clearly state the national interests they can vouch for in relation to their national partners and Voters. Together with the European Parliament, it focuses on an open political debate and decision-making process.
__label__Evidence	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Position	Require all comments to go through a censor first. can limit hate speech. https://www.netreputation.com/internet-censorship-pros-cons/
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Position	We should strengthen Frontex and control immigration
__label__Evidence	cannabis is seen as a gateway to other more harmful drugs and shown to have harmful effects to mental health and should, therefore, be banned.

__label__Evidence	judicial activism undermines the rule of law
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't oppose collectivism because sometimes you have to look out for what is best for society as a whole and not how it would benefit a specific individual.
__label__Evidence	The comments need to hidden from the public comments and get approved to be viewed in online newspaper website.
__label__Evidence	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Evidence	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Evidence	a multiparty system blurs the citizenship of a vision and model of country. we should not adopt a multiparty system because it would waste valuable time to agree
__label__Evidence	we need school uniforms to make sure that students come to school in proper attire and to give them a sense of unity with other students.
__label__Evidence	telemarketing has reached epidemic levels with unregulated frequency that most people would consider a public nuisance.
__label__Evidence	While I agree that hate speech is such, I feel like getting rid of the comment section would really go backwards and do more harm than good.
__label__Evidence	telemarketing is intrusive and violates the right to private property
__label__Evidence	It is definitely the way to go. We should not allow hate speech
__label__Evidence	Such a platform if it provides youngsters with free or at least affordable mental-health assistance, will help them finally able to overcome our society’s barriers to taking care of our mental health and emotional well-being.
__label__Evidence	The EU leadership fails to carry out its fundamental duties: guard its border and protect its own people. Even 30 years after Schengen was introduced.
__label__Position	Europe is getting older and should be open to more migration from Asia, and southeast Asia.
__label__Evidence	Executives earned the right to make that much due to training, schooling and fighting their way to the top.
__label__Evidence	compulsory voting shouldn't be introduce because it forces undecided people to vote for a random people will ruin the quality of elections

__label__Evidence	we should adopt atheism because we can not prove that deities really do exist.
__label__Evidence	legalising prostitution may promote the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
__label__Evidence	We should not abolish the three-strikes laws, because crime has fallen since they were introduced.
__label__Evidence	telemarketing intrudes on the personal lives of people through unwanted calls and unsolicited mail, therefore it should be banned.
__label__Evidence	wikipedia shoud be independent and with subsidization this may be at risk depending on the subsidization source
__label__Evidence	stop the development of autonomous cars because it can cause accidents due to the laws in different countries being different
__label__Position	I think that newspaper websites should not disable the comment section they should monitor it and remove anyone spreading hate or conspiracy theories regardless of this whole freedom of speech thing newspapers should have the power to ban anyone spreading bogus news,
__label__Evidence	we should abolish the right to keep and bear arms. that law was established before guns became deadly machines.
__label__Evidence	intellectual property rights shouldn't be abolished because it helps to ensure the originator is reimbursed accurately for their ideas.
__label__Position	AI technology could be used to override the possible bias that there might be if the moderators are human. It would follow an unbiased algorithm. https://www.smartmoderation.com/how-to-give-your-readers-the-comment-sections-they-want
__label__Evidence	quite an optimistic way to see it
__label__Position	Our freedom to do anything as part of a society is limited. Thus freedom of speech should be no different. Poeple need to be held accountable for their mistakes, so everybody else's rights will be protected. So having a set of keywords which are not allowed to be used is a way of reminding the writter that using the offensive word he/she is trying to use is considered a crime. An additional way to handle that is having the flag option by users and a team of moderators who follow a standard and will verify if flagged comments should be maintained or not. Lastly, anonymity might bring a feeling of impunity and even its possibility, so a way to avoid that is allowing one profile per person/email, where a fake username can be set, but, in the backstage, the website will know who it is that wrote each comment.
__label__Evidence	The EU member states need to lift together instead of trying to push the burdens onto each other or external nations.
__label__Evidence	minors are unable to make such a life changing decision as cosmetic surgery
__label__Evidence	Agree. Certain words can be filtered and if triggered comment can be removed
__label__Evidence	libertarianism is the ideal for society. it increases freedom and responsibilities. society would flourish, people would be happier.
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Evidence	teachers and children should feel safe in schools and a zero-tolerance policy will be beneficial for all.
__label__Evidence	compulsory voting will lead to a far more representative system of parliament because everyone's vote will be taken into consideration.
__label__Position	Make it so people can only answer in relation to the article and not comment on other people's comments
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Evidence	This article also discusses the use of moderators https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation
__label__Position	It's also useful to identify what constitutes hate speech as what one person finds hateful, another may not. Understanding why certain speech is deemed hateful by the vast majority is also a useful tool in this discussion. https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech
__label__Evidence	The demographic problems for the EU, which are real, must be solved by encouraging child-bearing and a generous family policy, not through migration. We must celebrate motherhood and Moms. We must realize that raising a child involves serious costs in today's Europe.
__label__Evidence	cosmetic surgery should be banned for minors because their bodies haven't even finished developing yet so anything done to correct issues with appearance may be undone by nature anyway.
__label__Evidence	taxation seems to be the only real way to incentivize other countries less worried about climate change to work on it
__label__Evidence	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Evidence	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Evidence	I think this is a great idea and would certainly help the situation if sone correctly.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Evidence	the more people participate in the voting process, the better it is for democracy and society as a whole.
__label__Evidence	we should ban human cloning because it is not fair to the clone who is a living being but has no parents or friends and is essentially a lab experiment
__label__Evidence	fast food is an inexpensive alternative for those that can't afford higher value nutrition or do not have the time to cook and sit for an elaborate supper every day.
__label__Evidence	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Evidence	people who don't want to vote and won't take it seriously should not be forced to vote because they will vote frivolously.
__label__Evidence	Zero-tolerance policies leave no room for explaining mitigating circumstances, which is both unfair to the individual being punished and also sends a negative message to the school community as a whole.
__label__Evidence	Triple talaq should happen in three stages with time gaps. This allows time for reconciliation and arbitration. As instant divorce is a misuse of triple talaq, banning the provision itself is not the solution.
__label__Evidence	zoos often exhibit poor standards of animal welfare, since they are designed to make money for their owners - it is essentially exploitation under the guise of environmental 'protection'.
__label__Position	We all understand the importance of freedom of speech but hate speech cannot be tolerated and for newspapers to continue using the readers comments section its important that they must have a website bot or person who will be responsible in blocking hate speech comments and ensure that individuals who use hate speech are blocked from ever engaging on their platform.
__label__Evidence	we should abolish safe spaces because they take up too much room that could be used for more pressing matters.
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading might be good for those starting out since it takes all the guess work out.
__label__Evidence	subsidizing journalism is unfair. you're basically paying someone to spread your own beliefs.
__label__Evidence	private military companies are a risk to the general public as they are not regulated and therefore should be banned
__label__Evidence	judicial activism can be useful to prevent truly bad people who abuse the letter of the law to skirt punishment.
__label__Evidence	I think we should move internal toilets and bathrooms back outside as these are the greatest historic change in the moisture physics of buildings. Should we do this or embrace out inside toilets as a needed risk to the fabric of buildings to meet todays needs, just as we need to embrace IWI to meet future needs (Richard Lorch)
__label__Position	Freedom of speech is possible without using hate speech. Hate speech should be regulated as it can constitute a crime. The problem with online comment space is that people commenting aren't accountable for what they write. So, unless there is a system where ID is used to set up an account to make comments, then the best solution is to allow comments but to regulate it, moderate it and ensure there are filters so that comments exhibiting racist, homophobic, misogynistic, etc language is removed and the person trying to post such comments are blocked from future commenting.
__label__Evidence	True but having set standards could help reduce it effectively because freedom of speech also comes with responsibility.
__label__Position	In all reality a troll and hate speech will always find its way into civil conversations and areas. The best would be to remove the ability from areas where sensitive people can avoid it.
__label__Evidence	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Position	Catalan should be an official language of the European Parliament
__label__Evidence	It shouldn't be the European families who pay for the damage caused by multinational corporations.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Evidence	we must provide oversight to companies that are overcharging for products and services and providing executive compensation above what is reasonable.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Evidence	forcing children into wearing school uniforms shows our children that they cannot think as individuals and must conform to societies way of thinking.
__label__Evidence	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Evidence	children should be learning and playing, not working
__label__Position	Limitation of words one can post, both minimum and maximum; this would force people to come up with better way of criticising, meaning a less likely chance for hate speech if they have to put in some brainpower to formulate what they want to say
__label__Evidence	capital punishment should absolutely be abolished because it is inhumane to kill a person no matter how badly they behave. an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.
__label__Evidence	it costs too much to build for the games and never use those buildings again
__label__Position	We should ban the use of child actors
__label__Evidence	atheism should be the defacto stance as it is the only provable observance of reality, in that there is absolutely no evidence to prove the contrary.
__label__Evidence	student loans are a good deal for students, student loans allow for some students go to school that may have not been able to go to school before
__label__Evidence	Very appropriate. Hopefully people will interpret this that if they were thinking of posting something bad then keep quiet and don't!
__label__Evidence	atheism should be the defacto standard for all people. If individuals choose to believe in unprovable, invisible super beings from space, it should be kept private and out of official/public spaces.
__label__Evidence	A bot could not fully remove hate speech and could even possibly remove valid points and arguments thinking it was hate speech.
__label__Evidence	Some students do not even understand what they are going through, they may not even know how to ask for help. Having a counselor at their educational institution will help them a lot in understanding their issues. Moreover, they will learn how to ask for advice and help.
__label__Evidence	although I do think that, however, we should consider how many people do in fact post hateful comments without the protection of anonymity. look at Facebook, for instance - it's absolutely full of hate speech from people posting under their names using accounts that people can view and learn more about them. perhaps if people are truly hateful then being known for this isn't a problem for them after all.
__label__Evidence	Not if the idea is hateful to minorities.
__label__Evidence	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Evidence	atheism is the most rational outcome for our society after too many religions have ruined our lives
__label__Evidence	Space exploration is expensive and money should not be wasted on something that will probably never improve life on earth.
__label__Evidence	some illnesses are inherited by one gender or another, sex selection would enable these families to have a child without this illness, it would also result in fewer abortions of children who are the wrong sex.
__label__Evidence	Freedom of speech should be always encouraged
__label__Evidence	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Position	Have filtering algorithms on the newspaper website to filter out comments that could be viewed as hate speech.
__label__Position	I am sorry but NO. Almost the whole human civilisation runs of fossil fuels pumped from the deep carbon cycle to the fast carbon cycle. It will reverse naturally over several million years, not the short-term which we can benefit from right now.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	if people want to go to college, they need to work hard and earn enough to go
__label__Position	We should change corporate accounting rules to include climate change and biodiversity loss
__label__Evidence	human cloning should be banned as it is equivalent to playing god.
__label__Evidence	The government does not have any right to use the taxpayer's money to propagandize the people to encourage what to eat and not to eat. It is not the responsibility of the government.
__label__Evidence	even electric cars are not great for the environment.
__label__Evidence	we should ban the use of child actors because they belong in school
__label__Evidence	gender-neutral language takes gender out of the equation, so that people can focus on content, not gender.
__label__Evidence	we should abolish safe spaces as the appear to be worthless because the extremists always win out.
__label__Evidence	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	By making people aware that hate speech is not good by creating awareness campaigns against hate specch.
__label__Evidence	a non-denominational school prayer is about as bad as reciting the pledge of allegiance in school, and should be allowed.
__label__Evidence	nuclear weapons are destructive and unnecessary
__label__Position	This is a reasonable response to the issue with a reliable source.
__label__Evidence	telemarketing is annoying and leads to people falling for potential scams.
__label__Evidence	Some dissenting opinions and hate comments can spur conversation and be used as a learning opportunity, but it is important for people who use hate speech to be removed from the platform if it becomes too much. The people using the hate speech will become more emboldened and continue to use hate speech if it is allowed to continue.
__label__Evidence	Zoos protect many of the near extinct animals and should be kept open.
__label__Evidence	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Evidence	the world of show has proven to be full of vices that in the case of children is very harmful
__label__Evidence	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Position	https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/073953299701800301?journalCode=nrja
__label__Evidence	collectivism bands people together to solve problems in their communities
__label__Position	Where children are involved, I think it is necessary to filter out hate speech. Dark comments or 'trolls' can be uneducated, and have opinions that are harmful to the developing brain, or just flat-out 'fake news'.
__label__Evidence	It is also very important that the EU does not destroy national progressive labor laws and social protection provisions in third-party countries via Agreements as it tried with Switzerland and the Institutional Framework Agreement.
__label__Evidence	when prostitution moves into a neighborhood, so do drugs and violence
__label__Evidence	we cannot remove reviewer comments altogether. i believe a method to filter or censored hate speech is necessary.
__label__Evidence	the multi-party system works and ensures that everybody has their say
__label__Evidence	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Evidence	Recent congressional hearings have highlighted the chasm between Democrats and Republicans on the issue. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler convened a hearing in the aftermath of the New Zealand attack, saying the internet has aided white nationalism’s international proliferation. “The President’s rhetoric fans the flames with language that—whether intentional or not—may motivate and embolden white supremacist movements,” he said, a charge Republicans on the panel disputed. The Senate Judiciary Committee, led by Ted Cruz, held a nearly simultaneous hearing in which he alleged that major social media companies’ rules disproportionately censor conservative speech, threatening the platforms with federal regulation. Democrats on that panel said Republicans seek to weaken policies dealing with hate speech and disinformation that instead ought to be strengthened.
__label__Evidence	Bursting crackers on Diwali has always been on the to-do list in every family. A Deepavali without firecrackers will definitely be a cut-down in entertainment and recreation for the kids, as well as the elders.
__label__Evidence	But also those people who fear migrants, thinking they are all criminals (while 99% of them are people coming to work, improving their family's life, and paying taxes) will need someone to pay their retirement benefits/ pensions and to push their wheelchairs...
__label__Evidence	economic sanctions rarely hurt those who they are aimed at ,the leaders of nations & instead hurt the people in those countries who can least afford it
__label__Evidence	for multiple reasons the right of intellectual property should not be abolished since it gives others the participation of making their intellect known and putting it into practice in various activities
__label__Evidence	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Evidence	AI is the way to go for sure since there it's not human-based

__label__Evidence	Whaling will threaten to endanger many species of whale.
__label__Evidence	Free speech is the cornerstone of democracy - it can be political but it doesn't have to be. Democracies should protect those that are vulnerable from abuse online whilst also preserving the spirit of free speech. If this balance can't be achieved then it is dictatorship / authoritarian territory.
__label__Evidence	I agree that we, as humans, can adapt to the situation as best as possible. But we can also take small steps towards change. The situation doesn't have to be impossible.
__label__Evidence	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Evidence	we should ban telemarketing since most would agree it is unwanted solicitation. if i am in the market for an item or service, i will contact the company. they should not be contacting me.
__label__Evidence	it is unfair on those being bullied to punish them the same as you punish the bully
__label__Evidence	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Evidence	the right to keep and bear arms is a totally outdated constitutional bedrock that underpins horrifically high rates of gun crime.

__label__Evidence	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Evidence	How are moderators fairly decided upon? Would newspapers choose moderators who would enforce their political ideology? I think this is a quick road to platform-controlled censorship.
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't ban algorithmic trading because it gets more done than using single instructions and it's more systematic
__label__Evidence	telemarketing is an invasive nuisance, and is a platform for many types of fraud.

__label__Evidence	Labelling organisations as terror organisations and labelling individuals as terrorists are quite different. If a person is named as a terrorist, he/she will face social exclusion and will be devoid of livelihood opportunities even if he/she proved otherwise. The consequences will be irreversible. For example, in 2016 alone 67% of the cases ended in acquittal, which means they are probably innocent.

__label__Position	We can reduce hate speech by educating people of the dangers of hate speech on platforms like websites and newspapers.
__label__Evidence	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Position	AI and user moderators can help monitor and regulate harmful comments
__label__Evidence	providing subsidies would allow more money to be spent on the editing process thus making wikepedia a more reliable source of information

__label__Evidence	Each country must have the right to choose based on a democratic vote, how many immigrants they want to accept. The question of immigrants depends on each country's reality and culture: this must be managed at the local level.

__label__Evidence	eliminating the comment section is more like taking peoples freedoms away as people have the right to freedom of expression
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Evidence	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Evidence	A very good point. So-called hate speech is often used by leftists to silence political opponents.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Evidence	No comments means less moderator headaches and potential to offend
__label__Evidence	embryonic stem cell research could lead to the discovery of new medical treatments that would alleviate the suffering of many people
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't legalize organ trade because is horror for familiys
__label__Position	Another way to reduce hate speech in comment sections without having to have someone manually checking each comment is to have AI or an algorithm use filters to filter out comments that have certain trigger words in them and remove them as soon as they are posted. This is not a fool proof method but it would certainly stop a lot of hate speech filtering in and it would negate having someone sit and monitor the comment section of each newspaper.

__label__Evidence	executive compensation should be limited in order to narrow the wage gap between c-level employees and line workers
__label__Evidence	the organ trade would allow for more lives to be saved or improved
__label__Position	Removing the comment space will take away the readers and users freedom of speech and the right to engage on the current affairs which give the newspaper ultimate power without any consequences.
__label__Evidence	we should adopt libertarianism because it gives citizens more freedom to live their live how they want

__label__Evidence	whaling is inhumane and also contributes to the dwindling number of whales in existence, who need protection rather than hunted.
__label__Evidence	Democracy and civilization are the essences of Europe and the EU must uphold those values. For me, the word civilization is also to be civil, which in some way is the opposite of being militarized. The EU should not be a superpower. Nuclear detergence should be enough.
__label__Position	I guess hate speech is open to interpretation. What might be interpreted as hate speech or offensive by me might not be the case for my fellow citizen. So it is a really fine line.

__label__Evidence	Marijuana is part of drug culture so using it leads to other, much more dangerous drug use.
__label__Evidence	If the newspapers are providing a platform on which abuse can be given, they do have a responsibility to prevent it. Abuse is in no way shape or form valid criticism.
__label__Evidence	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Evidence	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes

__label__Evidence	some people who overindulge with plastic surgery may have a mental illness and are on a pathway to self destructive behavior where they are never happy with their new changes
__label__Evidence	I think people having to give personal data will make people think before they post hate speech or negative comments.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.

__label__Evidence	collectivism shouldn't be opposed because societies like this are generally more stable
__label__Evidence	embryonic stem cell research can help the medical community find cures to a lot of fatal illnesses.
__label__Evidence	embryonic stem cell research should be subsidized because it may lead to the development of treatments for a number of serious medical conditions.

__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.

__label__Evidence	serious crimes deserve serious punishment. at it's simplest level, 'an eye for an eye' is still a compelling argument for criminal justice.
__label__Evidence	Unfortunately, newspapers are not always entirely neutral so perhaps they should sign up to some sort of independent moderation
__label__Evidence	There are languages that are spoken by fewer people and are official
__label__Evidence	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Evidence	private military companies rarely actually kill anyone or operate in the manner of the official military. they are used for protection without needing tax payer dollars.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars can help transport those unable to drive themselves
__label__Evidence	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Position	i agree free speech is im portant however it needs to be monitored carefully. free speech can very quickly turn into hate speech leading to crime and violence. much research has been done to show how serious hate speech can be and how much it leads on to other things
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Evidence	i do not support that decision is that without them there would be many terrorists is a measure that helps a lot to this society
__label__Position	There's no easy solution, too much censorship and it gives the trolls a reason to complain, not enough and it allows hate speech to thrive.
__label__Evidence	we should not adopt this, it would be confusing to young children. the way we've done things still works and there's no need to change it.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Evidence	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Evidence	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Evidence	they are the way of the future, and they decrease the amount of road accidents.
__label__Position	once news is exposed to the internet, everyone has access to it, and right to comment any how they feel about the news, but hate speech, so an AI that can detect hate speech should be introduce, in that way it will eliminate hate speech not the space for readers comment section
__label__Evidence	I think moderators are essential for this job to ensure standards are maintained. For some people comment boards and threads may be their only available way to have their opinion heard. However that shouldn't allow for hate speech to be publicly viewed.
__label__Position	I definately think the way forward is to have moderators that will review all comments before they get posted.They can then approve or disapprove all the comments and flag inappropiate user names. Yiou could also add a way for the readers to flag inappropiate comments and these will also flag to the moderators.
__label__Evidence	wikipedia is supported just fine with private donations and has continued to function without the need for a subsidy.
__label__Evidence	Students are and will always be the backbone of the society. It's compulsory to support these growing students in becoming true, well educated citizens to support the economy.
__label__Evidence	These products come mainly from large enterprises, which do not necessarily focus on environmental protection.

__label__Position	Homeschooling should be banned
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Evidence	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Position	I don't have a hard stance on this because I do not feel knowledgeable enough about the issue to say for sure what my ideal solution would be. I agree it is a gigantic problem that needs to be met with urgency and importance by all of us. I don't know that we could reverse climate change, it seems most damage has been done, but I'm hopeful taking stronger actions now would at least help reverse some things, and prevent current issues from developing further. It's worth trying.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Position	Hate speech should be addressed by the public. Those who see the hateful comments should not continue pass it but rather bring it to others attention and stand against what is being said. The problem remains if everyone is not willing to do anything. Once people realise that there are consequences, that is when hate speech will reduce. Read here: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/take-action/engage
__label__Evidence	would be a very good start to flagging hateful people
__label__Evidence	School prayer goes against the separation of the church and government. Prayers in schools only take us back to that time where we were subjugated by religious leaders.
__label__Position	This is a win or loose situation. People will still continue with their comments even if it is not on the newspapers website. A person can take a screenshot of the topic and then twit it on twitter and then people will give their different opinions. The newspaper can still allow for readers comment however, the hate speech comments can be filtered. This is a democratic world and people have a right to have an opinion in what becomes available to them
__label__Evidence	autonomous vehicles will lead to an increase in road accidents
__label__Position	Comments posted by readers must be filtered
__label__Evidence	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Evidence	it is not right to legitimize something that is fundamentally immoral and hurts those who engage in it
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Evidence	this article : https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/830/3/032006 indicates that the algorithm that is considered to be the best for removing hate speech is still only just over 71% effective. This still leaves a lot of room for error.
__label__Evidence	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Evidence	I agree

__label__Evidence	Do not stop free speech, filter out hate speech!
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't ban the church of scientology because banning a religion goes against the constitution
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Evidence	school uniforms take away the freedom of choosing what to wear and create even more problems because students feel as if they already have limits
__label__Evidence	legalizing organ trade would alleviate the shortage of organ donations that the medical system constantly faces.
__label__Position	Comments should be vetted by publishers before posting on newspapers.to avoid hate speeches
__label__Evidence	True, but not every criticism is valid
__label__Evidence	we need to spend money on people who are already alive and need help before we create new ones
__label__Position	We should stop immigration.
__label__Evidence	Immigration should not be part of humanitarian aid. Humanitarian aid should be delivered directly to Africa / Asia. The Turkey deal should eventually be abolished.
__label__Evidence	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Position	The use of admins and moderators can be helpful in removing hate speech. They would need strict rules for the public in order to not let their own personal biases judge what is and isn't considered hate speech.
__label__Evidence	Several member states have been turned into dictatorships a year ago, and there is no sign of a return to democracy. Freezing temporarily their EU membership status is to be considered to those where there is no more freedom in crossing borders (BE), even inside borders (DE, FR), no more press freedom (most), no more debate (most), no more press or individual liberty.
__label__Evidence	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Evidence	the investigations with mother cells could mean the definitive advance for the human race
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Evidence	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Position	systems need to be able to flag hateful speech in posts and remove them timelessly
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Evidence	Juridical protection of dignity, right to life, and integrity of every human being from conception are of fundamental importance for the future of Europe. The dignity and integrity of the human embryo must be respected. This is enounced by the ECJ in the Brüstle vs Greenpeace case, which recalls the definition of the human embryo as the beginning of the development of the human being. To ensure consistency in areas of its competence where the life of the human embryo is at stake, the EU should prohibit that presuppose the destruction of human embryos.

__label__Evidence	nuclear weapons are unique in their destructive power, in the unspeakable human suffering they cause, in the impossibility of controlling their effects in space and time
__label__Evidence	every one has the right to choose what they want to do with their bodies, it isn't in our place to decide if cosmetic surgery is bad for minors.
__label__Evidence	Some other temples also ban women, and some temples ban men. If it is the same situation with Sabarimala, people wouldn't have bothered about it. But treating menstruation as impure and banning women of reproductive age is regressive and need to address. Menstruation is just a biological process. Not allowing menstruating women in temples sends a wrong message to people and future generations.
__label__Evidence	If we raise our children with the same values like our generation did, then we are just fuelling the same viscous circle that destroys our planet
__label__Evidence	if we chose to ban one religion we could end up with all religions banned which would result in war so we should not ban the church of scientology.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Evidence	Zero tolerance policies send a strong signal to students, parents, and the community that violence and bullying will not be tolerated.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Evidence	people should be able to work as long as they want to.
__label__Evidence	we should abolish zoos as animals should not be kept in captivity and should be in a natural environment.

__label__Evidence	sometimes we need to eliminate threats from afar and not risk putting people in more danger so target killing is necessary.

__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Evidence	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Position	By implimenting a system whereby people who use hate speech can be held accountable
__label__Position	By encouraging witneses and victims of hate speech to report hate speech on the internet
__label__Evidence	embryonic stem cell research could help us find new solutions to health problems
__label__Evidence	It is very difficult to police all the contributions
__label__Evidence	You can reduce hate speech in the comment section by flagging certain vocabulary which directly relates to hate speech, which then will automatically block the comment and therefore cannot be posted.
__label__Position	people have varying opinions about issues, and some do not consider their opinions as hate speech even if they are. reducing hate speech therefore will require websites to have a moderator who reads over comments and maybe a disclaimer for readers on what the newspaper considers hate speech.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Evidence	it is not fair to ban whaling whilst allowing farming of cows and sheep for meat. one animals' life should not be valued higher than another.
__label__Evidence	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Evidence	We pay taxes and we have the right to see where our money goes. It’s very easy to implement through an online platform same as digital banking, but for the state. This will stamp out corruption and thereby free up a huge amount of money that we can spend on the needs of the population.
__label__Evidence	Till now, only organizations were designated as terrorist organizations, but not individuals. The loophole in this is the individuals of the banned organizations are forming new organizations and carrying out terror activities. This amendment bill for the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act allows the government to designate individuals as terrorists, thereby terror attacks can be prevented.
__label__Position	There should be automatic filters but they are not 100, so there should also be a team of people constanly monitoring and reviewing complaints and reports. I feel like it is the only way to keep the freedom of speech but also protect people who might be victims of it.
__label__Evidence	we should ban whaling because it is inhumane and because whales are becoming extinct.
__label__Evidence	people should be able to work hard and reap the benefits of their labor. with collectivism you will always have some people doing most of the work and the lazy ones will benefit from it.
__label__Position	Newspaper websites should have AI that auto flags bad comments
__label__Position	Migrants should be housed in EU bureaucrats' neighborhoods
__label__Evidence	Absolutely unacceptable because it would lead to the politicization of the justice system.
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Evidence	Some people may use AI responsibly
__label__Evidence	the poor and less fortunate will always be hurt unfairly by austerity measures
__label__Evidence	uniforms let students be on equal grounds and have them judge each other by character instead of wealth
__label__Evidence	The language barrier and a weak influence on local thinking, allow local propaganda to pass on distorted and untrue information about what is happening in the EU to their citizens. Local governments have easy work to appropriate the positive things that the EU has achieved and, conversely, seduce its own failure on 'European bureaucracy'.

__label__Position	People seem slit 50/50 down the middle one half saying newspapers should not have comments sections it should be one sided and the other half saying get the personal details of the commenters incase they do commit hate speech and I agree with the latte still giving people free speech but monitoring it

__label__Position	I believe that freedom of speech is every human being's right, if it infringes on the human rights of another person then hate speech should be moderated. That being said it now begs the question as what is considered hate speech and the people who moderate the comments consider hate speech as.https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793?cookieSet=1stated in

__label__Evidence	pride parades are a support mechanism to allow gay people to feel that they are not alone and can be proud of who they are.
__label__Evidence	The European Commission has to be independent. It is not allowed to take instructions from any country, lobby group, or anyone else.

__label__Position	if technology is improved, it would make it easier to identify and possibly eliminate hate speech ASAP. furthermore, this will allow the poers that be to identify the people responsible for spreading hate speech and potentially allow for authorities to intervene. hate speech deeply affects and threatens us as humans, therefore it should be taken seriously.

__label__Position	I'm having trouble reading the comments on here. The page keeps moving. I can only confirm what I have already written that comments should be allowed but would have to be moderated in some way. I don't know how this would happen, since there could be too many comments for a human to police. Perhaps a combination of a bot checking comments and a real human might work. I don't think you will completely eliminate hate speech because everyone has different life experiences. It should be up to the individual to realise what makes sense instead of enforcing a kind of nanny state. People should be able to make up their own minds. The issue happens when you become the target and how it can affect you personally. However, I still believe that we need freedom of speech and the only way to stop it is to police the comments and discourage by criminalising it to empower victims.

Triple Talaq violates fundamental rights such as the right to equality, the right to non-discrimination, and the right to live with dignity because this provision is available only for men and not women. Women are subjected to live in fear of being unilaterally divorced by their husbands. This violates their right to live with dignity.

__label__Evidence	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Evidence	marijuana has numerous proven medical benefits.

__label__Evidence	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Evidence	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Position	In summary, I believe that comments should be encouraged, and healthy discussion allowed on these sites. Comment spaces should not be removed but they should be regulated and monitored for such speech. Education should be given to users making hate speech, if this is not successful then punishments should extend froma temporary ban to a permanent one.
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Evidence	allowing unfettered libertarianism will result in more crime and more income disparity
__label__Evidence	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Evidence	Nuclear Weapons are a good defense and allows a nation to protect themselves

__label__Position	Could there be some coding introduced to remove foul language before it's even posted?
__label__Evidence	the olympic games provide employment of many people and are entertaining
__label__Evidence	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Position	Allowing people who have profiles with the website to comment. Anonymity should not be allowed. Information that is traceable to an individual could be implemented(even though may be intrusive) could be requested when creating a profile. Examples, a cellphone number that is FICAd , student number, loyalty card number and the like.
__label__Evidence	we should not abolish the right to keep and bear arms as everyone has a right to keep guns as a mean of protection as stated in the constitution.
__label__Evidence	The issue at hand is not the total elimination of hate speech, but whether it can be reduced on newspaper websites. A newspaper must responsibly manage its public platform, and giving platform to hate speech is a problem it can manage. A newspaper is, by definition, not a forum.
__label__Evidence	We should restrict delocalizing factories to third countries where environmental legislation is softer. We need unique legislation to avoid this.
__label__Evidence	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Position	I always find it frustrating when a newspaper or other online media doesn't have a comments section. It just cuts you off from your audience. Hire somebody or somebodies to moderate. That's all you need to do. It's not rocket science.
__label__Evidence	In my country, and I have no doubt in many others, incitement to hatred is punishable by law. So, when you write that it is not the problem of newspapers or websites, I can only be astonished. It is too easy to start a controversy that may have consequences and to defend it by saying: "we have started a discussion, the outcome is not our responsibility, we wash our hands of it".
__label__Position	I was reading through an article called Thou Shalt Not Hate: Countering Online Hate Speech and it summarized my view quiet fairly on the topic. https://ojs.aaai.org//index.php/ICWSM/article/view/3237/3105
__label__Evidence	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Evidence	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Position	I agree
__label__Evidence	we should because they are extremely dangerous.
__label__Evidence	We should ban private military companies as they are not trained and subject to the same scrutiny as the military.
__label__Position	Nowadays with the amount of social media platforms that are available newspapers don't hold as much power. We get all of our news through the spreading of news in social media as seen in this article : https://kettlemag.co.uk/social-media-versus-print-media/
__label__Position	they need to as often it is minorities which are affected
__label__Evidence	safe spaces don't really serve a beneficial purpose. they don't solve any issues and instead attract a target on to those others may feel are weak or inferior. they cause more harm than good.
__label__Evidence	this is just taking things too far. people should not be offended by pronouns.
__label__Evidence	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	I also believe that a filter or having a group of moderators constantly filtering out the negative - hate speech would be beneficial. Similar to other social media platforms, users of the platform perhaps should be allowed to flag or report comments that aren't appropriate,and then a moderator should check the report and take the steps necessary to make the platform a safe space.
__label__Evidence	everybody has a right to believe whatever wants so church of scientology should be protected and approved.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Position	We should end racial profiling
__label__Position	I think that hate speech should be reduced through widescale education about the origins, hurts and trauma behind words which are used. By educating people learn how to respect or debate in effective ways without insulting or offending. UNESCO are suggesting that addressing hate speech through education can bring respect for each other.
__label__Evidence	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Evidence	The EU should be able to contribute to a relaunch of global multilateralism, through a profound reform based on democracy and peace, solidarity, and respect for human, social, and environmental rights.
__label__Evidence	Persons will have to think before responding.
__label__Position	We should be realistic wrt. migration.
__label__Evidence	Mostly, sales jobs have a variable component. This might negatively impact the employee’s attitude towards customers. They may force the customers irrationally just to make profits for themselves. They might overstate the price to the customers just to make more profit. Whereas, an employee with a fixed salary would maintain healthy and positive relations with the customers, striking the right balance in their approach.
__label__Evidence	A cashless economy saves so much money for governments because printing money, and sending the money to banks requires money and human resources. The need to purchase or rent land for ATMs will also be eliminated. International payments will also be easier because there is no need to exchange currency.
__label__Evidence	it makes a school a safe place for children to learn
__label__Evidence	factory farming is the only way to meet the high demand for meat.
__label__Evidence	judicial activism could lead to a decision being made based on the false beliefs of one person.
__label__Evidence	most people practice a religion so we shouldn't adopt atheism for such a small group of people that don't practice
__label__Position	the should be strong monitoring and assessments before news is published .
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Position	Ensuring there is a process of discipline involved for anyone participating in hate speech. Measures such as warnings or account determination may be taken.
__label__Evidence	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Evidence	It could help but would not solve the problem
__label__Evidence	we need journalists to keep us informed as to what is going on in the world
__label__Evidence	child actors are necessary and children can learn how to work even from an early age
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Evidence	It will bring the EU more jobs, less unemployment, and more added value.
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Evidence	a lot of private resources are needed for military campaigns, such as weapon manufacture. using a private military company is no different.
__label__Evidence	an austerity regime helps to balance the nation's budget and reduce national debt.
__label__Evidence	embyronic stem cell research uses cells that would otherwise just be destroyed.
__label__Evidence	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Evidence	wikipedia is a private entity and is responsible for its own operating costs
__label__Evidence	we should end mandatory retirement because no one has the right to tell another person when they have to stop working. it is an individual's choice and should be left up to them when they wish to call it quits.
__label__Evidence	Schools now contain students of all religions and of none, by forcing these students to pray in schools you are infringing on their human rights, prayer is personal not public in school.
__label__Position	In today's world where technology has advanced to such a degree, I'm of the belief that creating parameters that protect individuals from any form of hate speech is very much possible through things such as AI. The removing of commenting sections could be argued as a violation to one's freedom of speech, it also means the views and opinions of the public will be lost which could have detrimental effects.
__label__Evidence	mandatory retirement is needed to keep businesses new and fresh with innovation from the younger generation.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Evidence	Why do people read comment sections? To get informed and enlightened or because they are nosy and killing time? I think most of the time is the latter. I am not sure the comments expressed at the bottom of a page bring more value to the conversation than they bring potential offence, hatred and fights started just for the fun of it.
__label__Evidence	in some cases cosmetic surgery is essential, such as after accidents, and therefore shouldn't be banned.
__label__Evidence	military companies put their employees at unnecessary risk and should be banned
__label__Evidence	they have already shown that they cannot avoid all accidents.
__label__Position	Control what is printed or posted to make sure that it is diverse and does not contain any hate speech but the message they are trying to get across they are able to. That way newspaper can leave the comment section and different opinions are heard and expressed and no one gets hurt.
__label__Evidence	there is always a need for opinions
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Evidence	sex selection can lead to an over abundance of a favored gender in society
__label__Evidence	everyone should be entitled to free speech
__label__Evidence	However it's more likely that enough people will visit a website, and that there will be enough diverse opinions that the extreme ones (those looking for the argument and attention even) won't have to be given emphasis. So yes, I think your idea works well.
__label__Position	Public transport in EU cities should be free
__label__Evidence	If asylum applications are filed from abroad the security risks for asylum seekers are greatly reduced.
__label__Position	By eliminating the use of certain words
__label__Evidence	sdfdsfsf
__label__Evidence	Don't think we should be censoring people
__label__Evidence	it would stop people being locked up for possession and it would generate revenue
__label__Position	A good way of reducing hate speech on websites of newspapers is to program the AI so that it adheres to the laws of the country that the website belongs to. For example in the UK the AI that moderates comments could use the CPS (https://www.cps.gov.uk/crime-info/hate-crime) definition of hate crime to control the comments.
__label__Evidence	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Evidence	we should ban cosmetic surgery for minors because is nocive for health
__label__Evidence	true
__label__Evidence	We should adopt atheism as then there would be no arguments about religion which seems to be the cause of most wars and disagreements in society.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Position	European Union should help young people to train in refugee countries
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.

__label__Evidence	In the book “iGen”, it was mentioned that in the next decade we may see more young people who know just the right emoji for a situation — but not the right facial expression. This can become true if we prefer virtual life over real life.
__label__Evidence	factory farming concentrates animals in a constricted area, allowing diseases to run rampant through the livestock
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.

__label__Evidence	compulsory voting would see to it that we have the person the people, all the people, truly want in each area of our government.
__label__Evidence	The United States is investing an average of more or less 25 million euros per year on health care research for people with Trisomy 21 while the European Union is lagging far behind with only 3 million per year. This huge difference is proof of the lack of political commitment in the European Union and shows how little the EU prioritizes health care and future health care for people with Trisomy 21.
__label__Evidence	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Evidence	telemarketers selling scams interrupt precious family time with incessant phone calls.
__label__Position	We can fairly reduce hate speech from websites withou teliminating space for readers comments through education on the moderators on what the fine line is, in my opinion!
__label__Evidence	Capital punishment makes the risk of committing a crime that you permanently lose your life and everything that matters to you, increasing the deterrence of the legal system.
__label__Evidence	this already exists on certain websites and you can still easily view hateful comments
__label__Position	By a combination of monitoring and blocking people who leave such comments, and also having suitable laws in place to back this up
__label__Position	Newspaper websites may provide reasons of the consequences of hate speech comments.
__label__Evidence	Even though damage is done, there are ways to counter the damage through other actions. If enough of these are done, they can cumulatively overpower the irreversible actions and thus reduce climate change as a net overall.
__label__Evidence	people should be able to believe whatever they want and not be forced into atheism.
__label__Evidence	We should legalize sex selection because there is no harm to third parties that the government needs to intervene to prevent.
__label__Evidence	looking at the current state of politics around the world it is evident that democracy only exists through vigilance. compulsory voting would help to keep democracy alive when under threat.
__label__Evidence	compulsory voting is not only ridiculous it would also be impossible to enforce.
__label__Evidence	Europe’s sovereignty and credibility are at this price. The burden of European defense cannot rest on the back of a small number of countries and potential conflicts are increasing.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Evidence	We are all here to fight the prohibition of eugenic practices such as abortion which organize and consequently encourage the preventive elimination of individuals who do not comply with the social, medical, and family criteria set by the ideal of man. What a perfect 21st century!
__label__Evidence	judicial activism should be limited because a judge should not be making all decisions.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Evidence	And who would be removing these comments and how do we know that they do not have other motivates behind trying to remove the comment.
__label__Evidence	it is the most effective deterrent to the worst crimes it is a waste of hard working people's money to pay for someone that committed atrocious crimes, to stay in a prison for the rest of their lives
__label__Evidence	if that's what makes people happy then they should be allowed to do it
__label__Evidence	people are free to eat whatever they choose. it's a cheap and fast way for people to get a meal when they are in a hurry or can't afford the expensive organic and natural foods.
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading gives an unfair advantage to those who have access to such technology and results in losses for the "little guy".
__label__Position	A combination of a warning system, detailing what might be considered hate speech and a manual review if potential hate speech is detected as well as on manual reports (allowing brief descriptions for reasons for reporting) seems like a good way to go about it. People who have a history of posting more than one hate comment on the platform should be moderated each time before their comment gets publicised whether it's detected as hate speech by the algorithm or not. They would lose the privilege of being able to comment instantly without review.
__label__Evidence	Its unlikely there will be such software that recognises all slang / racist words
__label__Evidence	It is great to ban them but they would create different profiles again to put out their comments. One good side of this idea is that they would consistently have to do extra work in creating new profiles to put out their hate speeches, and hopefully, one day they would be tired and give up.
__label__Evidence	safe places don't allow people to develop the conflict resolution abilities they may need later in life. it allows one to hide away instead.
__label__Evidence	the school uniform does not allow for the uniqueness and expression of the individual

__label__Evidence	adopting atheism infringes upon people's first amendment right to freedom of religion.
__label__Evidence	journalism is more important than ever in an era of fake news and social media.
__label__Evidence	Three strikes laws reduce the power of judges and discretion in the court room, making judgments shallower.
__label__Evidence	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Evidence	Having to replace an entire mobile phone (or tablet, camera, notebook, etc.) because a battery reached the end of its useful life is infuriating. It is not just a strain on consumers' wallets, it is also devastating for the environment, as the energy and resources going into manufacture of electronics is artificially increased through the short lifespans these devices have.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Evidence	collectivism helps to keep everyone in line since the group can ban anyone that steps out.
__label__Evidence	i agree, people who repeatadly post negative hateful comments need to have suspensions and bans
__label__Position	I think the best bet for reducing hate speech is by moderation. Either be it an actual person or AI. Completely removing comment sections seems like an infringement on freedom of speech.
__label__Position	Develop a software that will not allow posting of any hate speech
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.

__label__Evidence	the loss of experience and knowledge from mandatory retirement is costly to businesses
__label__Evidence	The Dublin Agreement leaves EU member states with an external border completely alone to deal with the challenge of immigration. This must stop! Not only because solidarity in the EU is important for its cohesion, but also because the inevitable overburdening of states left alone with this challenge creates intolerable situations for the refugees.
__label__Evidence	cosmetic surgery can have an enormous impact on increasing self esteem, minors should be allowed to benefit from this as well
__label__Position	Newspapers -should- be taking responsibility for making sure users don't violate hate speech regulations and similar in their comments sections, but simply don't seem to be held accountable when they don't. https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=The%20New%20Governors:%20The%20People,%20Rules%20and%20Processes%20Governing%20Online%20Speech
__label__Evidence	child actors are robbed of their childhood.
__label__Position	The comment section should not have been removed but filter to remove anything that involves hate speech or entices violence, as this limitation revokes people of their freedom of speech
__label__Evidence	pride parades send the wrong message to young children.
__label__Position	This does sound like a difficult one. There is need for moderators and people who can or artificial intelligence that can screen and delete such comments. I do not think that educating people on being nice will work as some are just bitter for nothing.
__label__Position	I believe in democracy, equality and freedom of speech however I do not believe in hate speech therefore I believe that newspaper websites should keep the original essence of the newspaper and not a comment section as other newspaper websites with comment section seem to spread fake news. I think that since we live in a social media world, hence newspaper websites can post their article on them so that people can share their views on the article.
__label__Evidence	missionaries help the less fortunate in third world countries, such as setting up schools and clinics.
__label__Evidence	if a county wants to hunt and kill whales they should be allowed to do so
__label__Evidence	factory farming should be banned because meat quality goes down when animals aren't living in optimal conditions and therefore people are having to eat inferior meat.
__label__Evidence	scientology is a cult that brainwashes people
__label__Evidence	dangerous items should not be allowed in schools because it is endangers the students and faculty and a strict punishment would help prevent these items from being brought.
__label__Evidence	Abolishing death penalty means abandoning the poor -who suffer the most from high crime rates - only so that the elites could feel good about themselves.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	Multiple-party systems often have candidates with radical views whereas two-party systems tend to be more moderate.

__label__Position	I think that growing more trees can reverse the adverse effects of manmade climate change. Trees release fresh oxygen. Protecting the environment is the key to reversing the harmful effects of climate change. It is most important to preserve the natural environment and plant more trees. Trees release oxygen which is very good for health.
__label__Position	We should ban domestic air traffic
__label__Evidence	we should adopt gender-neutral language to make sure everyone is included the way they want to be identified
__label__Position	And any response that limits speech needs to be very carefully weighed to ensure that this remains wholly exceptional, and that legitimate robust debate is not curtailed. refer to this website for more information https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000233231

__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Evidence	we should ban factory farming because it is cruel to animals and the quality is questionable at best.
__label__Evidence	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Evidence	we should adopt atheism because it would be easier than being religious and having so many different beliefs
__label__Evidence	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Position	I believe in an element of balance. Comment spaces should be available to maintain the opportunity for debate and opinion. However, hate speech and bullying should not be tolerated by publications. Moderators should be in place alongside fair 'flagging' systems allowing readers to highlight comments of concern. This could also be used for debates between those commenting, as these can often turn personal.
__label__Evidence	targeted killing should be banned because it often results in the deaths of innocent bystanders
__label__Position	Most comments that understood the question seem to agree that filtering comments with hate speech helps reduce hate speech as well as allowing readers to report inappropiate comments which are then reviewed and deleted. One, I didn't know is regulations within countries that require companies to remove hate speech like in Germany, this will be useful in that companies will take the law seriously to avoid fines and penalties.
__label__Evidence	executives work hard for their companies and should be compensated accordingly.
__label__Evidence	I believe that the problem is not WHAT we eat but rather HOW food is produced. When we talk about meat, we should make a distinction between industrial production (which is damaging our environment) and family-run businesses once (which is not). Instead of prohibiting food (something that is practically speaking impossible to do) we should rather enhance local food solutions and increase people's awareness regarding the impact of their buying choices. Our goal should be making local products and green goods available to everyone and not a privilege of people who are wealthy enough to be able to afford them.
__label__Evidence	we should abolish the right to keep and bear arms to prevent unnecessary killings
__label__Evidence	Cant be onesided as thats too bias, balanced viewpoint is better
__label__Position	I think newspapers should not take away the comment section. Firstly this is unfair to all the people who want to have their say and should be able to do so Dominicis wrong
__label__Position	People will not be aware if they are not taught about something, awareness campaigns need to be made to teach people about the importance of avoiding hatespeech as some of them do it due to the lack of knowlege.
__label__Evidence	we should not adopt gender-neutral language because using specific gender language should not have any specific meaning to a phrase.
__label__Evidence	Safe spaces should be abolished because it just means that people can get out of work, classes, etc if they feel unsafe..
__label__Evidence	allowing cosmetic surgery for minors would simply sweep the real problem under the rug: the effect of toxic appearance standards.
__label__Evidence	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Evidence	embryonic stem cell research can lead to new cures for diseases.
__label__Evidence	Through faith, missionaries are able to develop deep relationships with the communities they serve and help bring much-needed social change to third-world countries.
__label__Position	Based on this thread, most people disagree with the statement so there should be some form of intervention to improve problems with hate speech. I think a fair way is hard to decide on because there are different issues with freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	Europe has more than enough ideological disputes within its own borders. We must settle those first - by falling back on a previous, more classical liberal position that was uncontroversial for most of our citizens. Countries outside the EU must deal with their own problems as best they can. Less interference from Europe is the order of the day, not more.
__label__Evidence	libertarianism maximizes personal freedom and frees people from the inherent debt and tyranny of big government.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Evidence	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Position	Europe should protect bees
__label__Evidence	educating people
__label__Evidence	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Evidence	This will create conditions for the development and education of a Human with a capital “H”, cultivating moral values in each person and society. We should prohibit propaganda of violence, condemnation, and denunciation of any form of division, aggression, and anti-humane manifestations
__label__Evidence	The government must use least restrictive means to avoid encroaching on people's freedoms. As such they should educate and regulate cosmetic surgery for minors instead of banning it.
__label__Evidence	we should ban child actors as a part of banning child labour. exploitation of a child through working is wrong regardless of the specific job role
__label__Evidence	a judge shouldnt be able to show their personal views.
__label__Evidence	Nuclear energy simply is too expensive and hence economically not viable. According to the researchers at RethinkX, we will see a clean energy disruption in the next ten years which will leave investments in oil, coal and nuclear stranded.
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Evidence	the church of scientology is a predatory, litigation-happy organization that serves no good purpose in the world.
__label__Evidence	thats what is wrong with the schools today, they took god out.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Evidence	the olympics is an important international competition that represents peaceful cooperation and brings together the world in friendly competitive sports when the most capable are rewarded for their efforts.
__label__Evidence	parents should be able to chose the sex of their children.
__label__Evidence	we need more government and less libertarianism.
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Evidence	collectivism aims to work toward what is good for all rather than a single person or group, this means a better society for everyone
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't ban whaling because it is so important to many cultures. as long as the whales are sustainably harvested, what is the issue?
__label__Position	We should take polyester and other toxic substances out of clothing and place them with natural materials
__label__Evidence	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Evidence	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Position	A position that surprised me is one that says that "... there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers". Newspapers are run by humans and humans can make mistakes. Also, engagement on current affairs is very helpful should the newspaper article be written in a manner that may be confusing to some people. I think educating people on the devastating impacts of hate speech should be prioritized. Posts with hate speech should be removed and the user who posted it should be educated on why their comment contains hate speech. Education on how to be a socially connected population should also be prioritized. https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech
__label__Evidence	for people undergoing chemotherapy, cannabis can be extremely helpful in regaining appetite for food
__label__Position	I feel that climate change is happening on some level, but question how much of it is due to a natural cycle and how much to human activity. When it comes to stopping pollution and protecting the earth, I am on board. Where I draw the line is using climate change as a platform to implement socialist policies and take excessive freedoms from people.
__label__Position	newspaper websites should regulate social media, and hate speech should be tackled by establishing monitoring and evaluation in newsrooms.
__label__Evidence	Care must be taken not to accidentally block users
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Evidence	I completely agree as people will just go elsewhere and make it much more worse.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Evidence	we should not end mandatory retirement because people need to retire whether they realize it or not, it is not up to them, they of course have no free will.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Evidence	By monitoring the comments, it will make decent people to enjoy the platform and it will make the website respectful
__label__Evidence	It seems like a no-brainer to say something like this, but actually the way, we handle soil, must change massively to halt the climate crisis and mitigate its consequences. Thus we need to recultivate and restore abandoned and contaminated places and shift agriculture to regenerative agriculture or restoration agriculture. We need to stabilize family farms and make them ecologically, financially, and socially sustainable. We need between big and medium-sized farms and also highly productive smallholder farms and wildlife reservoirs. This all depends on a lot of labor, engaged people, and legal and conceptual infrastructure. Having all this in place will foster urban areas as well.
__label__Evidence	Makes sense
__label__Evidence	gender neutral language will allow both genders to be included and liberated to succeed as much as possible. removing gender benefits all and reduces discrimination and suppression.
__label__Evidence	we should not ban cosmetic surgery people some people don't like how they look and it's their money if they want to change that
__label__Position	having comments moderated to ensure no harmful things get posted
__label__Evidence	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Evidence	There must be an area for people to voice their opinions, even if some people use it to display aggression.
__label__Position	It hink a moderation is required for hate speech. Removing the entire comment section is not an ideal option. However, hate speech is alsoa crime. It is clear that there should be some monitoring in social media in terms of tracking down the user when necessary so similar terms with the real world would be valid. If you make a crime in real word you get you will stand trial so similar option should be valid for social media.
__label__Evidence	nuclear weapons are vital to defending ourselves against enemies who are not moral or ethical.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Position	https://www.prio.org/publications/12392 According to Katrine Fangen and Carina Riborg, people who wrote hate speech comments on the newspapers were people who thought themselves as knowladgeable, so they will go on promoting hatred and spreading their ideas even if we eliminate the section of comments: we have to work on the root of the problem, which is education.
__label__Evidence	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Evidence	IPC 375, which criminalizes rape, discriminates married women from using the section on their husbands.
__label__Evidence	Newspapers do not want to face critism by removing comments column, unfair society
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	private military companies should be banned as they are not subject to military laws
__label__Evidence	Disagree. I think that newspapers have always been allowed to 'sell' information, but news sites do so at their own risk by eliminating vast swaths of subscribers and advertisers. A good reliable newspaper is also the best long term business model
__label__Evidence	if they want to be an actor it is their choice
__label__Evidence	Absolutely, and primarily any action has to be taken by civil society. There are examples of good practice within voluntary and non-governmental organisations but these are not yet common practice. The scale and balance of power needs to shift and resources found to develop this work as part of a core purpose.
__label__Evidence	capital punishment is barbaric and should be abolished
__label__Evidence	Agreed. I found a similar article and the more people feel censored the more hate sites thrive. Instead of a platform where people can engage and educate.
__label__Evidence	subsidizing wikipedia will lead to bias in the contents. content creators and moderators will be afraid to criticize the people who contribute money to wikipedia

__label__Evidence	We should adopt a zero-tolerance policy in schools since the current system clearly isn't working and needs a drastic, non tolerant change.
__label__Position	India should store the data within the territorial boundaries of the country
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	in a society full of freedoms should not impose a unique way of manifesting religious beliefs, therefore praying should be something that is done at home, not at school.
__label__Evidence	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Evidence	Racists can no longer hide behind anonymity.
__label__Position	We should ban cosmetic surgery
__label__Evidence	I agree with this. It's important for the newspaper to know how readers feel and react to the content
__label__Evidence	intellectual property is used to smother business, it effectively destroys the free market
__label__Evidence	whaling should be banned. the number of whales is depleting seriously and is a real environmental concern.
__label__Position	And the Govt must give rewards to those who do activities to protect the environment.
__label__Evidence	A humanitarian association that helps a migrant to enter the EU illegally, should lose its government/EU funding.
__label__Evidence	it is true that an echo chamber is inevitable, so
__label__Position	There is always going to be hate speech and comments, that is the way of the world unfortunately these days. But I do think it needs monitored more closely
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Position	I also think that fully restricting hate speech infringes on the right to freedom of speech, yet fully understand that there is a very thin line that can be crossed with freedom of speech which allows people to fully and unfiltered(ly) express themselves, and hate speech which has waaay more damaging effects
__label__Evidence	by subsidizing student loans we can remove one of the stressors from continuing education.
__label__Evidence	we should get rid of the three-strikes law since it hasn't shown to be effective in deterring crime.
__label__Evidence	providing more funding from goverment to speed up embryonic stem cell research can only be for the benefit of the public's health.
__label__Evidence	we should subsidize embryonic stem cell research because it will help many people as long as it is successfully done.
__label__Evidence	I agree. Stable, quality jobs and adequate social protection for everyone are necessary. Trade unions have many proposals to achieve more equal and inclusive labor markets. This goes hand in hand with policies to promote more equal, sustainable, and inclusive societies.
__label__Position	Comments should be monitored before they are published
__label__Evidence	EU bureaucrats who have enabled immigration must be named and a democratic process for removing them from power must be put into place. Democracy must prevail over this multicultural fascism.
__label__Evidence	activist judges are an important part of bringing about legislative change
__label__Evidence	a zero-tolerance policy within schools will help support a healthy environment where students do not feel threatened due to the differences (or perceived differences).
__label__Evidence	mandatory retirement allow new workers a chance
__label__Position	hate speech cannot be fairly reduced. Either you moderate it and will remove what some deem to be unfairly some kind of speech or you don't moderate it and allow hate speech to exist on the platform.
__label__Evidence	the existence of the human being on the earth and its adaptation, and ecological domination are only the result of their natural destiny, for which the selection of sex should not be legalized
__label__Evidence	Safe spaces give people the ability to process issues at their own pace without the added stress of judgement from others.
__label__Evidence	Anonymity may also prevent people to explore ideas they feel are taboo and prevent them from seeking help. e.g. addiction, some LGBTQ+ issues that are taboo in certain cultures etc.
__label__Position	By currating comments individualy in person upon reporting. Auto block certain words e.g N word
__label__Evidence	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Evidence	We should legalize prostitution in order to avoid giving young people criminal records that will hurt their job prospects down the line.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Evidence	we should limit judicial activism because people making rulings on personal opinions instead of the law could set a bad president and other people may try to do the same crime if it is gotten away with
__label__Evidence	Migrants sell drugs.
__label__Position	The fear of migration is a fear of the unknown and is exacerbated.
__label__Position	What if the website somehow blocks words which are hateful or discriminatory from their comment section
__label__Evidence	the olympic games pits countries against each other and can increase levels of discrimination when athletes compete, so therefore it should be banned.
__label__Evidence	Imports from China are hurting the businesses of Indian manufacturers, especially Medium Small &amp; Micro Enterprises (MSME) sector. China is able to produce products for cheaper prices because of its mass production methods.
__label__Evidence	WE SHOuld ban human cloning because it causes huge issues in terms of rights and ownership
__label__Position	Freedom of speech is important, people must be allowed to express their views about social issues that affect them, but it must not infringe on anyone's right either. The solution is to filter comments that contain hate speech
__label__Evidence	I like the idea of allowing readers to flag comments for future moderated review :-)
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Evidence	Requires a lot of moderation
__label__Evidence	it would help to further unite the nations.
__label__Position	We need better ways of migration.
__label__Evidence	economic sanctions are used to bully other nations to act in your own interest, by harming the innocent citizens no less
__label__Evidence	i dont think being able to use hate speech, racist/homophobic language
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Evidence	Countries still catching up to the industrial revolution will argue it unfair.
__label__Evidence	people have the right to eat anything they would like.
__label__Evidence	Sometimes, in the context of a debate, aggressive language is necessarily to demonstrate the emotion of the people and their dissatisfaction
__label__Evidence	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Position	There should be some kinda strict word filtering systems with hired moderators that look through comment to identify potentially or offensive content, and also giving users clear guidance on whats permitted and whats not permitted
__label__Position	A pop-up can be used which reads "if any 'hate speech' comment is discovered, it will be removed from these comments".
__label__Evidence	The attempt to shove the postmodern version of liberalism down Europeans' throats has contributed greatly to the current crisis of the EU.
__label__Position	Moderation is the key to retaining freedom of speech in online spaces without allowing hate speech to be spread. Moderators should be screened beforehand to ensure that they are impartial and capable of identifying and removing forms of hate speech against all groups.
__label__Evidence	it helps small third world countries become more modernized.
__label__Evidence	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Position	It is true that it would be difficult to remove and control all of the comments however i think it would be a lot more damaging to remove the right to freedom of speech.
__label__Position	while newspapers can (and should) moderate their comments, more hate speech is spread more quickly on social media such as facebook
__label__Evidence	prostitution should be legal as it can be controlled & monitored easier & be less dangerous
__label__Evidence	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Position	The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is interestingly tackled in this article
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Evidence	Targeted killing is no different that cold-blooded murder and should be banned.
__label__Evidence	However some people might argue that what they said is not hate speech, and that the newspaper is trying to censor their opinion
__label__Evidence	where compulsory voting exists, in countries like australia, participation rates are the highest in the world. this inevitably leads to more truly representative democracy.
__label__Evidence	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Evidence	economic sanctions usually do not prove to be effective and tend to cause hard feelings between the countries involved.
__label__Evidence	there is no reason why algorithmic trading should be banned , it creates beneficial trading deals and profits for those in the finance sector, and can enhance the value of pension funds for instance.
__label__Position	I think there should be red flagged or blacklisted words that shouldn't be allowed to be used in reader's comments. If a certain post contain such words, it should not be automatically exposed to other readers but should be reviewed first by the admin to check if it meets the standard before being exposed to everyone.
__label__Evidence	Legalizing it would eliminate the black market for cannabis and will also free up prisons of people who are arrested and sentenced for cannabis possession.
__label__Evidence	no one should be forced to do something they do not want to do
__label__Evidence	journalism can make enough income to support itself as is seen by the countless successful media outlets
__label__Evidence	The death penalty is disproportionally used against the poor and minorities.
__label__Evidence	legalising organ trade would put an end to the black market trading.
__label__Position	By having stricter controls over who can sign up to the comments and blocking them from the sites when they use hate speech. It's unfortunate that it happens, but sometimes they are loud just to get attention. Starve them of it.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars can be easily hacked to cause widespread accidents.
__label__Evidence	I strongly agree with this proposal that trade and investment policy should be reformed, especially, that greater attention should be paid to environmental aspects. The current situation is unsatisfactory and even dangerous.
__label__Evidence	tax payers, many of which have not been to school themselves, should not have to pay for any elses student loans.
__label__Position	Frontex should regularly publish transparency reports
__label__Evidence	safe spaces are for people who don't like to talk about the issues in a civilized manner
__label__Position	Newspaper websites are sometimes unnecessary https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1464884911415974?casa_token=RM42P4G5U60AAAAA:n6-vECv4AX2ILnJATk-2H_IyptM37ftGMKhNFh7pdCqtoNvJBWv9PvhvO1FuvRls-A2koV4QHA
__label__Evidence	We should think of more opportunities to enter the EU legally. Many people come illegally, because we refuse them opportunities to come, stay a while for work or education and maybe go back later. People die because of that nonsense.
__label__Evidence	The risk of giving an organ or even part of an organ is very high.
__label__Evidence	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Position	i disagree with the comment of there not being a comment section. what about people who genuinely want to ask a question or leave serious feedback?
__label__Evidence	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Evidence	religion should be a personal matter and the government should not dictate which faiths are allowed and which are not.
__label__Evidence	Migration has been a fact of history and successful societies have found ways to turn migration into strength. In our case in order to alleviate the current challenge in the long term we need to alleviate migration pressure by making it attractive for migrants to stay put and help develop their own countries. Such a helpful project, a European Marshal Plan for Africa would be a good project to invest in. The long-term return on investment would be more than financial: A friendly neighbor continent, good relationships, access to the African market, and natural resources. That is not a short-term fix. And there is no short-term fix. We have to play the long game!
__label__Evidence	people can no longer criticise
__label__Evidence	We should not abolish the Olympic Games as they are viewed as the pinnacle of success for many athletes around the world.
__label__Evidence	safe spaces provide safety for those who are in fear for their safety.
__label__Evidence	I agree with Andrew. It can also be a form of bullying and those most likely to be affected are the more vulnerable people in society.
__label__Evidence	having intellectual property rights is a deterrent for those that would steal another persons ideas and creations so we must not abolish that.

__label__Evidence	Cloning could lead to designer humans and we will lose the diversity of the human race
__label__Evidence	Compulsory voting should be introduced to ensure that the results of elections are completely representative of the population.
__label__Evidence	Reducing scam/spam profiles, or profiles just intended for hate speech protects vulnerable people.
__label__Evidence	whaling is inhumane and should be banned.
__label__Position	You can reduce hate speech from newspapers websites by having it properly monitored. Any hate speach written gets automatically removed.
__label__Evidence	Europe should represent its own interests.
__label__Evidence	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Evidence	We are increasingly witnessing malicious journalism, corrupted by feelings and disinformation. The purpose of the press services must, as soon as possible, be to bring the news back to the public in the most detailed and detailed manner possible, without inciting malicious and incorrect drawing of attention.
__label__Evidence	The standards of Indian cinemas fall at times because of nepotism. Producers and directors are pushing star kids to launch in their movies, failing to judge their acting skills and screen presence. This leads to flop movies and a loss of quality and standards of the Indian cinemas.
__label__Evidence	judges should stick to the law and be unbiased in every ruling.
__label__Evidence	By eliminating the entire comment secion you would be getting rid of the freedom of readers comments
__label__Position	For me, the most surprising position expressed here was that there should be no limits on online commenting by the public. I am concerned that such an approach would lead to dissemination of hateful views by a small minority of commenters. According to www.poynter.org, National Public Radio in the U.S. did a survey and found that only 0.06 per cent of users actually commented on their website and that 491,000 comments actually only came from 20,000 individuals. https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/

__label__Evidence	it is an effective method for lead generation and qualification for marketing.
__label__Evidence	I agree with Ian. It has real life consequences. It is important that moderators can identify hate speech, that is not free speech.
__label__Evidence	executive compensation has hit astronomical levels, widening the pay gap between worker and executive, this has the potential to lead to disharmony and possible conflict.
__label__Evidence	atheism should be adopted as it will put an end to organized religions which have caused wars and deaths over the centuries.
__label__Evidence	prostitution leads to human trafficing.
__label__Evidence	Atheism is a rational response to the world around us and a commonsense rebuttal to the mythology perpetuated by religion.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Evidence	if prostitution was legalized then the women in the profession would have legal recourse if they are treated badly by clients or those who employ them.
__label__Evidence	Allowing cosmetic surgery for minors makes it easy for minors to pressure well-intentioned parents even if it is objectively a bad decision. A ban prevents parents from being put in this situation.
__label__Evidence	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Evidence	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Position	But education and training and awareness are also needed, so people don't repeat what mistakes they have done in the past.
__label__Evidence	the constitution allows for freedom of expression even if you dont personally approve of it
__label__Evidence	sex selection is unnatural and goes against the view that it is up to god to decide the child one will have.
__label__Evidence	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Evidence	Having a moderator and strict rules in place to ban or suspend accounts that express a form of hate speech is needed. Actually replying to that comment as the newspaper will show everyone else that it really is not okay
__label__Evidence	By our actions many species have been made extinct and the chemistry of the gasses that make up our atmosphere have been altered.Climate change caused extinctions are permanent, it follows therefore we cannot wind back the clock.
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Evidence	the school uniform generates in the student respect and adherence to the rules. eliminating the use of school uniform goes against the establishment of routine and responsibility towards the institution
__label__Evidence	missionary work can provide assistance to people who need it.
__label__Evidence	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Position	Today the growing population is struggling to live with the available resources as it is not sufficient to meet the demands of the people , so they have to interfere with the nature and exploiting it . You can say they are using more and more chemical in agriculture to grow more and fast which is not at all good for the human ultimately and to the nature.
__label__Evidence	we should not abolish zoos because it makes it so people can see animals that they may not otherwise be able to see due to their location.
__label__Evidence	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Position	Hate speech has no place in online debate. However, suggestions to use moderators to police forums are heavily flawed, as such processes will be open to personal bias. Who decides what constitutes hate speech? The notion of 'rewiring' perspectives, and 'tracking down' posters seems very authoritarian and not in keeping with a free and democractic society. However, people being unable to post from anonymous accounts would probably be beneficial.
__label__Evidence	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Evidence	Already we are ruin the nature to observe the CO2 and other gases.Now we are expecting the solution in technology side.It is not fully solution for change the climate.So we want to focus the nature resources management.
__label__Evidence	Safe spaces create an echo chamber where only currently accepted ideas are allowed to be spoken and any dissent is blocked out, preventing change and growth.
__label__Position	We can rely on Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoins
__label__Evidence	Since neo-banks are completely digital, they operate 24 hours a day and their services can be accessed at any time. They are easy to access from anywhere through a smartphone.
__label__Evidence	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button
__label__Position	We should ban missionary work
__label__Evidence	I totattluy disagree because.....
__label__Evidence	There is no way to restrict speech without censorship...so remove the option to comment rather than to censor.
__label__Evidence	This would help to plan the most efficient and economical itinerary
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Evidence	human cloning is not good for humanity, less for evolution
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Evidence	if retirees continue to work past retirement age, there will never be a natural progression through the workplace for the younger generation.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Evidence	Legalizing prostitution would increase tax revenue for the government.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Evidence	Capital punishment can be replaced by more ethical but equally punishing alternatives, like life without parole.
__label__Evidence	this would be very difficult to police, although i do think its a good starting point
__label__Evidence	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Evidence	we should not ban human cloning because this will lessen our chances for finding cures to the some of the most deadly diseases such as cancer and dementia
__label__Position	It can be reduced by warning people of the actions which will be taken by the newspaper article if they come across hate speech comments.
__label__Evidence	when everything else fails the government should be allowed to curb all superfluous spending within.
__label__Evidence	fast food is no more unhealthy than some gourmet food its just cheaper and made with less costly ingredients. fast food is not the issue, lack of control in eating it is the reason people are fat.
__label__Evidence	judicial activism should be limited because law making is best done by the legislative and executive branches of government
__label__Evidence	Don't delete the comment section, at some point you will realise that some criticism are inconsequential
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Evidence	we should not prohibit school prayer because this country was founded and based on the christian belief system.
__label__Evidence	Because hate speech causes so many unwanted consequences, this kind of liberal approach doesn't seem fruitful. Although education and counter-speech are important (https://www.coe.int/en/web/european-commission-against-racism-and-intolerance/hate-speech-and-violence), we have to protect free speech while eliminating comments that incite violence.
__label__Evidence	a zero-tolerance policy in schools provides a structured and safe environment for children to learn.
__label__Evidence	but AI is still weak right now to filter hate speech comments efficiently
__label__Evidence	I agree with your opinion. I think trying to find ways to moderate the comments (either automatically or by a team of humans) would be a good step. Then it's also up to the responsability of the users themselves to have a good attitude.
__label__Evidence	We should not abolish safe spaces because they don't harm anyone, since people are still free to speak their minds in all other settings, and this is a tiny imposition upon them.
__label__Evidence	The political composition of the European Council - and therefore the EU’s political center of gravity - continuously changes during the EU political cycle, thus preventing clearer government majorities to emerge within these two European Councils.
__label__Evidence	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Evidence	private military companies take the pressure away from the regular military leaving them less thin on the ground.
__label__Position	But the virtual world its not a problem. we as people are the ones with unresolved matters
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Evidence	The number of IT jobs is increasing at a rapid rate due to the tech revolution. So, there will be more jobs in the IT field. And if the recruiters are very strict about the degree, they may miss a large pool of talent, who are of a non-IT background.
__label__Evidence	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Evidence	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Evidence	We should not subsidize journalism because there is already sufficient coverage of major issues from different viewpoints without government action.
__label__Evidence	economic sanctions help end bad behaviors.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Evidence	This is very true and I think that by focusing on educating others before they decide to give an opinion as most hate speech is just a form of ignorance from others.
__label__Evidence	This article is interesting - perhaps a suggestion to use moderating language, or an agreement to respond politely and moderately, should be 'e-signed' by users before contributing.
__label__Evidence	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Evidence	Legalizing organ trade would allow rich people to stay healthy at the expense of poor people putting themselves at risk, creating an unfair society.
__label__Position	there is nothing to be fair about, hate speech must be eradicated totally from the online publication.
__label__Evidence	People should be allowed to choose how to believe freely and not forced to accept the beliefs of atheism. Each person has a mind and can make their own decision and should be allowed the freedom of choice.
__label__Evidence	some people do not feel capable of exercising such a responsibility
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	I have no illusions that rich and influential people will find a way to get as much meat as they want and then distribute it on the black market.
__label__Evidence	we should not cancel pride parades because it would be an infingement of freedom of expression and of the right to free speech.
__label__Evidence	students have the right to express themselves, and that includes expressions of faith.
__label__Evidence	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Evidence	judges are to base decisions on the laws of the country not on their personal beliefs. when a judge puts his bias to a case it can change laws and not support the rights of the individual.
__label__Evidence	Speech cannot be violence in and of itself. What you are suggesting closes down public forums and debate, enhancing the impact of closed minded thinking and echo chambers in our society.
__label__Evidence	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Evidence	space exploration is important for the development and growth of human society and knowledge and should be invested in by the government.
__label__Evidence	with todays progression it only makes sense, then we wont insult people.
__label__Position	Rich nations rigged poor (powerless) nations. By choosing bio-fuel or dams solutions they just sentencing poor nations to extinction
__label__Evidence	telemarketing is a nuisance that antagonises potential customers of a business
__label__Position	Freedom of speech will not be resiticted if we monitor hate speech. there has to be a line drawn, and this is the line.
__label__Evidence	we should ban the church of scientology because any church that has "cult like" teachings should never be allowed to exist.
__label__Evidence	I am happy to see that the ide of haling all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is still going strong. This message needs to be communicated to Brussels very clearly.
__label__Evidence	people have the right to enhance their body in any way they want to.
__label__Evidence	there are too many gender conformities that we wouldnt be able to come up with gender-neutral language
__label__Evidence	we should ban the church of scientology as people may not recognise it as a true religion
__label__Evidence	Children can better explore themselves when they do not have constraints.
__label__Evidence	telemarketing employs thousands of people
__label__Evidence	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Evidence	the end does not justify the means, the factory farming is cruel, inhuman and immoral, you. you can argue what you want, but that does not erase the facts.
__label__Evidence	whaling is a tradition with some native groups and they need the meat to survive through winter
__label__Evidence	Stops hates speech
__label__Evidence	zoos do so much for the conservation of animals and species that are at risk of being extinct and they should not be abolished.
__label__Position	I think the best solution is a self-policing reporting system. Allowing the users themselves to have a say in what is problematic would save a lot of time otherwise needed to moderate the platform.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a big issue on the internet and social media in general, it is a very bad idea to eliminate comment sections in their entirety. Doing this can give rise to extremist websites whether they are on the left or right. There are many ways to control it but each has their own pros and cons. At this point it is impossible to know which method is the best, the best option would be to run tests and see how the users react.
__label__Evidence	telemarketing is a valid means of advertising and is not dangerous for the people
__label__Position	It has been shown that comments sections are popular and do drive traffic to websites and make people spend more time on the site (so pleasing advertisers) So from a commercial/publishing point of view it would seem that some kind of moderation is the best way to deal with the problem and not eliminate the section altogether. (See https://webpublisherpro.com/your-website-needs-a-comments-section/)
__label__Evidence	factory farming should not be banned as it allows for cost effective production of valuable and necessary food
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Evidence	people should have a right of ownership to their creations, ideas, and concepts that they created themselves.
__label__Position	The EU should change its internal structure.
__label__Position	We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources
__label__Evidence	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Evidence	pride marches are an important and vital political activity for lgbt people and provide a necessary visibility.
__label__Position	The European Parliament should be dissolved and replaced with a global government.
__label__Evidence	Zoos offer an easy and cheap way for people to see and learn about animals from all over the world.
__label__Position	Rural areas should become more attractive for life and work
__label__Position	Devices with batteries should be designed so that batteries can be replaced
__label__Evidence	Journalism is a vital source of real information and news to make sure people are properly informed about the world so subsidizing it would help ensure that it continues without bias.
__label__Evidence	an austerity regime will help to reduce the deficit of the country
__label__Evidence	In general, a few teachers punish students, who are not scoring well in exams but they do not even try to understand whether they have any learning disabilities. This causes self-esteem issues in students. Psychologists can detect these learning disabilities and can detect these issues and can collaborate with teachers to draft teaching strategies that are suitable for students with learning disabilities.
__label__Evidence	Everyone is entitled to their opinions
__label__Evidence	Having a comment section approver would be costly to the newspaper. Maybe algorithms can be used instead?
__label__Evidence	without regulations and welfare, society would collapse into vast pools of crime and poverty
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Evidence	there is need of moderators so people know they are being monitored and they can behave themselves also a filtering of swear words would help
__label__Evidence	whaling is quite a profitable profession.
__label__Evidence	the olympic games cause turmoil and a lot of money.
__label__Evidence	That is an interesting point. It would need to be an impartial party. I know sometimes FB and other social media platforms use algorithms to hide certain posts (usually due to language) so maybe that could be one answer?
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't limit executive compensation. the whole point of becoming an executive is working up the ladder for years in order to receive the six figure salary and lucrative bonuses.
__label__Evidence	Yes, any form of hate speech should never be tolerated.
__label__Evidence	executive compensation is not always effective and takes away from the rest of the employees who do most of the strenuous work
__label__Evidence	it is sometimes necessary to act in a preemptive manner with cases of truly dangerous terrorists and national threats - reliance on the normal extradition process is too slow, and can cost lives.
__label__Evidence	they shouldnt be banned, it's just people coming together and expressing themselves which they have the right to do.
__label__Position	No, free speech should be a right despite of the positive/negative approach
__label__Evidence	they cost too much money and we waste too many resources on the olympics.
__label__Evidence	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Evidence	an austerity regime would be harmful
__label__Evidence	There are always other spaces, such as reddit or twitter, where one can discuss articles- they do not have to be discussed on the same page they are presented
__label__Position	I don't think this is possible. We should go back to physical printed newspapers.
__label__Evidence	with so much sexual freedom these days prostitution should now be legal.
__label__Evidence	The recent crisis on the Polish border only underlines the urgency of this proposal.
__label__Evidence	banning fast food is an example of regulations which take away our right to freedom.
__label__Evidence	Reality shows give opportunity for children to bring out their hidden talents and to finess their skills.
__label__Position	I don't believe eliminating space for readers comments is a fair practice. People should be free to express their opinion. Hate speech can be a problem. However, simply turning off comments is not going to eliminate hatred; it will only sweep the problem under the carpet. In fact, allowing people to vent in the comment sections can serve as an escape valve for the negative emotions.
__label__Evidence	This is what most social media companies already do. Often the AI sensors the conversation based on the pre-selected criteria without the intervention of any human moderator, because there is too much traffic for humans to monitor. This leads to a reduction in free-speech.
__label__Evidence	It seems that the EU is much more concerned with the rights of sexual minorities than with ethnic minorities. This is a universal problem for all ethnic minorities in the EU. Outside the EU, there are even more severe problems. Ukraine, for instance, forces kids to study in Ukrainian, refusing them and their parents the right to receive an education in the language they choose. Seems utterly barbaric in the 21st century, but the EU does nothing about this, despite the influence it holds over Kyiv.
__label__Evidence	Any expression that freely and openly gives a clear point that will not offend or insult anyone is not hate speech
__label__Evidence	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Evidence	pride parades allow marginalized groups to have a space in order to gather and celebrate and boost their self-esteem.
__label__Evidence	Moderator bias
__label__Evidence	We are Europeans; this is not racism but we don't support growth. If we accept many immigrants then we make a huge stop in the growth of the migrant countries, because I am 100% sure that they will never ever go back to their country.
__label__Evidence	journalism and free expression of information and exchange of ideas is a basic human right, and subsidizing this would improve its quality and reach.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Evidence	we should continue to support algorithmic trading as it gives orders a jump start rather than waiting until the complete order has been produced.
__label__Evidence	we should not ban private military companies as a person should have the right if they can afford to hire such companies to protect them.
__label__Evidence	There is a spread of policies that come under the heading of population control ranging from the coercive to the persuasive.
__label__Evidence	I agree
__label__Evidence	This is especially true when we know how much alcohol is damaging the brain, in particular in the developing brain of teenagers. Also unlike cannabis, over-consumption of alcohol leads to death so I would say that this product is much more dangerous. Yet unlike cannabis, alcohol is legal.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Position	I think with the modern technology it's possible to find a common ground between not allowing any comment spaces and wild-west commentary. Hate Speech and the upholding of free speech is an shakey equilibrium. Certainly, the news outlets are in a special position in this case.
__label__Position	I think it should be possible to filter out certain triggerwords with AI-Programs. Sure it is not the most optimal soltion. But perhaps more convinient for the first moments in a heated conversation.
__label__Evidence	athletes train their whole lives in hopes that they can represent their country to be the best.
__label__Evidence	factory farming is much more efficient and takes up much less space. should we switch, large amounts of habitat would have to be destroyed to accommodate. this would also increase the prices of meat.
__label__Evidence	We should end mandatory retirement because it removes people who are knowledgeable and skilled from jobs that they are good at.
__label__Evidence	for some people who suffer from poor self esteem, cosmetic surgery can offer hope.
__label__Position	REMOVAL OF HATE SPEECH DOESN'T ENTAIL THAT THE SOCIETY IS NOT DEMOCRATIC.I BELIEVE IT IS SAFE SINCE NEWSPAPERS ACCOMODATES DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS FROM DIFFERENT SOCIETIES.SO BASIC NON HATE SPEECH LANGUAGE IS FAIR TO MY OWN POINT OF VIEW
__label__Evidence	an austerity regime allows for the restructuring of economic for a country which can provide financial benefits.
__label__Position	Many are saying that any form of moderation or removing comment sections is censorship, and that hate speech is just an inevitable fact of life, but moderating hate speech is arguably key to protecting and nurturing free speech. See this argument from the United Nations: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech
__label__Position	hate speech is still free speech tho
__label__Evidence	i believe the government should help pay for journalism because it would allow for better coverage of news events, and help pay the high costs of filming.
__label__Evidence	subsidization may allow those providing the finances to have influence on entries that are in their interest
__label__Evidence	factory farming is a cost effective method of food production which allows everyone to access expensive foods at a better price
__label__Evidence	judicial activism allows for common sense to be applied where necessary
__label__Evidence	factory farming brings meat down to a price affordable to the poorest in our community on a regular basis
__label__Evidence	I agree with the idea that anonymity on the Internet often has the consequence to make it easier for people to harass / be horrible to each others.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	taxis are already available for people that want to be driven so autonomous cars aren't necessary.
__label__Evidence	fast food is a great option for people who are to busy to sit down for a meal.
__label__Evidence	mandatory retirement allows new workers to take the place of older workers that are past their prime and just need to retire.
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading helps people trade with a smaller risk of financial losses.
__label__Evidence	we should not legalize prostitution why do we have to do this are there any countries now that made prostitution legal?
__label__Evidence	embryonic stem cell research can create significant, life saving advancements in medicine.
__label__Position	Agreed
__label__Evidence	we should cancel pride parades as we need to stop support single groups of people as it only causes more strife.
__label__Evidence	whaling is no different to any other kind of hunting which are not protested against.
__label__Evidence	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Evidence	Legalizing prostitution will allow prostitutes to actually report and press charges against problematic pimps and johns, something they can't do right now.
__label__Evidence	all crimes are not equal with thee strikes laws murder is the same as jay walking. each crime should include a number of factors and not just an arbitrary number.
__label__Position	Hate speech on newspaper websites can be reduced by checking for swear words or any vulgar language that maybe present in the comment but it should not be disabled because people have freedom of speech and cancelling the comment section will not only affect those who make bad comments but also those who give insights and engage positively with the content
__label__Position	removing the comment section is not a solution to addressing hate speech. The important is not censored viewer comments but to censored hate speech. there are a few options to consider to address this:
__label__Evidence	We should not ban cosmetic surgery for minors because there are legitimate cases when it would improve a young person's mental health.
__label__Position	up to this point, moderators have done a poor job as evidenced by the amount of hate speech so maybe the answer is simply to remove the ability to comment.
__label__Evidence	As technology becomes more advanced, there are algorithms that detect hate speech, for example on Twitter. People can also report hateful comments so that only appropiate comments are left.
__label__Position	I believer that it is important to allow comments to encourage dialogue and varied opinions. Perhaps stipulating the rules of what behaviour is accepted in the comments section would assist in reducing the level of hate speech, although there are trolls who feed off doing so. The following article quotes: Dr Philips’ colleague, College of Charleston assistant professor of communication Ryan Milner, studies participatory media and public conversation. He tells me something similar when I ask him if comment sections should be the exception or rule of websites. https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation I think it could be a mistake to make them ‘the rule’ and then just leave them there unattended. I think if you want a comment section – and I believe in the power of voice to public engagement, mounting evidence to the contrary – then it has to [be] alongside a commitment to curating civil engagement. This means technological, editorial, and social steps to make them the agora you want them to be.
__label__Evidence	abolishing safe spaces has to be recognized because people who has such a problems already have support from institutions and doctors.
__label__Position	We should improve migration policies
__label__Evidence	countries that used sex selection, like china, now have a problem with two many older men and not enough women to marry them and have more children for the next generation.
__label__Evidence	The downside to this is who is going to moderate it - where is the baseline of what is acceptable and what is not. It's a real challenge.
__label__Evidence	the olympic games is now redundant as a sporting competition because there are so many professional competitions for sports.
__label__Evidence	There is a spread of policies that come under the heading of population control ranging from the coercive to the persuasive.
__label__Position	The Western Balkans should join the EU immediately
__label__Position	https://www.prio.org/publications/12392 According to Katrine Fangen and Carina Riborg, people who wrote hate speech comments on the newspapers were people who thought themselves as knowladgeable, so they will go on promoting hatred and spreading their ideas even if we eliminate the section of comments: we have to work on the root of the problem, which is education.
__label__Evidence	What does legal migration look like? People can only ask for asylum from within the EU and must officially do so at the Point of Entry. This has caused inhumane circumstances as we see at Camp Moria in Greece.
__label__Evidence	Three strikes laws are perfectly constitutional since the punishment isn't unusual and they are proportional to frequency of crime if not intensity of criminal action.
__label__Evidence	I agree with this, this tools can be helpful in reducing hate speech
__label__Evidence	we should definitely oppose collectivism because there is less autonomy in terms of thoughts and ideas. everyone will just go along with the group.
__label__Evidence	we should not ban the church of scientology because people should be able to be whatever religion they want
__label__Evidence	we should end mandatory retirement because not all people have the same stamina as others and can work longer than others.
__label__Evidence	subsidizing journalism could raise questions about bias and editorial independence.
__label__Evidence	It is not possible to technically change the climate problem
__label__Evidence	private military companies are in it for the financial gain and does not adhere to the morals of civilian casualties.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Evidence	we should ban missionary work if people are torturing or hurting non believers as has been reported in the past
__label__Evidence	With high-quality advertisements and marketing practices, junk food manufacturers are manipulating children to buy their foods. This Fit India Movement will make children think about the negative consequences of junk food. As a result, this movement will encourage children to consume healthy food.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them.

__label__Position	The EU should start accession negotiations with Russia
__label__Evidence	Nobody should have to see it regardless.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Evidence	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Evidence	School uniforms are too expensive and many parents can not afford the extra expense.
__label__Evidence	whaling provides jobs and income for many people
__label__Evidence	private military companies can provide many security benefits within our country
__label__Evidence	whaling disturbs the delicate balance of sea life
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Evidence	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Evidence	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Evidence	to support gay people then we should allow pride parades
__label__Evidence	telemarketing is a job for some and banning it would take jobs away.
__label__Evidence	sex selection promotes abortion and gender inequality
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Evidence	Large bureaucratic organizations such as the EU are the product of the industrial age and unfortunately, without significant reforms, they will not survive the digital age. The digital age leads to decentralization and cost-efficiency such as a decentralized flow of information (e.g. Internet) and money (e.g. Bitcoin) without the need for centralized control which is very expensive to maintain (i.e. EU).
__label__Evidence	the onus will be on the poorest people in the population to sell their organs thus leading to exploitation.
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Evidence	Gender neutral language can be very confusing and simply serves to emphasize the difference between those who consider themselves binary and those who do not
__label__Evidence	there is a risk of children exploitation by forcing them to act things they wouldn't normally do in life
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Evidence	collectivism prevents original thoughts and discourages people from looking for their own ideas
__label__Position	newspapers should not have a comments section.
__label__Evidence	mandatory retirement ages are inconsistent with modern workplace practices and are contrary to the desire for age equality
__label__Evidence	elections are supposed to be won by the opinion of the people. if only a select few people vote, then the result only reflects their opinions, not that of the whole population.
__label__Evidence	Why can't Arab countries shelter refugees from other Arab countries? Same habits, religion and they have enough wealth.
__label__Evidence	I would agree that a moderator system would be a better choice than removing the comments.
__label__Position	Although not specific to newspaper websites, this article shows that hate crime online has increased by over 200 incidents just from 2015 to 2018 so if the trend continues it is thought that this may now have increased to over 500 anti-sematism online incidents. https://www.turing.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2019-11/online_abuse_prevalence_full_24.11.2019_-_formatted_0.pdf
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Evidence	people should have the freedom to believe in a way of their choice. atheism forces people to believe in one way and this is not the principle of freedom the usa was founded upon.
__label__Evidence	we should not support the austerity regime because it takes away from programs that are most needed such as feeding children.
__label__Evidence	Children are not able to consent or conceptualize permanent changes which result from cosmetic surgery.
__label__Evidence	prayer in school should be prohibited because it violates the separation of prayer and state
__label__Evidence	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Evidence	Nuclear weapons can accidentally lead to radiation disaster.
__label__Position	Europe must help Ukraine
__label__Position	We should further develop the European integration process into a federation
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Evidence	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Evidence	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Evidence	missionary work preaches false information to the most unfortunate of the world.
__label__Evidence	But if people ́s right to speek is crossing the border towards hatered speech then you are disregarding another ́s right of respect
__label__Position	There should be a president for the EU elected by the people.
__label__Position	By monitoring the comment section and holding people liable for their hateful speech.
__label__Evidence	Absolutely! With the current developments in technology we have enough tools to reduce hate speech without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Evidence	we should legalize prostitution because it is going to happen no matter what, so allow it legally so the women can be safe and get the proper care needed in this profession.
__label__Evidence	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Evidence	I can agree with this as Newspapers are not government or public services, they are companies trying to sell newspapers and subscriptions to their services for profit, the comments sections are there to bring more revenue into the company and keep more people logged in and using their websites
__label__Position	NEET exam should be banned
__label__Evidence	the olympics provide a way for nations to come together to foster mutual understanding.
__label__Position	We should make living wages a human right
__label__Position	Check this out https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/03/29/the-future-of-free-speech-trolls-anonymity-and-fake-news-online/
__label__Evidence	the country only has a certain amount of money, and it would be used better to help people here on earth than to explore space.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Evidence	It's arrogant to tell us we should look for another name. Germans and Italians are Europeans just like Serbians or Macedonians. In the other words, Brits can call themselves Europeans and so can we! Therefore EU citizens are European.
__label__Evidence	the funding required to train athletes and host the games is a huge waste of public resources. this could be better spent on life saving and life changing services
__label__Evidence	freedom to choose a religion is a human right
__label__Position	I believe that having free speech is totally fine but comments that are offensive, hate speech or discriminatory in any way should be removed. The comment section should be monitored.
__label__Evidence	mandatory voting is the best way to ensure that elected officials truly reflect the will of the people.
__label__Evidence	Very funny.
__label__Evidence	No duck would like to live with eagles or sparrows. That's nature, not wishful thinking.
__label__Evidence	I think this already happens on some sites (flagging offensive comments) and is a good way of ensuring any comments which may offend someone, can be moderated and removed if necessary.
__label__Position	Policy makers have vested interests with industry to ignore signals of overshoot and straining risks. Whatever action will be taken too late and there is no way to prevent feedback loops
__label__Evidence	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Position	I'm finding replying to comments here really awkward. As soon as I start typing the page moves, grrrr! However, I don't agree with vetting comments. I do agree with free speech, but not hate speech. People are entitled to an opinion without having to be nasty or a keyboard warrior. Moderating could be used to take out hateful comments, without taking away a well rounded debate, but where those lines are drawn is anyones guess!
__label__Evidence	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Evidence	we should limit judicial activism as it goes outside the set laws and eventually could go to far to one person creating their own agendas.
__label__Evidence	We should abolish safe spaces because there are better ways to protect people with ptsd like content warnings, rather than safe spaces.
__label__Evidence	After so many years, so many wars, and so many forced exiles all over Europe and all over the world, it may be time to rectify our errors and return the old given rights to the many national groups that have been eliminated by force or conquest or undesired immigration. There is now a good example of this happening in Ukraine by the Russian occupation.
__label__Evidence	we should ban targeted killing as it is an unfair advantage to those that do not have the same equipment.
__label__Evidence	Legisation should be applied based on same principles thoughout countries to preserve freedom of speech and also ensure hate speech and arising violence is eliminated
__label__Evidence	Whilst moderation can be good, you're at the whims of the moderators own thoughts and prejudices. And at times may not be acting in the interests of the organisation they're working for.
__label__Evidence	Intellectual property rights slows down the speed with which people have access to technology, goods and ideas that could transfrom their lives so should be abolished.
__label__Evidence	pride parades can get dangerous and out of control
__label__Evidence	we should not ban because it helps people feel good about themselves and improve their confidence.
__label__Evidence	we should not legalize cannabis because it can be a "gateway" drug.
__label__Evidence	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Evidence	a multi-party system allows for the airing of more viewpoints and would require politicians to build coalitions and compromise in order to get things accomplished.
__label__Evidence	with executive compensation a person is more likely to risk the viability of the company for short term gains, thereby hurting people at the bottom
__label__Evidence	if someone hasn't learned by the first two chances then they aren't going to stop committing crimes. it makes more sense to lock them away than to let them keep committing crimes against the population.
__label__Evidence	schools are part of the state system. since we have a legal obligation to keep the separation of church and state we can't allow prayer in schools as this would violate that.
__label__Position	1. Only allow verified accounts to post - these accounts should be easily traced back to individuals. 2. Moderate comments with both algorithms and human visibility. 3. Prosecute.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Evidence	people should be free to choose for themselves
__label__Evidence	Not allowing anonymous posts will turn off individuals from commenting, that's limiting the ideas that others could have contributed
__label__Position	I see a lot of opinions on here that newspaper websites are not responsible to 'police' their platform and that free speech should be allowed. In many parts of the world hate speech and racism are not protected by freedom of speech laws. While I do agree that newspaper websites should allow free discussion and different opinions on their platforms, this does not mean they have to allow hate speech and discriminatory language.
__label__Evidence	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Position	I believe a mixture of AI, and human moderation is needed to help the situation. Comments are needed in newspaper websites.
__label__Evidence	we should not ban missionary work because a lot of progress has been made because of it in poor countries.
__label__Evidence	Helping migrants learn the language and culture of the country they are living in are critical to successful integration. Language and norms of the job market and workplace should also be built in.
__label__Evidence	sex selection will have troublesome effects on gender disparity.
__label__Evidence	people are free to practice any religion they want
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Evidence	parents should be able to utilize any technological advances they wish in order to build their ideal family.
__label__Evidence	libertarianism sounds brilliant as a theory, but government and societies require rules and frameworks to function, and abolishing these would only lead to chaos.
__label__Evidence	A humanitarian association that helps a migrant to enter the EU illegally, should lose its government/EU funding.
__label__Evidence	libertarianism promotes freedom and liberty in the more fair form for all. the foundation of our country is built on these ideas. there is more equality and freedom through libertarianism.
__label__Evidence	We should not adopt an austerity regime because counter cyclical spending leads to better outcomes for the economy than austerity.
__label__Evidence	school uniforms make life so much easier. there's less for parents to buy, a lot can't afford name brand clothing. less bullying due to clothing. it's easier to get ready in the morning.
__label__Evidence	should uniforms are costly and children should be allowed to where their own cheaper clothes
__label__Position	This is a complicated topic with no easy answers. I think it is reasonable for each website to have their own company policy that discourages hate speech on their platform. This could be achieved via human or algorithmic checking, the blanket ban of certain words and phrases, or some form of community accountability that downvotes or reports certain comments.
__label__Evidence	it is everybody's right to have cosmetic surgery those that want it, including children, should have access
__label__Evidence	The European Union is doing amazingly well in relation to the enormous bad publicity it is receiving from all sides. And as if that were not enough in itself, very large countries from around the world are doing constantly dividing work between member states. As all successes start in your head, perhaps some attention should be allocated to the media. The EU has a clear chance to become one of the major poles of this multipolar world order.
__label__Evidence	Good Argument but at the same time we must look at how it affect people live most people commit suised because of hate speech
__label__Evidence	the olympic games are the one event that can bring all countries together in unity and should never be abolished.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Evidence	Nuclear weapons prevent conflicts from dragging onward because once they are used involved countries lose the motivation to continue fighting (re: Hiroshima and Nagasaki).
__label__Position	ithink the best thing to do is to not have comments as that can really alter someone elses perception. Especially in this day and age people tend to rely on comments to then pass their own judgement and that can cause hate speech. However if the comments were to still be present i think an idea would be to mute comments that incite any type of hate.
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Evidence	wikipedia is a private organisation,the government should not get involved.
__label__Evidence	freedom of religion is freedom of religion. there is no picking and choosing based on how others feel about it. let the people do as they please, even if it's church of scientology.
__label__Position	I think websites can also try to filter out words that represent hate speech, so that when a person types the word out, it automatically declines to send their comment.
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't prohibit school prayer because is important for religious education
__label__Evidence	economic sanctions can put pressure on the regime in power. it reduces their ability to buy weapons of oppression and the ability to keep their economy healthy. it can be effective in the right circumstances.
__label__Evidence	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Evidence	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Evidence	I recently read that especially African families tend to send their smartest, best educated youngsters abroad to improve the family situation. These people are desperately needed both for the future of their home countries and for our future. We need skilled & educated people in many sectors, but sends such people back to their home countries, because they were unfortunate enough to be refugees.
__label__Evidence	targeting killing takes the lives of innocent people that are in the wrong place at the wrong time
__label__Position	We should decriminalize drug use

__label__Evidence	Migrants have an enormous amount to offer in energy, new ideas, and cultures. Why this emphasis on imaginary 'takeovers'?
__label__Evidence	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	Report button on every comment so that people can report hate speech from other users. This would require an actual person or software to evaluate the reported comments

__label__Evidence	Incentive to perform at the highest levels and attractiveness of position are important factors in maintaining a competitive and successful company in a fast moving and aggressive marketplace.
__label__Evidence	executive compensation should be limited so that those in power, influential positions in companies do not abuse their power in pursuit of obscene amounts of money.
__label__Position	The EU should implement a common pension fund
__label__Evidence	there are always exceptions to everything so zero-tolerance policies are not good because it doesn't allow for any exceptions.
__label__Evidence	education is important to ensure the continued progress of humanity and to move humanity forwards; for this reason we should subsidise loans for students.
__label__Position	I think comments should definitely not be deleted. It's a lazy way of reducing free speech.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	this helps cover more issues; the current government is too short staffed to deal with all of the problems.
__label__Evidence	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Evidence	people should be judged by their actions not how the judge feels about them
__label__Evidence	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Position	We should sop unrestricted deforestation and logging
__label__Evidence	stem cell research is the beginning of wanting to do more and more things we shouldn't be messing with and it should be stopped now before it goes any further
__label__Evidence	The EU should attract the world's most talented and most entrepreneurial. There was an attempt to reform the blue card directive by the Junker commission in order to create a new streamlined EU-wide visa category, similar to the short-lived Schengen visa. The holder of the new blue-card-like visa would have the entire EU labor market at their disposal.
__label__Evidence	I think that is an excellent idea, perhaps using some form of AI could be used to cut down costs.
__label__Evidence	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Evidence	We should abolish safe spaces because they put public funding for universities at risk, due to backlash from right wing legislatures.
__label__Evidence	I think everyone has a right to freedom of speech, no one should be censored
__label__Position	We need to be very clear about what constitutes hate speech and create severe punishments for those that spread it.
__label__Evidence	Subsidizing journalism can create jobs, thus lowering unemployment.
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Evidence	they serve as a deterant for any rogue dictator to strike an enemy
__label__Position	after going through other peoples positions i can say the filtering of hate comments might no be hundred percent effective but i still recommend it. i think the newspaper will not be nice without the interaction between the audience and the writer.
__label__Evidence	uniforms create equality and create a sense of belonging in the group
__label__Position	The comments that people make could be reviewed by a machine that learns the difference between an opinion and hate speech which can determine what comments can be on newspaper sites
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Evidence	nuclear weapons shouldn't exist and if used erroneously could destroy the planet
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Evidence	minors cannot be trusted to make decisions about cosmetic surgery that may affect them adversely as they grow up.
__label__Evidence	Migration has been a fact of history and successful societies have found ways to turn migration into strength. In our case in order to alleviate the current challenge in the long term we need to alleviate migration pressure by making it attractive for migrants to stay put and help develop their own countries. Such a helpful project, a European Marshal Plan for Africa would be a good project to invest in. The long-term return on investment would be more than financial: A friendly neighbor continent, good relationships, access to the African market, and natural resources. That is not a short-term fix. And there is no short-term fix. We have to play the long game!
__label__Evidence	collectivism means that everyone has equal access to facilities.
__label__Evidence	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Position	removing the comment section is not a solution to addressing hate speech. The important is not censored viewer comments but to censored hate speech. there are a few options to consider to address this: 1. only registered viewers can make comments. personal information such as identification information that can be used to directly identify the individual commenting. this will reduce hate speech for fear of being exposed in real life and possibly charged with a criminal offense. 2. comments that come through should be filtered through a platform before being posted. 3. addressing hate speech through education is also another option. however, this assumes that people making such comments are not aware of the comments that they make. https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000380290
__label__Position	Removing hate speech comments is also not a good thing because with the technology that we have, people will go and create fake accounts and still go back to comment hatefully and disrespecting words of which it will be a daunting task to delete all the comments
__label__Evidence	animals in zoos are miserable and confined.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars can help people to do more long distance traveling that will allow them to arrive refreshed and less anxious.
__label__Evidence	cosmetic surgery is unnecessary and does not provide health benefits
__label__Evidence	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	In as much as we would like to shy away from it, it is inevitable that people will have something negative to say. It is up to the developers of the website to filter through comments or at least set an approval time for each post.
__label__Evidence	we should ban human cloning because playing god can be dangerous.
__label__Evidence	we should not legalize prostitution. it is not right for women or men to make a living by having sex. it will lead to a society in which marriages fall apart and children are harmed in the process.
__label__Evidence	we should not abolish zoos as they contribute to the breeding of endangered species and the reintroduction of animals to the wild
__label__Evidence	historically missionaries have interfered in an unhealthy way with other cultures and continue to do so.

__label__Evidence	people should be able to decide themselves if they want to use it
__label__Evidence	compulsory voting is an infringement on personal choice
__label__Position	By developing a system that will automatically eliminate any hate speech comments before some sort of publication.
__label__Evidence	embryonic stem cell research are using human eggs to grow in a lab. these eggs could have been humans. we are trying to play god and going beyond human rights.

__label__Evidence	The three-strikes law gives victims peace of mind that the person who perpetuated a crime against them won't one day return and harm them again.

__label__Evidence	Do you have a source reference? and replaces culture? (if heritage is added as the 4th) (Cherry)

__label__Evidence	missionary work interferes with freedom of religion, as natives are forced to convert in order to receive aid.
__label__Evidence	minors are too young to know what they are doing so make them wait until they are adults and better able to make these types of decisions
__label__Evidence	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Position	Monitor comments (using technology)and block users that leave such comments
__label__Evidence	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Evidence	subsidizing wikipedia is unnecessary. it's isn't in need of a subsidy. it's doing just fine on it's donations. there's no staff to pay, it's all volunteer. there's no need to waste funds on this.
__label__Evidence	We have a deficit in democracy in the EU because of the lack of coverage of European affairs in our media. It's also the reason why people don't know much about the EU and don't understand how it benefits us all.
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading removes the human element of common sense from trading patterns, which has caused many wild mini-crashes and market fluctuations.
__label__Evidence	we should accept safe spaces because it lets people freely speak their mind without consequence
__label__Evidence	uniform policies detract from more effective efforts to reduce problems in education
__label__Evidence	An idea doesn't have to be aggressive to be classed as hate speech. It could be dismissive or belittling, or just downright repugnant. Would you be happy to see Nazi opinions put forward in a happy, smiley way?
__label__Position	I think removing the comment space is just avoiding the problem. There can be interesting and thoughtful comments and we would miss from them. Newspapers websites should instead try to regulate the comment space by introducing a bot or hiring appropriate moderators or there should be some punishment to discourage the use of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	private military companies are often run by former military men and women and provide a service that allows the military to concentrate on military operations.
__label__Evidence	Organs, as part of our bodies, are our property and should not be regulated by the government; we should be free to sell them on an open market.
__label__Position	I feel that all users should provide true identification that can be used if they use hate speech to find them/report them.
__label__Evidence	journalism is self sustaining and subsidizing it gives the government control over content.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Position	We should abolish safe spaces
__label__Evidence	there are better things the government can do with that money.

__label__Evidence	libertarianism would never function in practice due to the ruling government having all its authority amputated - chaos and disorder would reign supreme.
__label__Evidence	'Natural' languages were never designed to be used for international communication. They reflect their own cultures and are perfect for use in their own communities, but the international language has different requirements. Esperanto has been specifically designed for this purpose, as an auxiliary language, one that can bring people together. It needs serious consideration!
__label__Position	We need to move towards drug reform, which will change our outdated drug policy.

__label__Evidence	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Evidence	Its ok to have some negative comments as long as they are balanced and not offensive or personal
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Evidence	I think hate speech should be reduced as much as possible if not removed completely. This is very different from being able to provide constructive criticism which should always be allowed but there are boundaries.
__label__Evidence	But who is going to pay for all thee changes? Big business surely will not foot the bill and pour own government in the USA is in so much debt already that we are nearing an economic collapse
__label__Evidence	we should subsidize space exploration because we're running out of resources on earth. space is filled with infinite resources. if we're not first, other countries will benefit while we're left behind.
__label__Evidence	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Evidence	why should every country in the EU be sovereign in energy production? Within the countries also not every region is sovereign in this sense. We need to take advantage of the geographic potentials of the european continent for pragmatic solutions
__label__Evidence	killing is against the law so it should be banned.
__label__Evidence	we need to abolish intellectual property rights and let people innovate and create without having to worry about who owns what

__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Evidence	we need the olympic games to bring the nations together in a non confrontational contest.
__label__Position	Removing the comment section all together is a fair point as news is meant to be fair and impartial. People share their opinions based on their biases and that's not what the news is for - that's what social media is for. But in this case allowing the comment section to remain would be great if people would not abuse the power to share freely by sharing hate speech and slander. us as humans need to be regulated by a set of rules in order to keep a functioning society and i think a filtered comment section is the solution.
__label__Evidence	HATE SPEECH is speech that is vulgar and intended to offend.

__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

__label__Evidence	collectivism can achieve more that individuals alone
__label__Evidence	Our decision-making skills are also getting affected as we are now asking search engines to know what is best. We are depending on the knowledge base of the internet even at offices to finish the work at hand. This affects cognitive skills ( to think, read, learn, remember, and reason), which is an essential quality of humans.

__label__Evidence	WikiLeaks has won a number of awards, including The Economist's New Media Award in 2008 and Amnesty International's UK Media Award in 2009.
__label__Evidence	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Evidence	compulsory voting should not be necessary because people will vote for anyone without researching which could skew outcomes.

__label__Position	I think it would be a good idea to have someone or people depending how active the site is, monitoring the websites and all posted comments should be checked before being posted.
__label__Evidence	legalization of marijuana will create a huge industry that utilizes people for profit and targets children
__label__Position	If a Newspaper wants to allow comments on their site and then they have to expect that hate speech and other negative comments will eventually appear, with this in mind I think moderation (and first line computer based monitoring which can pickup up common words phrases and other easy stuff automatically) has got to be the least they can do, along with making their terms and conditions and other warnings easily visible during registration and prior to posting. Any comments section (of any website, not just newspapers) is a target for negative extreme comments and unfortunately it is part of the Internet in its current form which easily allows anonymity to all who use it.

__label__Position	We could add a moderating element to the newspaper site in order to prevent hurtful comments
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment

__label__Evidence	autonomous cars would help people who are disabled be able to have their own transportation.
__label__Position	I think that the idea of users submitting personal data before making a comment can have positive and negative effects - positive in the sense that the user may think twice before posting hate speech and that they can be tracked down and educated; negative in the sense that the user could be on a website that wants to use user's personal data for the wrong reasons. I am still of the view that comments with hate speech need to be filtered out because each individual needs to be responsible in their speech.
__label__Evidence	It is getter harder year by year by still possible.
__label__Position	There must be a team of moderators, who constantly look at new comments being posted, and approve them to be visible for others, or remove if inappropriate.

__label__Position	We should stop integration.
__label__Position	Newspaper articles can be very biased based on the views and opinions of the reporter, so a comment section is essential for allowing people to share alternative views and point out biases. Other methods should be found to reduce hate speech in comments, such as moderation or reporting of comments.

__label__Evidence	There is much greater wealth disparity in a libertarian society.
__label__Evidence	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Evidence	What we are now seeing are the first waves of a human tsunami. In sub-Saharan Africa, over years the population will have grown to 2,0 billion. That is more than the people who live in the EU and US today. At the same time, the Population in the EU is shrinking. When we keep the border open the EU as a viable society will disappear. Not much of a future for the young Europeans.

__label__Evidence	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Evidence	Having rules will make online engagement respectful.
__label__Evidence	prostitution preys on vulnerable workers, many of which are provided through human trafficking.
__label__Position	Numerous positions have already been provided and the following represents my summary/reconcilliation of said positions: IF the objective is to *reduce* hate speech without eliminating the opportunity for readers to comment, we must be careful and consider our options with forethought. Others have mentioned before that the authomatic censorship on the basis of keywords is a convenient, one-time-implementation approach to reducing hate speech. On this, I agree. Certain words (unambiguously profane or mired in hatred) should trigger the system to not post a comment (and further, shadowban a given user for some determined amount of time [or post attempts]). Software is not a substitute for human judgement, though, and there are always ways for people to circumvent software-based enforcement (e.g., simply writing profanity with punctuation between letters so as to still convey the same hateful message). Thus, *some* degree of human intervention is necessary. Having said that, the use of human moderators is also prone to certain flaws (someone mentioned personal bias; I mentioned emotional labour, burnout, and high turnover on the part of the moderators). One option that has some historic precedent is to crowdsource the task of regulating content (e.g., as in the case of Reddit, wherein the audience has the ability to "upvote" or "downvote" individuals' responses. This is not without its flaw as it may quickly spiral into a hivemind type situation (furthermore, ad populum is indeed a logical fallacy). We are also reminded that "letting the free market decide what happens" is a dangerous game. What I'd advise, therefore, is at least a tri-partite solution: The use of software to automatically screen and filter out the most heinous of comments that happen to include inexcusable hate-words, a public that has the power to upvote/downvote, and a moderation team that has the authority to overide the former two (in case a perfectly legitimate but unpopular post is racking up downvotes simply for going against the status quo despite not necessarily being hateful in intention). A TEAM of moderators will reduce the probability that any one single person's bias is unduly influencing a given decision. This is NOT a perfect solution, but I think it attempts to incorporate the goodness of many other solutions previously mentioned.
__label__Evidence	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	people who comment hate speech should be banned
__label__Evidence	fast food is quickly leading to child obesity and an unhealthy generation.
__label__Evidence	We should ban targeted killing as it just legalized murder and should not be allowed.

__label__Evidence	Cheap and accessible train travel brings everyone closer together regardless of borders
__label__Position	We should ban live-bait fishing within the EU
__label__Evidence	nuclear weapons create unnecessary political tensions
__label__Evidence	A common digital platform where data will be recorded in an anonymized way could also be very helpful for the future not only in case of new pandemic situations. However, as data itself has a market value and as we have learned about the global interdependency in an emergency situation e.g. with vaccines, no company should capitalize on this data. The data should be accessible for public research and used for monitoring public health e.g. by European institutions
__label__Evidence	Not necessarily. I think opinions are okay but not when it is hate and discrimination. Thinking morally that is wrong and shouldn't be allowed on any type of platform.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	fast food is no good for anyone because it makes people fat and unhealthy.
__label__Evidence	We should abolish safe spaces because because they are used to silence legitimate viewpoints.
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading is a technological improvement on antiquated methods of trading and should be encouraged and improved.
__label__Evidence	If asylum applications are filed from abroad the humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean sea is ended.
__label__Evidence	the olympic games have become prohibitively expensive to host. it is not worth spending billions for an event that is two weeks long.
__label__Evidence	libertarianism is better than anything else at keeping peace
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Evidence	As we are transitioning into a more extensive digital age every day we still should not forget that as we age it gets harder to be quick with digital news, information, and advances in society. Therefore even right now our current older generations and future older generations need a physical touch point where competent people would be able to introduce on the spot what that one person as a citizen of the European Union can do that exact day to influence the benefit of Europe and their country.
__label__Evidence	embryonic stem cell research will help save lives and is very important.
__label__Evidence	But there is a major difference between " white people should die" and "I have a dislike towards the white race are statistically more
__label__Evidence	targeted killing is the best way to eliminate threats without risking additional loss of life and it should not be banned.
__label__Position	I do not think it is possible, in a fair and just way. When speech is restricted that's called censorship. Who would justify the restrictive opinion?
__label__Evidence	collectivity, a group of people can get far more done than individually.
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't adopt libertarianism because not everyone seems to think about things in the same way, some people have no interest in politics at all
__label__Position	We can reduce hate speech by holding the owner of the platform accountable for hate speech being on their platform, this will force the platform owners to put strict systems in place to ensure this does not occur.
__label__Evidence	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Evidence	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Position	Reduce the number of comments.

__label__Evidence	prayer is a healing and spiritual experience for many people and they should be allowed to practice it anywhere they wish
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Position	https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/ The article linked here shows the outcome for many outlets who faced the issue of hate spech in their comment sections. One who disabled the section turned it back on eventually. And a leading newspaper actually invested in the comment sections, and provides the ability for readers & staffers to 'spotlight' top comments. This enhances my position that comment sections should not be removed and instead moderated and positive discussion allowed.
__label__Evidence	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Position	hate speech shouldnt be eliminated because some mewspaper online post fake news so when people comment whatever they want it helps all of us a freedom of choice
__label__Evidence	unchecked journalism can lead to biases, paid content, and sow seeds of distrust in the media.
__label__Evidence	three strikes is too many and dangerous criminals will be on the loose again too quickly.
__label__Evidence	student loan debt is an enormous pressure on working people, and should be subsidized.
__label__Evidence	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Position	If readers are not allowed to comment on what is on the media, then I don't see the need for the media to be even there in the first place if it is not for the people or the public. The better approach would be to rid the comment section of any sensitive or offensive words
__label__Evidence	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Evidence	Reality shows put enormous pressure on participants to perform well every time. Children cannot handle this stress, and this may cause mental health issues. Almost all reality shows involve the process of eliminating participants one by one at each level. Facing defeat in front of everyone is not that easy for children. This may put an emotional toll on children.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Evidence	Some violent and extreme behaviours in schools deserve a fierce and sharp reaction.
__label__Evidence	people have the right to choose any religion they with, atheism should not be forced upon them.
__label__Position	We must make sure that we read news from trusted sources only or use reliable social media
__label__Evidence	A high score in the NEET exam is required to get admission to government medical colleges in India. It costs approximately Rs.1.25 crores to study in private medical colleges in India. So, many students are forced to go to other countries such as China, Ukraine, Russia, the Philippines, etc. to pursue medical education. In those countries, medical education costs around Rs.35 lakhs. Moreover, they allow students with low NEET scores, but above cut-off marks.
__label__Evidence	factory agriculture lowers the costs of the products and ensures its production throughout the year
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	People who choose to comment on newspapers articles are usually not a representative sample of the general population. Depending on which platform you are on, the views and opinions might be skewed. However, that can open the doors to interesting discussions. Moderating comments is a better approach when trying to get rid of hate speech
__label__Evidence	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Evidence	it is a great idea
__label__Position	totally agree!
__label__Evidence	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Evidence	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Evidence	In Conclusion, we should say: 'Europeans go home. Go home, leave every part of the world where we are making business, exploiting cheap labor, rare minerals, selling arms, invading foreign countries and exporting democracy, etc. '
__label__Evidence	there would be no hate speech
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

__label__Evidence	economic sanctions can assist in deterring deadly threats against our nation
__label__Evidence	in a fast paced society a quick meal is a blessing
__label__Evidence	many animals would become extinct if we did not have zoos.
__label__Evidence	Doing nothing because of a fear that doing something will be ineffective, means simply that nothing will definitely be achieved. Freedom of speech is definitely curtailed if people who are likely to be attacked are themselves, afraid to speak. The experience of CreepyPMs in keeping their site open, friendly and inclusive, using 30 moderators for a relatively small site and a tough policy where in essence that comments must be conductive to a supportive environment and if not, can be removed, even if they have not violated a specific rule, seems to potentially curtail freedom of speech and could silence valid criticism but can also "allow marginalised and targeted individuals who are not likely to share their stories or opinions when the door is left open to the rest of the world" to speak. https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation
__label__Evidence	This would strengthen the carbon sinks across Europa.
__label__Position	There should be no comment area in order to limit hate speech. Newspapers should be one-sided sources of information.
__label__Evidence	I agree over-censorship is a negative, but there are laws about hate speech that should be upheld.
__label__Position	Being and advocate of freeing people from hate speech or reducing the verbal abuse that happens on the internet is not necessarily advocating against freedom of speech. As much as there should be freedom of speech people should also be free from abuse. The safety of people should be a priority. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-020-03737-6
__label__Position	the comment section should not be disabled as is it there for the readers to engage with the content uploaded so it makes no sense to close it, however there should be restrictions.
__label__Evidence	it should not be prohibited, i think that the military also has the right to set up their businesses and companies
__label__Evidence	we should adopt gender-neutral language because it will stop people from being offended from misidentifying them
__label__Evidence	the use of gender pronouns tends to single out one gender from the other and can be offensive to some.
__label__Evidence	we are propagating unnatural and unattainable beauty norms by fueling an industry that operates on those that can afford it, to look as close to perfect as possible
__label__Evidence	Hate speech is some fairly clear definitions, particularly around race and gender [https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech], so it really shouldn't be hard to identify clearly offensive comments directed at a person or group of persons, over valid criticism. The only danger is if the moderator is also biased and does not like an opinion, but in these cases, an independent review will clearly show an abuse of moderator power.
__label__Position	Hate speech invites violence and undermines people
__label__Evidence	without further testing and experimentation, the outcome of human cloning will never be known so should not be banned.
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading has increased trading which is good for the economy
__label__Evidence	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Evidence	capital punishment is the only acceptable punishment for some heinous crimes because they are so evil, life in prison is not enough.
__label__Evidence	a multi-party system will help to ensure that more political agendas will be given the chance to represent the people
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Evidence	yes i argree with this. it would not show that the newspaper is biased by leaving the positive comments only
__label__Evidence	I agree that Comments should we posted then flagged by the public. If it has a certain number of flags it should then be reviewed. This is good as it is up to the public if they find a comment to be hate speech and t is not just up to one person as people have issues being impartial. https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/alternative-truths/201006/the-persistent-illusion-impartiality

__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	the three strikes law is an old concept. it doesn't really prevent people from committing violence, especially because many acts of violence are not premeditated.
__label__Position	I am still of the standing that some type of programme should be used to identify hate speech key words or phrases and remove comments that include them.
__label__Evidence	Mandatory retirement is discriminatory on the basis of age, which is an immutable characteristic much like gender or race in that one has no control over it.
__label__Position	Comment sections are meant for social media platforms. The newspaper can post on a platform such as twitter in order to get comments - while disabling comments on their own platform.
__label__Position	2. We can not dictate how media houses run their operations
__label__Evidence	There is a lack of security and defense policy that can realistically be achieved by strengthening the Euro body as the 28th European army.
__label__Evidence	mandatory retirement is unfair to people who need a job when social security cannot pay the bills
__label__Evidence	people need rules to maintain a civil society
__label__Evidence	pmcs should be banned, as they are profiting from war and destruction. it is their interest to cause and prolong discord in the world.
__label__Position	some words should be muted or not allowed to be used in newspapers, because they are offensive or they contribute to hate speech
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Evidence	https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/study-social-media-use-linked-to-decline-mental-health
__label__Position	We should legalize prostitution
__label__Evidence	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Position	We are privileged to live in a society with free speech, it is important to keep it this way. Providing a voting system within a comment section allows for free speech to continue and the most relevant comments to remain at the top.
__label__Position	Comment sections are useful and needed, but there should be some monitoring and regulations in place to ensure that hateful comments are reduced. A reporting system and a list of banned words would help, as would a system where moderators could approve or deny posts containing images. Reported comments, once reviewed, could be completely deleted or quarantined depending on the severity of the post in question. In some case, quarantining posts to be hidden unless unhidden by individual users could allow the flow of posts to be followed and understood within the context of a conversation. This is a similar system to what is already in place in social media platforms such as Facebook and Reddit.
__label__Evidence	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Evidence	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Evidence	zoos make it possible to protect endangered animals from extinction
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Evidence	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Evidence	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Evidence	children should be allowed to work in performing arts or professional sports, a ban does not make sense, nothing bad is being done
__label__Position	We should establish a 100% tax on the rent of land in Europe
__label__Position	not all stories need people to add their opinions sothat should ease the pressure on moderators
__label__Position	Learning and unlearning hateful speech has to come from education, being used an early intervention method would likely support a reduction in hate speech overall and therefore in newspapers
__label__Position	I'd happily see all comments sections removed for the good of the public in general. Nobody needs to know that Tony from Bognor thinks All Them Lot Should Go Home, because Tony is a twat who shouldn't be given a platform.
__label__Evidence	everyone has the right to follow whatever religion they want regardless of how strange it may seem to outsiders.
__label__Evidence	this would possibly eliminate the war between democrats and republicans.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Evidence	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Evidence	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Evidence	minors should be able to make decisions to have cosmetic surgery if it will help their self-confidence.
__label__Evidence	everyone needs a place where they can be accepted without judgment.
__label__Position	Hate speech, although in many cases is specifically excluded from freedom of speech, is often difficult to regulate. In such cases then subjectivity or bias can be used and that could be seen as a violation of the right to freedom of expression. This makes the whole situation a grey area and it is only by further encouraging dialogue and conversation that can we get closer to a definitive answer on this. Here is an article that addresses the trouble with regulating hate speech. https://www.thefire.org/is-hate-speech-protected-by-the-first-amendment/
__label__Evidence	capital punishment has done nothing to actually deter serious crime in this country
__label__Evidence	libertarianism should not be adopted as it will give too much power to businesses and rich people to do whatever they want.
__label__Evidence	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Evidence	legalizing organ trade could result in more criminal murders which is not acceptable.
__label__Evidence	we shouldnt because people might just vote for anyone if they have no interest in politics and could sway the vote.
__label__Evidence	I totally agree.
__label__Position	We need family and child protection against political agendas until their adulthood
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Evidence	Freedom of speech is important but it's important we use it in the correct way. If what we are saying results in bullying then that should be shutdown.
__label__Evidence	economic sanctions can help force countries to provide better treatment for the common people of that country.
__label__Evidence	i agree with you, many people do not want to retire, they want to continue trading, and they are forced to retire
__label__Evidence	school uniforms restrict students to make their own decisions and choices
__label__Evidence	A European army is not only needed to attack and defend but to give weight to European words.
__label__Evidence	organ trade facilitates better health for those who can afford it and better financial outcomes for thouse who provide the organs, hence it should be legalized.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Position	The use of the comments section is mainly to engage readers, but may be obsolete, and is there because it has always been there.....we should re evaluate its usefulness
__label__Evidence	we should ban human cloning because it is against the natural law and it is morally wrong
__label__Evidence	Hate speech is used to intentionally hurt others. It cannot be allowed in modern-day society and should not be seen as free-speech
__label__Evidence	de-emphasizing gender in every day conversation will have long term benefits for humanity.
__label__Evidence	An increased percentage of funds dedicated to cities and regions that are controlled and distributed from the EU institutions directly to the local administrations can bypass the national systems which enable the political dependency in the first place.
__label__Evidence	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Evidence	cosmetic surgery increases women's self-esteem and makes them more self-confident
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?

__label__Evidence	many people who are not capable to drive, would be able to commute easily with autonomous cars
__label__Evidence	telemarketing is a useful marketing tool for companies to gain new customers.
__label__Position	It might work better if there is a clear process for other readers to be able to escalate or report comments that are offensive, incite hate or otherwise in breach of the code of conduct.
__label__Evidence	The law is very clear that RTI is not just concerned with government bodies alone. It is also for Non-Government Organisations which are substantially financed and controlled by the Government. There are numerous subsidies (including Tax exemptions) that the Political parties enjoy, thereby, they are substantially financed by the Government.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars will bring mobility to the disabled.
__label__Evidence	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Position	comments should be monitored by AI for certain phrases and reactions. A reporting feature can be used to flag posts and remove them either by AI or a real person
__label__Evidence	legalizing prostitution could allow for regulations that make prostitutes and the people that use their services safer and healthier.
__label__Evidence	There is no certainty that the process will be a success, and couples may end up wasting time and money.
__label__Evidence	olympic games cost a lot of money for the host city to organise and the money could be spent better elsewhere
__label__Position	The EU needs more effective policies to combat online hate speech
__label__Evidence	cosmetic surgery is ruining the confidence of young girls and making them feel like their not good enough without such surgeries.
__label__Evidence	school prayer is exclusionary and should be abolished. schools now have children of many different nationalities and faiths and they should not be forced to listen to prayer from another religion.
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Position	The creation of a safe space within the comments section run by moderators around the clock with the assistance of software that roots out keywords that could be hate speech and a swift report and block system to deny access to people violating the rules
__label__Evidence	a person needs to be able to choose to work as long as they are well enough to do so.
__label__Evidence	The drawback here is that people get carried away and be verbally aggressive and use foul language which doesn't go well with most of the readers who come to view the news and some of the healthy discussions in the comment section. But, all they find it few people engaging in a verbal war which is uncalled for.
__label__Position	You can moderate and that way delete hate speech. This won't get rid of freedom of speech but gets rid of discrimination etc https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech

__label__Evidence	Safe spaces stifle dialogue about controversial topics, such as race, gender and religion.
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.

__label__Evidence	judicial activism can give proper justice to those when the law isn't completely clear
__label__Evidence	out of control executive compensation raises the disparity between the haves and the have nots.
__label__Evidence	Zero-tolerance policies may seem unfair to the individual but bad and risky behavior at schools spreads faster than wildfire. Sometimes we must make an example of an individual for the greater good.
__label__Evidence	mandatory retirement is useful. creating a scheme in which old workers retired to give place to young workers permits to revive the economy and brings in fresh ideas and innovation
__label__Evidence	Child actors are forced to grow up way too fast, they are thrown into a world of drugs and sex at an early age. Kids should be away from all that until Hollywood is safe for them.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Position	i believe it is neccessary to name and shame users to use hate speech but unfortunately some will tend to use fake names and profiles
__label__Evidence	It helps people reflect on the news
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading is computer based and does not allow for any type of inspiration in trading.
__label__Evidence	A state that outlaws murder cannot then turn around and murder prisoners in the name of the law. It is perverse and unjust.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Evidence	Moderating will reduce hate speech and allow open discussion without personal, insulting opinions
__label__Position	The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is often used as a reason not to have readers comments. It seems that this is not a fair argument for eliminating readers comments because of the psychological phenomenon of "cognitive dissonance" - we automatically search for echo chambers in any context.
__label__Evidence	Agreed, and it would still allow opinions to be shared
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Evidence	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't adopt a zero tolerance policy in schools because it could cause kids to be wrongfully punished due to misunderstandings for example protecting themselves against a bully
__label__Evidence	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Evidence	Someone needs to be employed to regulate the chat
__label__Evidence	"EU is going to give a carbon credit for buildings that have been there for a long time" (Peter Cox)
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Evidence	ideas should be everyones not just one persons
__label__Evidence	But the perpetrator of said hate speech should also be informed as to what they did wrong. Sometimes people might do these things out of simple ignorance and others are just genuine and deliberate in their actions.
__label__Evidence	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Evidence	I do agree with you, but I think the people also should have a way of reporting comments.
__label__Evidence	"E.g. rebound effect." (Crispin Edwards)
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Evidence	we should not cancel pride parades because people should have the right to express what they want, and how they feel about a certain issue.
__label__Position	Removing the comment section will only create a bigger revolt and uprise from people that write hate speech, and it will move to another media outlets. So the problem should be treated not silenced it. It is the responsibility of newspapers websites to police hate speech in order to create a safe environment for an healthy discussion about a news article. Otherwise you are cutting short an experience that users might want to have. So by censoring all the comment section your make erverybody pay a price for something that they haven't done. Moderation is the key and should be done my the newspapers websites according to the values they have.
__label__Evidence	our debt has become so outrageous that an austerity program might be the only way out.
__label__Position	I agree that discussions should be moderated. But what happens when the moderators themselves are biased?
__label__Evidence	In theory, I really like this idea and feel it could minimise bullying and hate speech online.

__label__Evidence	voting is what drives our country and not voting means that the most preferred people do not get elected.

__label__Position	Immigrants should integrate through work
__label__Position	There should be a single EU policy.
__label__Evidence	The three-strikes law should be abolished and the punishment should always fit the crime so if the third crime is petty then they should have a minimal sentence or fine rather than prison terms.
__label__Evidence	missionary work can be a tool to help those in poverty by giving them food, clothing and a better quality of life.
__label__Evidence	there are already too many problems in the world that could use the resources more than space.
__label__Position	In as much as we can not let the spread of hate speech continue, closing the comment section is not the solution. The newspaper website should have the option for readers to be able to report comments that include hate speech and moderators should be appointed to check "users" that are violating the rules. There can be filters in place that remove posts that have some of the common hateful and derogatory phrases. outlining the rules and regulations for the website users can help
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Evidence	school uniforms make sure that each student starts out in an equal environment.
__label__Evidence	marijuana use harms cognitive function -- especially long-term memory -- and is particularly dangerous to the brain development of children and teens.
__label__Evidence	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	We need stricter and homogeneous environmental legislation across the EU
__label__Evidence	We should not subsidize journalism because it is not uniquely important to democracy compared to a host of other industries.
__label__Evidence	Data localization may result in government surveillance of its citizens.
__label__Position	People will become dumber.
__label__Evidence	We should aim to heat people :) not buildings (Cherry)
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Evidence	state sponsored killing should never be sanctioned because it leads down the path of extra-legal activities by the state whenever it can be justified
__label__Evidence	Agreed
__label__Evidence	embryonic stem cell research should be subsidized to speed up the rate that cures for serious illness are identified speedily.
__label__Evidence	libertarianism is a cruel and short-sighted view. it leads to greater inequality and an unempathetic society.
__label__Evidence	collectivism reduces productivity from individuals as they have no incentive to do better.
__label__Evidence	ideas should be available to anyone who wishes to persue them.
__label__Evidence	we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons to ensure a safe future for our children and for generations to come.
__label__Evidence	I agree
__label__Position	I don't think it's fair to eliminate comments from newspaper articles because the public is entitled to have their opinions heard. The best way to deal with hate speech is to moderate each comment before it is posted. Also the newspaper could ban accounts who engage in hate speech in the comments section. This moderation could be done through both human moderators and software to find trigger words signifying hate speech. It's important to democracy that citizens can have their say on the issues that affect their lives.
__label__Evidence	judicial activism must be supported by all means because judges knows law and they acting inside the law by judicial activism.
__label__Evidence	we should not ban targeted killing, it prevents mass military campaigns and minimises casualties
__label__Evidence	I think this is an invasion of privacy and the internet allows people to be the person they want to be and want to identify as - something they might not feel comfortable doing in real life.
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Evidence	zoos are cruel and contain wild animals in such tiny spaces when they need to run free so zoos should be abolished.
__label__Position	I stand by what I previously said and think that moderating the comment section is the best solution.
__label__Evidence	zoos are the only way we can preserve endangered species.

__label__Evidence	People with genuine hateful intentions will not change because of this.
__label__Evidence	Do you have some reservations about the EU? Go and protest your own government's decisions because it's the member states that decide what the EU can do and what it can't, unfortunately. The EU does not have an actual army - not because of bureaucrats but because our member states think they are better alone than united.

__label__Evidence	Yep, it needs to be a holistic approach. People have a right to speech but they need to be educated in how to express them kindly.
__label__Evidence	Every harpy screams 'more (black) women in power' until Candace Owens appears. Clever, charming black woman, but she is too clever, pro-freedom, and conservative, and that is the problem. So it isn't about women, it's mere greed and desire for power and influence.
__label__Evidence	Without bees, which are dying en masse, Europe’s existence is impossible. The problem is complex and it is about the influence of poisonous pesticides and other agricultural and industrial chemicals, as well as the influence of GSM technologies, which lead to overheating of the bee’s body, which falls under the negative impact of microwaves. Therefore, Europe must create a series of policies to help bees survive in the name of the surplus of European nations.
__label__Evidence	We should oppose collectivism as it forces people to be part of group mentality in order to achieve anything.
__label__Evidence	the church of scientology encourages people to cut themselves off from friends and family outside the church. this isolation is potentially damaging for children as it limits the opinions they have.

__label__Evidence	as many people's views don't fall in line with the two large parties, we can't say the current system is truly representative.
__label__Evidence	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Evidence	cosmetic surgery is unnecessary and dangerous.
__label__Evidence	if someone has no choice it is wrong to insist that they choose
__label__Position	Drawing the line between Freedom of speech and hate speech is critical, strict moderation and being able to hold people accountable will ensure hate speech is low. Moderators will just need to act impartially.
__label__Position	We should stop the European Commission’s Ideological bias toward migration.
__label__Position	AndreasS said that we should "educate young people on online politeness for want of a better word word have meaning and consequences in the real world and individuals have to take responsibility and not hide behind keyboards" which i believe to be a good point however there will still be times where an educated young person will still hide behind their keyboard and be polite, therefore i agree with his further comments to allow a subscription to ensure those can be named and held accountable however does this limit who has access to giving their comments if you have to buy a subscription and spend money to voice your views? I am for having subscriptions to voice an opinion which can be policed should negative comments be made but it should be made accessible to everyone. A differing opinion would be to completely remove comment sections as AlanU has said however to me this removes platforms for free speech which should be encouraged as long as it is not harming others, therefore in my opinion similarly to what DamianC has said about technologies to scan and detect offensive language. Personally I think a combination with human intelligence would be the best option. This is detailed in various areas online but mentioned here: https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2019/04/09/how-should-social-media-platforms-combat-misinformation-and-hate-speech/

__label__Evidence	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Evidence	we should not ban human cloning as we need to continue to work to the betterment of the health and welfare of the people.
__label__Evidence	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Evidence	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments

We need to negotiate Remigration deals with the 3rd countries to send their nationals back and we need to use Frontex to push back any migrants coming to our borders.
__label__Evidence	I agree as it would feel very weird to not have comment sections
__label__Evidence	Without change, the EU will be following the route of the USSR and other communist countries, who after 70 years of trying to build a social paradise ended in poverty and suppression.
__label__Evidence	Is there any evidence to suggest people prefer the comments?

__label__Evidence	there should be some leeway for pupils otherwise they will have no grounding for future life if all they know is what they can't do and cannot question it.
__label__Evidence	there is no hate speech
__label__Position	people should be taught how to be kind and the implications of how their words could affect other people.

__label__Evidence	True. At the end of the day, the publisher controls what is published
__label__Evidence	capital punishment is barbaric, what if an innocent person is killed under these laws, you cannot release them and make restitution, capital punishment makes authorities as guilty of crime as the criminals.
__label__Evidence	Sometimes being truthful can mean being harsh, but for the greater good.
__label__Evidence	I agree 100%. It's too easy to shut down all speech, just because someone gets offended by things that they do not agree with. This will only then attract the bullies and trolls who want to shout down anyone who isn't in lock step with their own narrow viewpoint.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.

__label__Evidence	Algorithims can be trained to understand what words to display and what not too.
__label__Evidence	Slows down discussion.
__label__Position	Whilst free speech should be allowed, social media companies have a responsibility to remove hate speech and to stop hate speech from being posted online, this can be via AI tools and algorithms that are designed to pickup on information posted that falls under the category of hate speech. Posts should be pre-checked first to confirm that they they don't fall under the banner of hate speech whilst still allowing users to express their opinions on a wide variety of topics. Also the newspapers have a duty not to inflame the situation further with their website articles as this is more likely to elicit a response from users that could be considered hate speech as users are more likely to respond to controversial articles and this could be seen as encouraging users to post hate speech.
__label__Evidence	Freedom of expression is important for ordinary people to express themselves; fight injustice and support marginalised groups. Regimes that depend on achieving and holding power in undemocratic ways see free expression as a threat and restrict or close down the internet.
__label__Evidence	As long as they use an accredited plastic surgeon, people should be able to do whatever they want with their bodies.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Evidence	I think people should have the right to comment but should do so respectfully.
__label__Position	I am not sure if we can fairly reduce hate speech. People can be mean and will find ways to spew their venom on others
__label__Evidence	the olympic games are necessary to promote healthy competition in the world and show the cultures of many countries.

__label__Evidence	the church of scientology indoctrinates people from an early age in a way that has lasting repercussions.
__label__Evidence	cosmetic surgery has too many risks of something going wrong compared to the benefit of looking more aesthetically pleasing.
__label__Evidence	I think that would be good
__label__Evidence	the three-strikes laws prevent rehabilitation for those who have committed minor offensives such as substance abuse treatment that can prevent future criminal acts.
__label__Position	Newspaper websites should have AI that auto flags bad comments
__label__Evidence	I opt without a doubt that the Balkan countries should be already accepted as EU members so that their membership status helps them evolve. We have great examples in Romania and Bulgaria, and going back to the eighties, to Spain and Portugal. Those countries started to truly develop when they joined the EU. Besides, as you stated, the Balkan countries have made huge efforts in the last years to approach the EU.
__label__Evidence	everyone should be given religious freedom so those who want to follow the church of scientology should be allowed to do so and, therefore, it should not be banned.
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Position	I think that by removing anonymous commenting, you may stop a lot of people commenting at all which is bad for free speech. Not everyone who wants to remain private will use hate speech. Definitely more moderation would be a good idea though.
__label__Evidence	wikipedia is a valuable source of information in all things and would be missed if it were not able to continue due to lack of support
__label__Position	Removing the comment facility in no way infringes free speech. The content providers, newspapers, are at liberty to provide discussion space or not as they see fit. The use of a moderator might be useful but this seems a great investment of time to little effect. There are obviously those who enjoy using comment spaces to express extreme and unthought out opinions as well as to insert hate speech. Perhaps only those who have subscribed to a news source should be allowed to comment.
__label__Evidence	fast food is the main culprit for our current obesity epidemic. we need to get rid of it to restore our health in the future.
__label__Position	I think it'll be hard to do so, because everyone has the right to freedom of speech, but unless the comments brings acts of violence on people then it must be deleted
__label__Evidence	We should support collectivism because it encourages people to take responsibility for their community, which eases the burden on the state.
__label__Evidence	libertarianism is wrong and will deploy mess and confuse to our society.
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Evidence	space exploration is too costly and there aren't enough tangible benefits to justify subsidization
__label__Position	Maybe online newspapers can invest in text mining, where if hate speech is detected, the comment will not go through. Or, in the comments section, there could be a greyed message in the background that states a non-tolerance to hate speech.
__label__Evidence	cosmetic surgery is risky in that it can cause adverse affects.
__label__Evidence	we should not subsidize embryonic stem cell research because it can harm life of a person once it is not done successfully
__label__Evidence	by the time people are at executive level they have worked long and hard and deserved to be recompensed for their work and ideas at a fair level.
__label__Evidence	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Evidence	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Evidence	India has a huge trade deficit with China. For the year 2017-18, India's imports from China are worth $76.2 billion dollars, whereas India's exports to China are worth $33 billion dollars. So, there is a need to reduce this trade deficit.
__label__Evidence	I think it is the responsibility of the websites to moderate any hatefull comments. You can agree and disagree with somthing without hate.
__label__Evidence	Hate speech is already defined in law in many countries. As its already a criminal offence , the existing legislation provides the definition of hate speech, and blueprint to follow.
__label__Evidence	The whole point of comment sections is so that people can provide their opinion on what they've seen/read, stopping this only minimizes debate and being able to view differing opinions. This then leads to break off groups choosing to use other platforms and thus having platforms with polar opinions which can be dangerous as people could be exposed to only one viewpoint

__label__Position	The EU must take the lead for the Middle East.
__label__Evidence	i agree, it is a form of violence
__label__Evidence	fast food is unhealthy, cheap and easy to find and it needs to be banned
__label__Evidence	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Position	i feel it definitely stifles peopls opinions. Everyone should be given the freedom to state their stance on a particular opinion of theirs. This is called censoring.
__label__Evidence	the term safe spaces should not be used as it marginalizes all other space as insecure
__label__Evidence	whaling is humane and cruel and should be banned, especially with a dwindling whale population.
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	the opinion should be checked before publishing
__label__Position	A mass ban on certain words should be the first step and the be moderated by the users through a report system. This will eliminate the need for a dedicated moderator and instead be self governed. The final action can be decided by the newspaper which, for the most part should be a quick procedure.
__label__Evidence	a multi-party system could lead to more situations where a majority is not reached. this means that it could be harder to push policies through.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars are not trustable in every aspect of safety. we can't trust the robots and their ability to react in such a situation which humans will react in according of situation.

__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Position	Some words could be put in the software and removed or censored when detected. This is not too hard to be done and will not eliminate the freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	We should not end mandatory retirement because it opens up positions for young people who otherwise could never begin their career.
__label__Position	There should be a system of other contributors being able to flag potential hare speech and a way to vote on whether the comment was hate speech, enabling a balanced consensus to be achieved.
__label__Evidence	judicial activism may lead to "despotic behavior", therefore we should avoid it.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Evidence	legalizing the organ trade would make the organs to expensive to all those on need, making them available to only the wealthiest of patients.
__label__Evidence	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Evidence	due to the obligations of the students it is sometimes difficult to get a job, we must help them pay their loans so that they do not leave school
__label__Evidence	legalizing recreational marijuana will add billions to the economy, create hundreds of thousands of jobs, and save limited police resources
__label__Evidence	without ip rights, the market would be awash with cheap imitations
__label__Evidence	We really are in a high tech age and seem to have the ability to create all sorts of platforms, so we should be able to help moderate them via AI and similar.
__label__Evidence	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Evidence	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Evidence	we need to do away with intellectual property rights so it doesn't slow down innovation
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Evidence	school prayer should be viewed as espousing human ideals of love and tolerance, free from tethering to one particular religion, and is such is a valuable message to be promoting.
__label__Position	Good point. If people had to register their real identity, they would be less inclined to engage in hate speech.
__label__Evidence	gender-neutral language should be adopted so that society can progress and advance. does it really matter if you are a man or woman anymore? it shouldn't.
__label__Evidence	I agree that AI moderators offer an ideal solution. I think it's worth considering that having human moderators would mean that there are individuals who have to read through hate speech regularly. This research article provides more detail on this point: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/09/220916112424.htm
__label__Evidence	The EU cannot be heaven for the entire World. The reality requires that refugees must be stopped at the border and receive only temporary shelter. The number is simply too big to give anyone: free housing, free living, free education, free medicare, and a free pension. Anybody arguing else is completely out of touch with reality.
__label__Position	I think that keeping an open space for discussion is vital and needed. Strick and easy to understand rules should be there and a group of moderators implementing them as well. We should do more about educating on media ethics, keeping freedom of expression should be combined with counteracting hate speech messages.
__label__Evidence	we should adopt an austerity regime because it would help to reduce unnecessary spending
__label__Evidence	Europe is full and cannot accept more illegal migrants. Those persons must be sent back and have to ask for approval from their state of origin.

__label__Evidence	children are humans too and with their consent and their parent's consent, should be allowed to work
__label__Position	You need stricter standards with moderators who act quickly to censor and analyse comments to remove those which cross boundaries.
__label__Evidence	Hate speech should not be taken as a form of free speech
__label__Position	In order for effective moderation to occur, some kind of consensus or clearly reachable policy on what constitutes hate speech (including dogwhistling, which may be less clear to a lay viewer) would need to be in place. This might require too much buy-in from commenters, but is necessary if anything can be consistently enforced.
__label__Evidence	newspapers can turn off the comment section, leaving people with their own concerns and comments
__label__Evidence	Legalizing cannabis would allow the authorities to control the quality and strength of the product making it safer to use and could also collect tax from the sale.

__label__Position	Climate change is anyways is a hoax! 31,000 scientists reject global warming and say "no convincing evidence" that humans can or will cause global warming
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards.

__label__Position	create a team of people that can look for and remove the hate speech and leave all other respectful arguments to make the comment section diverse.
__label__Evidence	I agree everyone should be able to express their point of view
__label__Evidence	I disagree with this to an extent, in order to have an open debate, both sides would have to be coming at the issue from a similarly open minded position, which realistically is not going to happen.
__label__Evidence	targeted killing should not be banned as the government has the intelligence and knowledge to knowingly destroy a threat without destruction of many persons or communities.
__label__Evidence	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Evidence	I agree
__label__Evidence	organs are expensive, and a legal trade can allow for someone in desperate need to get an organ without money or wait times.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Evidence	targeted killings could allow governments to take out high-profile targets before they can cause mass destruction.
__label__Evidence	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Evidence	People are willing to volunteer change in relation to involuntary inflicted changes, such as technology, economy, and climate. With this in mind, I hope a European Constitution will be long-lasting and help the people. We have to react to the circumstances and start fast.

__label__Evidence	we are exploiting the youth purely for entertainment
__label__Position	This comment was removed because it broke the hate speech policy of this webstie.
__label__Evidence	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Evidence	true, but maybe they can remove anonymity so that everyone can be accountable for what they say.
__label__Evidence	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Evidence	Accepting refugees escaping from death situations is surely an act of humanity. Rohingya people have been treated brutally by the Burmese government due to racism. Being a neighboring country, we should be accepting those people who are in deep distress.
__label__Evidence	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Evidence	'We most definitely do not need a wider definition of 'gender-based' anything. 'Gender' is a politicized left-wing concept. I certainly encourage wider protection from violence against women and girls. That should most definitely include protection from the violence and coercion young women face from 'trans' activists. We also want nothing to do with 'intersectionality' which is a neo-Marxist concept of overlapping oppressions. No one is being oppressed in Europe.
__label__Evidence	we protect freedom of religion in our country. even if we do not agree with their principles, we must respect their rights to their beliefs
__label__Position	The EU should recognize Taiwan as an independent sovereign state
__label__Evidence	we should abolish the olympic games because the money they spend could be used for better things like medical research

__label__Position	Head speech acan also have a very negative impact on people mental health too. the newspapers can make people look really bad and not write the correct information. we all remember how much the media contributed to Caroline Flack. Im NHS staff, all the stuff that was said about us during COVID. most was ok but you look at papers now and read comments about us now, than 2yrs ago when we were heros. its so depressing
__label__Evidence	we should not oppose collectivism because everyone should work together.
__label__Evidence	it would help to get organs faster for the people that need them
__label__Evidence	fast food has brought so much health damage to our society that control of this type of food is necessary
__label__Evidence	capital punishment is a way to deter heinous crimes.
__label__Evidence	This does not remove comments altogether
__label__Position	Research in computer science addresses phenomena, such as toxic comments (van Aken et al., 2018), offensive language (Chen et al., 2012), abusive speech (Nobata et al., 2016), or profanity (Sood et al., 2012). Hate speech is frequently – but not always – used as a synonym. Equating hate speech with offensive language is insofar problematic as a comment can be offensive without referring to a target group. When scholars consider this group reference in their definitions, they often concentrate on explicit racist terms or consider other characteristics (e.g., religion or sexual orientation) that are used to stigmatize groups (e.g., Davidson et al., 2017; ElSherief et al., 2018; Silva et al., 2016). But researchers who use ethnic slur lists seldom distinguish between user-generated communication addressing individuals or generalizing derogatory speech to a whole social group. The main goal of computer scientific research is the automatic detection of hate speech in large quantities of data. To classify hate speech, one can choose a deductive approach, using dictionaries consisting of lists of ethnic slurs or category-specific swearwords. An issue regarding these keyword-based approaches is the nature of language. It is never static, the degree of formality and tone changes depending on the platform where user-generated content is published. Additionally, users adapt their writing or choice of words quickly to avoid censorship. (https://www.cairn.info/revue-questions-de-communication-2020-2-page-529.htm)
__label__Evidence	State subsidies for journalism will make journals financially dependent on the government, which will allow the government to influence what news gets reported and how the reporting is done.

__label__Evidence	three-strikes laws act as a very effective deterrent to crime, and this zero tolerance approach has been been responsible for making cities far safer.
__label__Evidence	his is the issue in politics and public sector policy making. No objectives are to be pursued. No problems to be solved. I guess it is the nature of the beast. Balancing conflicting interests.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Evidence	Complex problems are faced by deepening study, not by pretending they don't exist.
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Evidence	we should continue to support pride parades as every single group has the right to celebrate their group in any fashion they wish as long as it does not hurt others.

__label__Position	I think there should be a comment section so that writers know what the readers like and dislike but hate speech should be fully eliminated and any users using hate speech should be blocked for a period of time.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Evidence	we should ban private military companies because war for hire is a bad practice, a dangerous one.
__label__Evidence	cannabis has many dangerous side effects, including hallucinations and respiratory issues.
__label__Evidence	prostitution is an inhuman, immoral and dangerous act
__label__Position	Research shows that letting comments proliferate with little oversight is a “dangerous recipe,” Andincivility and negative comments can have a long-term impact. Certain commenting software use algorithms meant to flag problematic comments, but machines can only do so much. Should newspapers really be spending already depleted resources on monitoring comments?
__label__Position	This is possible, in fact awareness should be brought to this topic.
__label__Evidence	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Evidence	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Evidence	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Evidence	It is truly a pity that many people lost many of their rights overnight, one year ago. It is actually a pity that the UK even made such a decision. Brexit was the decision of generally uninformed or misinformed people who can't be blamed for it. Especially the ones that actually voted to remain or the ones that didn't get to vote at all. The truth is that the UK was always sort of the 'black sheep' in the EU. Even historically, the UK was often somewhat 'detached' from European politics and issues.
__label__Evidence	government is needed. it provides the institutions that can better serve the public. this can be done through good taxation policy and good programs.
__label__Evidence	If nuclear weapons exist there will always be a risk of escalation to all out nuclear war which would literally destroy the world, so we must fight to abolish them.
__label__Evidence	missionary work has other benefits beyond spreading religion, it makes a huge impact on small communities in poor countries that need help.
__label__Evidence	gender neutral language is a way to be more sensitive and politically correct in a modern society with a plurality of genders
__label__Evidence	We should not cancel pride parades simply due to freedom of expression, any group can express themselves.
__label__Evidence	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Evidence	This is true which is why I also suggested introducing a reporting feature so that, in cases where hate speech may not automatically be detected, people would still be able to raise a concern about the comment.
__label__Evidence	Free speech should be entouraged but newspapers should have more responsibility to moderate
__label__Evidence	pride parades are disruptive and cause chaos in towns where they are held.
__label__Evidence	Keeping and bearing arms is dangerous because accidents happen and people could die needlessly.
__label__Evidence	schools already have systems and hierarchies, there is no need to employ further policies.

__label__Evidence	safe spaces are important for those who do not feel included or feel threatened
__label__Evidence	Telemarketing is an excellent tool if used sensitively and with caution

__label__Evidence	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Evidence	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Evidence	legalizing prostitution promotes the sex trafficking industry
__label__Evidence	That said, I'd agree that everyone should be able to express their opinions.....as long as they are public and the accounts are transparent, without the users hiding behind anonymous accounts. If they do that, then consequences can occur.
__label__Evidence	nobody has the right to take another person's life no matter how evil that person may be.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	if telemarketing was banned thousands of people would lose their jobs and many businesses would go bankrupt.
__label__Evidence	Technology may increase to where it can be - like developing time travel.
__label__Evidence	we need the three strikes as a deterrent
__label__Evidence	cosmetic surgery teaches our daughters that they need to look perfect and never age.
__label__Position	We do not want immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__Evidence	missionary work is beneficial for those receiving aid.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Position	Comments can be vetted and reviewed for key words that might be labelled as hate speech.
__label__Evidence	telemarking is keeping jobs available for some
__label__Evidence	NOT. To "sort" climate change we need to do a LOT, and one of those absolutely mandatory requirement is to use clean energy - no matter the cost
__label__Evidence	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Evidence	there is too much gun violence, and too many innocent people are dying.
__label__Evidence	providing child actors are still taught school subjects and that they are given time to be children then it is good for them and the money earned will give them freedom as adults to do whatever they want
__label__Evidence	organ trade would help save thousands of lives every year.
__label__Evidence	Missionary work can sometimes do more harm than good - for example, if religious missionaries discourage the use of condoms in a place where HIV is the main cause of death.
__label__Evidence	strict capital punishment brings justice and closure to the victim's family
__label__Evidence	it is really just another name for assassination
__label__Evidence	targeted killing allows groups and governments to remove their enemies and terrorists without the need for a full scale war, this will save lives and must be beneficial.
__label__Evidence	children provide unique storytelling opportunities for movies and should not be banned as long as they are properly raised and cared for.
__label__Evidence	women are going to sell their bodies, so why not make it legal so they can do it properly, pay taxes on their income and hopefully stay clean.
__label__Evidence	missionaries basically bribe the poor to change to their religion.
__label__Evidence	safe spaces can help those hurting from abuse, anger, etc to feel protected
__label__Evidence	cannabis use leads to the use of other drugs.
__label__Evidence	Think it is important to some extent to maintain free speech without heavy moderation from these newspapers who may be trying to sway opinions a certain way.
__label__Evidence	Nuclear weapon has lost it's deterrence after the cold war, and so it's not usefull anymore
__label__Position	As I said before, using the AI is a good option for filtering comments. According to this article https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0163443720957562, moderators have difficulties separating "uncivil speech" so I think we need to use AI to filter comments.
__label__Evidence	there are many different types of religion, so children should not be forced to pray to a region that they do not follow,
__label__Evidence	Complex problems are faced by deepening study, not by pretending they don't exist.
__label__Evidence	i also agree with lawrenceM as i believe the filters need to be improved and if they arent there, then they need to be made,
__label__Evidence	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Position	No one is going to give significant personal data or information, or if they do it will false information. I think all comments should be moderated all the time, and posts removed if they contain harmful or damaging content.
__label__Evidence	fast food has become extremely unhealthy and contributing to nation's obesity crisis.
__label__Evidence	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Evidence	I agree, because not all comments will be hate speech, some are positive.
__label__Position	but still people are bias, especially when it comes to serious matter/ or personal matter
__label__Evidence	True people should be able to express their opinions
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	I dont agree with this, if hate speech is causing societal issues it should be talk about in the news
__label__Evidence	It's bad enough having to take out a student loan in the first place, but even more students from poorer backgrounds will be reluctant to go into higher education if their student loans aren't subsidized.
__label__Position	People should be allowed to say what they want. Other people can disagree - they should not allow themselves to be angered by opinions with which they disagree.
__label__Evidence	the last thing we need to promote to minors in this modern world is changing your appearance to meet societal beauty norms.
__label__Evidence	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Evidence	helping our government and our country is mandatory for all of us and austerity regime must be adopted.
__label__Evidence	human cloning can aid in research for medical issues as well as preserving the continuation of humankind.
__label__Evidence	human cloning is simply another avenue of science to explore, and it is vital to push back the boundaries in order to open up possible potential cures for disease and medical issues.
__label__Evidence	collectivism can erode personal freedoms in a way that is irreversible
__label__Evidence	By our actions many species have been made extinct and the chemistry of the gasses that make up our atmosphere have been altered.Climate change caused extinctions are permanent, it follows therefore we cannot wind back the clock.
__label__Evidence	Absolutely agree,and public opinion seems to favour this approach.
__label__Position	Here are reasons why I agree with the position of having comments being moderated,it benefits everyone and prevents harmful or hateful speech.
__label__Evidence	We need an investment policy that creates decent jobs and fosters labor rights and especially Trade Unions around the globe. There can not be a sustainable world without collective representation of workers/employees by free Trade Unions.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Evidence	pride parades do the exact opposite of what they're meant to. instead of making themselves part of the community, they're making themselves stand apart
__label__Evidence	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Evidence	many zoos are involved in conservation projects- without them animals would go extinct
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Evidence	telemarketing is a perfectly valid marketing approach, and is a primary driver of economic activity.
__label__Evidence	missionary work helps many people who are in distress
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Position	I do agree that Hate Speeh can be an issue. Removing the ability to make comments for readers would stop. Maybe some form of vetting comments prior to publishing would help the situation.
__label__Evidence	cannabis is a hallucinogenic product that can harm a persons memory, lower their inhibitions and cause a person to make dangerous choices and is addictive. all of these behaviors can be destructive.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars would help the elderly.
__label__Position	We are simply not prepared to give up on our modern lifestyle to achieve this. Nobody wants to give up his cheap flight to exotic destinations, his big petrol car, cheap electricity, ...
__label__Position	It already happens on platforms like YouTube and Instagram so it's definitely possible for article sites.
__label__Evidence	The future belongs to technology. Cryptocurrencies make peer-to-peer financial transactions a lot easier. This currency can be sent from any part of the world to any part of the world. Hence there will be no struggle of exchanging currencies like Dollars for the Rupee etc. While traveling the world, there will no hurdle of exchanging our currencies with local currencies.
__label__Evidence	targeted killing is a tool that allows the military to accomplish their objectives.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Evidence	Legalizing prostitution will help destigmatize sex in society more broadly and allow people to feel individually empowered.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Evidence	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments

__label__Evidence	economic sanctions hurt poorer citizens
__label__Position	once news is exposed to the internet, everyone has access to it, and right to comment any how they feel about the news, but hate speech is very unacceptable, if you find the news very uncomfortable, just skip the site and find news that suits your needs.
__label__Evidence	gender-neutral pronouns won't catch on, it is confusing to try and add a new pronoun to the lexicon when there are existing solutions already in place.
__label__Evidence	we should make sex selection legal. it will lead to more freedom regarding choices of family building. a couple could choose to have a boy and a girl without just hoping for that scenario
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Evidence	A fair, sustainable, and open Europe benefits everyone. Our common future demands actions to put human rights, solidarity, and social justice on top of the agenda.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.

__label__Evidence	uniforms remove some types of peer pressure surrounding students' appearance.
__label__Evidence	I agree
__label__Evidence	you admitted that this 'ain't true'. Although hate comments may not initially cause any physical harm, the psychological damage caused by hate comments is bad enough and can eventually lead to physical damage too.

__label__Evidence	voting should be a choice for every person
__label__Evidence	The emphasis on negative stereotypes towards migrants comes mostly from people who don't know Africans or other migrants or refugees.
__label__Evidence	Using moderators and flagging can be abused to prevent valid comments. If the moderator doesn't like what you have written, or if there are several users who doesn't like you on the platform, they can abuse the flagging. Just look at YouTube and how many abuse the flagging to get rid of a channel or person who they don't agree with and who have strong opinions you don't agree with.
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading gives people an unfair speed advantage over the rest of the field.
__label__Evidence	I believe thats an accurate solution

__label__Position	Cattle slaughter should be banned
__label__Evidence	people should be allowed to eat what they want
__label__Position	This is an interesting point - I wonder if some websites already use AI to moderate user comments and posts. I think AI could be trained to recognise hate speech, although it would have to be tested first as it could censor too much.
__label__Evidence	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Evidence	a well-executed targeted killing is an important tool to prevent war and attacks and there's no reason to ban them.
__label__Evidence	This is a measured, moderate response which looks to preserve the best of both worlds.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Evidence	there are other avenues of stem cell research that do not require the highly contentious and offensive use of embryonic cells
__label__Evidence	we should not prohibit school prayer because it would violate rights some religions
__label__Evidence	the world of acting is a high pressure, extremely stressful place and children should be protected from it.
__label__Evidence	To add to my previous comment about having clear and established rules I refer to https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/article-1388145/House-Rules.html The daily mail is well known for having a very open and sometimes contentious comment section. By having clear rules and removing posts that break rules and not based on opinion or thought. You can allow people to say controversial things as long as they stay within some boundaries

__label__Evidence	everyone needs a place where they feel safe
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Evidence	I disagree, comment sections allow the public to engage with the news and find people similar to them
__label__Evidence	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Evidence	Telemarketing is a waste of time for all parties involved and rarely results in a sale for the company doing the telemarketing and provides a disturbance in the lives of those who are called
__label__Evidence	a multi-party system offers too many options and decreases the election voting for one candidate, spreading out the votes over too many options.
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Evidence	I think this is a good solution for the problem. People will always find a way around it but it will eliminate at least some hateful comments.

__label__Evidence	i agree with this
__label__Evidence	The three-strikes law is a deterrent against crime.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__Evidence	We need to agree that people who do not respect our immigration law are detained in centers for repatriation.

__label__Evidence	I agree that moderators should be responsible for what is posted to avoid hate speech and offensive comments.
__label__Position	I strongly believe that removing the readers' comment space will be depriving readers of expressing themselves, hence stopping freedom of speech. Imagine if you saw something about yourself in the newspaper that was totally incorrect, would you let that slide? I want to be able to comment on everyday things but I'm not for hate speech. That means that there needs to be some monitoring that has to be made.
__label__Evidence	if someone can still work they should be allowed. it will cause less strain on social security.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Evidence	I think the main things to ensure are: - Taking away the option for anonymous accounts - Having a screening process - Giving users the ability to flag comments they think are innapropriate
__label__Position	There are other ways to reduce or block hateful comments without having to eliminate comment section.
__label__Evidence	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Evidence	I agree with you on this, it's helping someone with a job, and it protects the person in the article from hate speech.

__label__Evidence	funding comes with overt or covert strings attached, certain criticisms of the government would vanish
__label__Evidence	fast food is leading to an obesity epidemic and a health crisis.
__label__Evidence	Totally agree with this and hopefully most rational people would.
__label__Evidence	targeted killing can help remove terrorist and other similar threats without having to involve large numbers of people. targeted killing can reduce casualties and provide a better outcome than all out war.
__label__Evidence	zoos are helping in many ways the animals that are going extinct and that will not make it in the wild so they should not be abolished.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Evidence	executive pay is out of control. when an executive can earn the same in a week as a manual worker earns in a year, then something is wrong.
__label__Position	The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is often used as a reason not to have readers comments. It seems that this is not a fair argument for eliminating readers comments because of the psychological phenomenon of "cognitive dissonance" - we automatically search for echo chambers in any context.
__label__Evidence	atheists are much more likely to care about the environment
__label__Evidence	we need better representation of all people. the two party system is broken and only represents a select few.
__label__Evidence	we should abolish intellectual property rights as the law is very complex and it is very easy to infringe copyright.
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't subsidize wikipedia because pages on wikipedia is user created and isn't always accurate
__label__Evidence	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Evidence	intellectual property rights should be abolished as an individual's thoughts or creative abilities are their own and should not be controlled or owned by a company.
__label__Position	I support the decision of newspapers to remove the comments section. They should have letters pages like theiur hard copy versions where a letters editor decides what should be published.
__label__Position	Exactly and we can all learn from each other especially coming from different countries
__label__Position	I am for people being allowed to post their opinions in a comment section as long as it is moderated correctly & fairly.

__label__Evidence	economic sanctions do nothing to those in power and ruin the lives of ordinary citizens instead.
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Evidence	safe spaces may be the intention but people do not necessarily adhere to such titles and their would be no differentiation of a safe space vs. negative.
__label__Evidence	Indigenous Europeans have no obligation to take in any more migrants, and neither do they want to. This is being forced on us.
__label__Position	We cannot reduce hate speech because in as much as it is hate speech, it is still speech which everyone has a right of, if everyone respected one another we would not have this problem, having speech never created to much freedom, but losing respect for someone else is where the problem begins .
__label__Evidence	There should be a right to free speech and peoples views

__label__Evidence	whaling provides food and other resourses for people that are poor
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment

__label__Evidence	it is an interesting concept that even though it hasn't caused much impact yet could possibly be a happy medium between the two existing parties and should be considered.
__label__Evidence	The problem is some form of censorship would be required for writers if the definition of "hate speech" isn't universally agreed. Perhaps a trigger warning for readers of a sensitive disposition could be given at the start of an article. Different countries have different laws or understandings of hate speech. Will comments from different countries have to be blocked?
__label__Evidence	Many false domestic violence cases are being reported in India. Girl can drag their in-laws to court, but the same is not true with a boy. In many domestic violence cases, in-laws didn't even stay with couple, but are booked for 'influencing' the boy. Do girl's parents not 'influence' her? And the saddest thing is that girl can complain against her sister-in-law and sister-in-law's husband too under domestic violence, even if they are not staying at her place. Women can be as cruel as men in harassing their life partner.
__label__Evidence	CO2 reaches historic levels everyday.When it is control the climate change returned normal condition.Unless future will be in worst condition.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	I understand the offer for newspaper websites to not have a comments section as it would mean that there is absolutely no chance for hate speech, using AI is a good suggestion to automatically remove certain words but how can this ensure all hate comments are removed. Perhaps AI monitoring could be used and then have people to also check them

__label__Evidence	zoos are bad for wild animals that need to live free
__label__Evidence	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Evidence	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't abolish the right to keep and bear arms because it can help stop mass shootings if everyone has a gun
__label__Evidence	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Evidence	so many people are getting elective surgery and having complications later.
__label__Evidence	children have a right to bodily autonomy just like adults, and banning cosmetic surgery is a violation of this freedom of expression.
__label__Evidence	we should ban the church of scientology as many ex-members report manipulation and bullying and it has been reported to be a cult which has seperated families.
__label__Position	I think it's a bit of a lost cause. People will put hate speech in. The only way to stop it, I think is to not allow comments to be made. Technically, that's what happens with print versions of newspapers. We just read the article. Anyone who wants to express an opinion can write a letter to the editor. (Who would screen out hate stuff!). But, we live in an online world. So people expect to be able to have their say. And people probably wouldn't subscribe if they can't interact on an online service. Anyway, I do think people having verified accounts might help. Need to stop the "anonymous" profiles - the coward's castle types.
__label__Evidence	Celebrities are a massive victim of hate speech allowing people the freedom of commenting what they want is harmful. A lot of the time articles will use these comments in other articles to back up negative opinions about others
__label__Position	A good starting point would be to ensure comments aren't anonymous, so that people think more carefully about what they write.
__label__Position	The European Union should visible on the facades of the embassies and consulates of European countries.
__label__Evidence	collectivism is a harmful ideology that puts members of groups against each other.
__label__Position	The question is? Is hate speech not part of free speech? I think people should be left to express themselves however they feel is appropriate as long as they are not breaking an laws
__label__Evidence	gun ownership is a personal right and a form of personal protection in an ever-increasingly hostile and dangerous world.
__label__Evidence	supporting collectivism is important because groups value is most important in the society which we live today.
__label__Position	Poor argument
__label__Evidence	embryonic stem cell research has the potential to help cure some of the most devastating diseases
__label__Position	Human spoiled the nature to a great extent and they have to face the consequences and should avoid doing more harm to the environment any further.
__label__Evidence	the three-strikes law should be abolished. each convicted crime should be punished individually. it isn't right to judge a person solely on their criminal history.
__label__Evidence	I disagree. I think other readers of hate speech could be influenced by it making the issue spread even further. You can share your opinions without using hate speech and with a balanced approach so it should be removed.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	Yes, you can have your own opinion but that doesnt mean you have the right to spread hate.
__label__Position	After going through all the other comments ,my opinion on the topic has not changed. Newspaper Websites are where people should get the news from ONLY, not write their opinions. They can go express their opinion else where about what they have read , not on the website.
__label__Evidence	Reality shows act like a launchpad for children into the film industry. Some of the present singers, choreographers are made into the movies through reality shows for children.
__label__Evidence	When nuclear weapons exist in one place, they are always at risk of proliferating to the most dangerous of regimes.
__label__Position	We can also do this through letting moderators know how it feels to be victim to hate speech online, through getting hate speech victims to describe what it feels like, so moderators are more precise with their moderation!
__label__Position	State that the editor is free to print or not print any comments, and his/hers is the final decision.
__label__Position	i think one can filter the comment so that only the comment that show love are seen by people
__label__Evidence	Many developed countries are spending so much money to protect their borders, but are not spending any money for protecting the lives of refugees. More funding is required to protect refugees.
__label__Evidence	pride parades are offensive to a lot of people
__label__Position	i believe what should be prioritized is the permanent removal of the comment section. i also believe that people do not need to learn further about hate speech. people already know which comments are harmful and which comments are not harmful which is why they keep throwing those comments every chance they get. i stand with the take of eliminating the platform to comment and that will solve the solution. or the comment section should have moderators who can approve comments before they are posted.
__label__Evidence	it could help reduce rape and sexual abuse of people and prostitutes and it could then be regulated.
__label__Evidence	If there are language problems, we need to work on national integration systems, e.g. in France where English is being thought in French. language.
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions

__label__Evidence	missionary work disrupts an indigenous culture's natural development.
__label__Evidence	What does legal migration look like? People can not ask for asylum at an Embassy or Consulate. So people actually have to come to the EU and enter the EU if they want to ask for asylum in the EU. This has caused inhumane and dangerous circumstances as we see in the Mediterranean Sea.

__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading is fast and efficient and better able to deal with data
__label__Position	I believe removing the comment section is not a solution and that it actually encourages hate speech
__label__Evidence	Movie stars of Bollywood often launch their children with much ease in the industry. Such acts serve as the roots of the debate for nepotism. This kind of act has been going on since ages. Hence, nepotism evidently exists in Bollywood.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Evidence	an austerity regime would eliminate the national debt by directing money to where it really needs to go.
__label__Evidence	they laws don't stop crime, they just punish people harder.
__label__Evidence	Not all scientists input is put into the public eye and if a scientist is against the propaganda than they just eliminate him from being heard

__label__Evidence	we shouldn't ban targeted killing because it can help find terrorists and stop attacks from happening.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Evidence	But "personal liberty" can't be absolute: one person's liberty should not force another person into hiding. Also, the whole "state control" meme seems to be disingenous: in times of great crisis the state not only may but MUST intervene for the safety and security of all. That is the core reason for the state to exist.
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading is unfair and used to disrupt the real economy
__label__Evidence	even if guns fall into the wrong hands, law abiding citizens should be allowed to protect themselves in whichever manner they feel safest with.

__label__Evidence	gender selection is essentially playing god.
__label__Position	The worst thing we could do would be to continue to do nothing. That's what's gotten us into this mess in the first place. Technology is evolving rapidly; think of all the changes and advancements that have been made in the recent past. Perhaps a solution is around the corner and we just don't know what it is yet. We cannot give up.

__label__Evidence	mandatory retirement allows for new people to saturate the workforce and the older generation to relax. this is a good thing.
__label__Evidence	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Position	We should adopt gender-neutral language
__label__Evidence	austerity makes times tougher for everyone.
__label__Evidence	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Evidence	subsidizing everything a person does can drain the pocket overtime.
__label__Evidence	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Evidence	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Evidence	wikipedia often provides biased, inaccurate information due to lax editing policies and procedures.
__label__Evidence	The technology developed for space exploration has also had uses in regular life -- subsidizing space exploration would also have positive trickle down effects.
__label__Evidence	the olympics bring people together and form fun rivalries between countries, all vying for a top spot among the world's athletes
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Evidence	I agree
__label__Evidence	we should do because it may be able to cure diseases we never thought possible, and help people have babies that might of been infertile.
__label__Evidence	can algorithms be trusted
__label__Position	I agree that challenging hate speech is important and can see how the arguments for non-moderated but automated filtering systems discussed earlier might seem to make sense, on the surface but, if anything, the failure of these systems across the web to filter out hate speech is the reason human moderation is necessary fro any comments section, especially for a newspaper, where people often pay more attention to the comments than the contents.
__label__Evidence	they are a waste of money, building hype for a short event. money will be better spent elsewhere
__label__Evidence	there are other ways to channel student aid that is not subsidizing loans
__label__Position	Short answer: you can't. 'Hate speech' is a vague term, and what one person considers 'hate speech' might not be the same as someone else's.
__label__Evidence	atheism will destroy the world by unleashing godless people running the government with no morals or ethics and should not be adopted.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Evidence	we should ban the church of scientology because scientologists become hostile toward anything that is critical toward the religion
__label__Evidence	Recidivism rates are highly unlikely to go down after a third crime; it is therefore just to remove this person from society.
__label__Evidence	we should ban cosmetic surgery for minors because it is not necessary and as an individual matures they may not be a need for this procedure.
__label__Evidence	Hate speech can unfortunetely bean opinion base within this modern world. Being oversentativie to certain comments can pottentially reduce freedom of speech.
__label__Position	we can do that by having strict rules on language and hate speech where one can be blocked from commenting or their comments gets removed if there is any negativity
__label__Position	Hate speech is not a criticsm and should be avoided
__label__Evidence	Entering the EU without a permit automatically excludes a person from any right to receive asylum.
__label__Position	Educate people that hate speech can lower a person's self esteem
__label__Evidence	Migration has totally gotten out of control. The EU refuses to see the magnitude of it. Hundreds of millions like to migrate. All people without the right language and fitting education. The massive numbers of immigrants threaten the existence of EU societies, through crime, poverty, and housing shortage.
__label__Evidence	it would lead to more crimes and trouble
__label__Evidence	Marvelous to see this idea of halting immigration receive the most endorsements on the migration topic. This is really not going according to plan for the globalists!
__label__Evidence	The integration of Eastern Europe should be a priority. Most of them are pretty small countries so they would not constitute an economic burden if that is what all is about. Should we wait for those countries to 'be prepared, politically and economically, or just the other way around, we should integrate them already, so that EU membership boosts their development? They are as much Europeans as we are.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Evidence	the open source nature of wikipedia means anyone can add gibberish and falsehood in its contents thereby making it unreliable.
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Evidence	wikipedia can form biased opinions on topics or misinform the general public and therefore should not be subsidized
__label__Evidence	Nuclear weapons do not only cause immediate devastation, but also long term radiation poisoning that can result in cancers and other diseases for any survivors of a nuclear blast, which is cruel and unacceptable.
__label__Evidence	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Evidence	if we legalize the organ trade we will save lives, by ensuring that more people who need an organ transplant actually get one.
__label__Evidence	need to have a full time moderator
__label__Position	the comment section should be set in a way that filters certain words that promote hate speech
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Evidence	Also it's not about restricting any form of hate speech, we also need to be reminded that our opinions can't be the only right one. Hate speech is hate, and a crime against who ever is being undermined
__label__Evidence	scientology is a cult that must be respected like the rest thanks to our religious freedom
__label__Position	Many publications in the US media have shut off comments sections and are doing this because they believe that whilst it possibly spreads hate speech, it also has the ability to spread "fake news" or skew readers away from the facts contained in the articles. You can read more about it here: https://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-09/why-were-shutting-our-comments/
__label__Evidence	To have a chance that one candidate (with a good chance to win) comes from your own country, I think people from little countries can wait 40 years. This will definitely destroy the European belonging feeling you want to promote with this idea.
__label__Evidence	we should abolish zoos because it is cruel to cage up animals like that in one area and is not their natural habitat and essentially treat them like pets.
__label__Evidence	Some fast food restaurants offer healthy alternatives and provide a quick , nutritious meal on-the-go.
__label__Evidence	human cloning is very open to abuse and could be used for the wrong things
__label__Evidence	humans need food and this is simply another way to cultivate it. at the end of the day these animals are going to be food no matter what, so the way they get there is of little interest.
__label__Position	It is important to put attention to the fact that comments should not be randomly and uncontrollably censored since every person has the right to freely express themselves (https://rm.coe.int/16800c170f). Current algorithms are effective, but not 100% flawless in detecting hate speech and therefore should be optimized and can be used as a tool to eliminate hate speech on newspaper websites (https://ieai.sot.tum.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Research-Brief_Intervening-Against-Online-Hate-Speech_April2022_FINAL.pdf).
__label__Evidence	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Position	i would say having the option to report an offensive comment would help, other than nothing at all because then that is a start to correcting someone's choice of words or point of view.
__label__Evidence	financial incentives should be available for live donors and the families of the dead donors.
__label__Evidence	If we need work force, we should look for Europeans to come, not for Afrikans, Arabic, and Muslims.

__label__Evidence	telemarketing provides jobs, and people should be allowed to use telemarketing to earn a living.
__label__Evidence	National elections synchronization would finally make it possible to strengthen the effectiveness of the Council of the EU, by eliminating the blockages caused by the constant renewal of Ministers, which considerably slows down decision-making.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Evidence	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Evidence	we must not abolish nuclear weapons because they can be used in situations of extreme need like defending a country
__label__Evidence	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't ban private military companies because in risk of national defense
__label__Evidence	we need to take control of criminals and hold them responsible for their actions.
__label__Evidence	space exploration is needed to see how space can affect us here
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Evidence	we should not adopt gender neutral language because were created as male and female
__label__Evidence	we should adopt libertarianism because it would mean more freedom for citizens from their government.
__label__Evidence	austerity regimes hid the poor and dependent sections of society disproportionally hard, and they are those least able to withstand such reductions in spending.
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't legalize sex selection because some people can't have children at all, they should be happy that they have blessed with a miracle. if you want to choose a sex then foster or adopt a certain sex
__label__Evidence	economic sanctions are outdated and does not cause any repercussions.
__label__Evidence	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Evidence	human cloning should not be banned because it may lead to the ability to generate human organs for transplant which would save many lives
__label__Position	I agree with the point of view that there should be a broad spectrum of moderators to stop any particular biased opinion or agenda from controlling the comments.
__label__Evidence	factory farming is mass food production at a more economical pace which allows us to feed more people faster.
__label__Evidence	a team of moderators won't be a viable option because, because people can't posts comments in real time
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__Evidence	The comments section can not create fake news. It may attract people with extreme views but not people making up news themselves.

__label__Evidence	the right to bear arms had and will only lead to people killing innocent people.
__label__Evidence	I don't think algorithm can accurately detect hate speech.
__label__Position	you wanna control people thoughts???
__label__Position	reader comments are important and helpful to many users as well as the newspaper website as it can provide crucial feedback as well as being a place to further discuss relevant topics. it should not be removed but there can be many steps taken to make sure it is void of any harmful or offensive material. for example, using a program to detect and remove comments containing offensive words, or having moderators to manually remove/take disciplinary action against harmful comments and accounts
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Evidence	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Evidence	not giving much attention to certain issues can lessen hate speech
__label__Evidence	I think using personal data would be tricky. Many companies have been caught selling user's data without consent or storing it in an unsafe way, which could harm those affected by hate speech more than those who post it
__label__Evidence	ensuring everyone has a voice in our elections is critical to a functioning democracy
__label__Evidence	This will improve the language but not the other content
__label__Position	It would be a shame to remove the comment space from online newspaper articles - although I don't think that removing it would be undemocratic, or an infringement of freedom of speech. People are free to pass comment elsewhere after all, in their own blogs or social media pages. I think part of the problem with online commenting is that people can do it anonymously and without fear of reprisal. If every online comment had to be linked to an identifiable person - so readers could see who they were, who their friends were, where they worked - I think there would be less of a problem with hate speech.
__label__Evidence	we should not ban telemarketing because it is a way for a company to get business and it also provides people with jobs.
__label__Evidence	we should not ban human cloning because it could help with medical research

__label__Evidence	compulsory voting violates our rights.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Evidence	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Position	Censor out certain worsd
__label__Evidence	I agree with this statement.
__label__Position	Possibly it depends on the story in the newspaper, but generally speaking does anyone really pay attention to the comments? Sometimes people go out of their way to cause uproar and a lot of the comments, especially in the Daily Mail, are actually bots confessing true love to their "princess Meghan"

__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Evidence	It is necessary that member states better share the efforts of receiving asylum seekers upon arrival at EU borders and do not leave this responsibility to frontline countries.

__label__Evidence	The only thing Europeans don’t do together is politics. This is because national parties - not EU parties - run the show within and across Europe. After 70 years of integration, the EU lacks a European party system capable of fostering a genuine transnational space of political debate and dialogue where citizens can understand, influence, and participate in decision-making affecting their common interests as Europeans. This must change.

__label__Evidence	You'd have to get everyone to agree on a definition for cyber bullying before creating the software. Computers only know what you tell them, they aren't sentient beings capable of moral distinction. The human programming the software defines the meaning of hate speech, this really ties into the book "Noise" which discusses variables and the way it can drastically change outcomes based on the individual handling things. What is their life experience, have they experienced bullying, have they gotten therapy etc. If it's more than one person you have to collectively agree on shared experiences that culminate to the final definition of bullying.

__label__Position	We shouldn't eliminate comment sections entirely as that comes with its own repercussions but there should be some form of at least minimal moderation available on these sites to ensure that certain topics don't then become completely overwhelmed with negative/hate-filled opinions - as this blog suggests "Comment moderation is essential to grow a digital community. Without comment moderation, you open your community to abuse, profanity and spam—and turn prospective fans and customers away. It’s your responsibility to ensure your brand environment is safe and inviting to your audience." (https://www.smartmoderation.com/the-quick-and-easy-guide-to-comment-moderation)

__label__Evidence	bit over stated
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Evidence	this measure allows to move pieces in the companies and refresh the work schemes and to adapt to the new times
__label__Evidence	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Evidence	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Evidence	The development of autonomous cars should be halted until we have dealt with the moral question of who would be liable in the case of an accident, hacking or malfunction.
__label__Position	This would have severe positive environmental advantages
__label__Evidence	Trigger warnings are sufficient in preventing someone from reliving trauma in the vast majority of instances, and therefore we should abolish safe spaces to maximize free speech.

__label__Evidence	it is a waste of resources. we should develop more environmental friendly cars instead.
__label__Evidence	Factory farming should be banned as it is an unhealthy and uncaring atmosphere in which to raise animals and doesn't result in a good quality product at the end.

__label__Evidence	eliminating space for readers comments wouldn't be a good idea on my own opinion there's people who genuinely wants to give good comments and there wouldn't be space for them to.
__label__Position	Ultimately however, I think I have to agree with Patrizia. A comments section is fundamental. We must retain it, whether or not some people believe it garners hate speech or not. Personal attacks towards other people in the comments, for instance, whould not be allowed to stand. But general views, yes
__label__Evidence	Atheism should be adopted because many people do not believe in God or a higher power,
__label__Evidence	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Evidence	you can require voting but you can't force people to educate themselves about the candidates and issues
__label__Evidence	capital punishment should be abolished as man has no right to decide to take another life no matter that that person has done.
__label__Position	It seems like the only option is intervention on the newspapers part. If they don't want it to be the wild west, they'll have to put measures in place to control the rhetoric. There are many options like moderators, auto-mods or bots, required account registration, and removal of comments and users who violate the rules. Ultimately there are many options with costs associated with them, it's up to the newspapers to decide what is best for their platforms.

__label__Position	According to research by La Trobe University Australia, hate speech can be eliminated if we make use of Artificial Intelligence technology.

__label__Evidence	school uniform makes all children on a level at school, reducing their differences in background and wealth to unify the class
__label__Position	If the aim is merely to reduce hate speech then I think eradicating the comment section goes too far. Why should people not be allowed to comment and have their say. The newspaper is punishing the public for the crimes of a few. It seems rather unfair. I think the best method is to have monitors.
__label__Evidence	we should adopt a zero tolerance because it will keep the children in check.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

__label__Evidence	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Evidence	I disagree. In an Institute for Government webinar yesterday (24/10 https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/events/what-works-government-evidence-policy) the point was made that the public are not educated to challenge what they read in the media. It is therefore naive to assume that people would start to search around things they read in the news because 1) we are not taught how to do this and 2) there is no motive for people to begin to do this. Based on the amount of conspiracy documentaries on Netflix and YouTube it is possible that people would indeed search around what they read but for negative/conspiracy motives rather than as ground truthing.

__label__Position	https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3394231.3397902
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Evidence	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Evidence	I feel they do have a responsibility to monitor trolling and abusive behaviour as this can be harmful to others. A modern legal test of the legitimacy of proposed restrictions on freedom of speech was stated in the opinion by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. in Schenk v. U.S. (1919): a restriction is legitimate only if the speech in question poses a “clear and present danger”—i.e., a risk or threat to safety or to other public interests that is serious and imminent.

__label__Evidence	The idea that France should coordinate its positions on the UN Security Council with the EU is good because it does not request any specific UN decision (i.e recognizing the EU as a 'State'). It is enough that an internal EU-France agreement determines that the representative of France (appointed by agreement between France and EU) will now represent the EU (with veto right), and at the same time all other EU Member States will reinforce this representation by delegating their best specialists and put their own representation in vacancy.

__label__Position	I would not eliminate the hate speech right away but rather alarm the user and ask them to refrain from that kind of speech or ask them to elaborate or explain the reasons for the anger.

__label__Evidence	to disallow readers comments is an unnecessary response as these communities can still be found elsewhere

__label__Position	It looks as if the Government have been trying in recent years to develop plans for tackling hate crime - including targeting schools, working with newspapers and media to spread the word.
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	I agree with the comments that worry for the effects of removing comments on free speech - we need to allow for fair and diverse debate. I don't think that newspapers should be restricting comments that are only one side of the debate, as this goes a bit too close to restricting free speech. I agree that certain inflammatory words could be prevented from being used - it is possible that people would get around this, but the fact they are having to get around something might encourage them to reflect on their decision and the reasons behind it.

__label__Evidence	If you eliminate comments completely you both take away the right to free speech and inhibit the ability to have an open discussion about what constitutes hateful and offensive comments
__label__Evidence	Unmoderated online comment forums are magnets for noxious speech. For years they have carried people’s discontent out into the world, while the writers sit safely behind screens. It’s almost bittersweet to think back on the time we once blamed internet flaming on the online disinhibition of middle school pranksters. It is the many unhappy adults in the electorate who are posting the things they are really thinking in comment boxes. Nearly three-quarters of internet users – 73 percent – have witnessed online harassment. News website comment sections host antagonistic conversations between contributors. Nine out of 10 respondents of a Pew Research study said the online environment was more enabling of criticism. The squabbling can be overwhelming: As many as 34 percent of news commenters and 41 percent of news comment readers identified argumentative comments as the reason they avoid reading or joining the discourse. Multiple studies show online communities develop sophisticated norms that guide participants. Anger begets more anger. Unshackled digital vitriol is now volleyed back and forth online from all sides. Some commenters don’t even care if they are anonymous anymore. Researchers have found real-name comments on social media are actually nastier than unsigned commentary. Historically, American democracy always had some rudeness baked into it. For example, during the presidential election of 1800, incumbent President John Adams’ campaign proclaimed “murder, robbery, rape, adultery and incest will all be openly taught and practiced” if his opponent, Thomas Jefferson, won the presidency. Jefferson, meanwhile, described Adams as “a hideous hermaphroditical character,” with “neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman.” Civility in public discourse is often what people in power expect of their citizens. Demands for civility can be used by those with authority to deny power to those with none. People who feel marginalized or alienated use incivility and civil disobedience to fight the power. By causing offense and indignation, as we saw during Campaign 2016, outsiders gained massive attention for their cause. Yet “democracy only functions when its participants abide by certain conventions, certain codes of conduct and a respect for the process,” wrote cultural journalist Neal Gabler in an eloquent essay about how a hateful electorate threatens democracy. Gabler noted that the 2016 presidential campaign was referred to as the “hate election” because everyone professed to hate both candidates. It turned out to be the hate election, Gabler mused, “because of the hatefulness of the electorate.” He went on:https://theconversation.com/how-news-sites-online-comments-helped-build-our-hateful-electorate-70170

__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Evidence	Algorithms and AI are much more advanced than the common person thinks. AI is able to discern intent. It is not solely based on keywords like a primitive AI from 30 years ago.
__label__Evidence	I think an AI could be very useful as well because it would take emotion out of equation when reaching decisions about what speech should be weeded out.
__label__Position	It is too easy for people to use the term 'free speech' and how it is a fundamental right, when really they are using it to excuse 'hate speech' which should never be tolerated. There are other ways that people can share their ideas in a respectful way.

__label__Evidence	legalizing organ trade could lead to some horrific situations such as organs being taken from unwilling donors.
__label__Evidence	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.

__label__Evidence	children have not grown and truly formed their adult looks. cosmetic surgery for a child should be banned until as an adult the child can make a informed choice over their bodies not a whim of a child.
__label__Position	It is so important that we are able to give opinions and reactions to newspapers on their platforms. Free speech should be encouraged, not silenced.

__label__Evidence	Physicist Stephen Hawkings warns that we are close to the tipping point, but climate change can be reversed if the human race acts now.

__label__Position	A way to combat the root issue of hate speech is to educate people. On the newspaper site there could be resources to inform people of how harmful hate speech really is. We can also educate people on our differences and how to celebrate these rather than turn against eachother. https://www.stompoutbullying.org/blog/hate-speech
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news.

__label__Evidence	whaling is part of a great number of cultures
__label__Evidence	cosmetic surgery is a fundamental right of a person to be able to do what they want to their own body and the governmental should not be able to interfere with that right.
__label__Evidence	Somewhat agree with this statement. The marginalised are oftentimes the focus of hate.

__label__Evidence	We cannot rely to other people to recognize hate
__label__Evidence	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Evidence	I think it is important for newspapers to provide a platform for people to express and discuss their opinions. Being able to hear other peoples' opinions is an important part of educating oneself, so completely eliminating a comment section seems unprogressive.

__label__Evidence	Abolishing the veto right in the current EU foreign policy voting procedure will be the death of European solidarity. It would turn Europe into a polarized entity much like the American system and would firmly divide the European community on every issue.

__label__Evidence	diseases can be cured using cells created for embryonic stem cell research.

__label__Evidence	but the amount of comments is what puts too much of a strain on moderators
__label__Evidence	adopting gender-neutral language would prevent children from believing they can't do certain things. for example a girl should be able to have aspirations to be president if she so chose.
__label__Evidence	Even though damage is done, there are ways to counter the damage through other actions. If enough of these are done, they can cumulatively overpower the irreversible actions and thus reduce climate change as a net overall.
__label__Evidence	We should abolish the three-strikes laws because they introduce arbitrary punishment for some crimes over others, when the action was the same.
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Position	The EU should strengthen its ties with Ukraine and prepare for EU membership of Ukraine.
__label__Evidence	I agree that moderation would help in this case so everyone feels safe to share their opinion

__label__Evidence	subsidised journalism leaves us at risk of governmental interference in the news we are allowed to see.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Evidence	People are now engaging in trolling and cyberbullying. Hiding behind devices is giving them the courage to harass other people, which they may not do face-to-face. This is the deterioration of moral values.

__label__Evidence	we should subsidize embryonic stem cell research so that it can continue research into finding solutions to complex medical needs.
__label__Evidence	But also those people who fear migrants, thinking they are all criminals (while 99% of them are people coming to work, improving their family's life, and paying taxes) will need someone to pay their retirement benefits/ pensions and to push their wheelchairs...
__label__Position	education is the solution
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Evidence	allowing people to use a gateway drug like cannabis is steering them towards a life of addiction.

__label__Evidence	too many people do not take responsibility for their part in democracy
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	The best way would be to introduce some kind of moderators who have clear definitions and limitations on what hate speech can be.

__label__Evidence	I don't think this is the way forward - check out this article:https://ai.facebook.com/blog/ai-advances-to-better-detect-hate-speech/
__label__Evidence	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Position	There is simply no place for hate speech in today's society. Even if you are not the intended victim, there are ways you can take a stand against it. The following article provides some helpful tips: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/take-action/engage
__label__Evidence	This would completely take away the opportunity for these people who use the comment section to post hate speech.

__label__Evidence	This could hurt many people who will be affected by negative comments
__label__Evidence	student loans is a help for those who do not have resources
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	while free speech is our right and we are entitled to our own opinions, when you are promoting/endorsing hatred and discrimination of any sort, the line should be drawn. having a discussion/debate with opposing sides is normal and gives insight to both sides with little bias, but that cannot be used as an excuse to be hateful or discriminatory.
__label__Evidence	nuclear weapons have helped keep the peace in a dangerous and uncertain world for several decades
__label__Evidence	banning telemarketing would destroy many businesses leading to masses of forced redundancies.
__label__Evidence	Spam calls
__label__Evidence	I agree. Some for of moderation is needed. Users should have to agree to some sort of "anti hate speech" policy when signing up and accounts who violate the policy (by posting hate speech) should be banned. The moderation can be done similarly to how social media platforms such as Instagram allows users to filter out certain keywords from their comment section and any comments with those words do not appear in the comment section as seen here ( https://help.instagram.com/700284123459336 )

__label__Evidence	Hate speech is not free speech when it can lead to attacks on people and how they choose to live their lives.

__label__Evidence	compulsory voting would ensure that more people were getting their voice heard at election time, making a fairer election

__label__Evidence	I've seen it work well, but the algorithm needs to be somewhat transparent

__label__Position	https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons
__label__Evidence	Whaling is an important industry in some countries for their economical stability.

__label__Evidence	should be included in free speech
__label__Position	After reading of many comments my position remains largely the same. However, I do concede that it is difficult knowing where to draw the line between reasonable and unreasonable forms of censorship. To counteract this, I believe websites should have to be really transparent about what types of comments they do and don't allow on their platform and why.
__label__Evidence	Either the EU will be a fortress against illegal migration or it will not exist anymore in the future.
__label__Position	We should subsidize journalism
__label__Evidence	but how fast is it progressing and can we slow it enough to even make a difference?

__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading has its disadvantages which include system failure risks,network connectivity errors, time-lags between trade orders and execution and, most important of all, imperfect algorithms.

__label__Position	We should use waste from the agri-food industry in the ruminant feed chain
__label__Evidence	safe spaces are necessary to have a place of safety for all
__label__Evidence	we should legalize cannabis because a natural plant should not be regulated. cannabis is shown to naturally help with certain medical conditions and it's much safer than alcohol for recreational use.
__label__Evidence	if we begin to play god with our scientific advances that could very well lead to our demise.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Position	The newspapers should encourage the victims of hate speech to report hate speech published, establish monitoring and evaluation units in newsrooms. Some units should be tasked with monitoring hate sppech trends, compiling reports and bringing these to the attention of key institutions
__label__Position	Reducing hate speech needs to be a priority. We need to teach people how to express their opinions effectively without reverting to hate speech, we need to educate on the extent of the hurt hate speech brings and the trauma it is often derived from. Education is key and allows people to debate and disagree with respect, those who cannot do this should be removed or monitored from sites
__label__Evidence	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Evidence	true, but maybe they can remove anonymity so that everyone can be accountable for what they say.
__label__Evidence	safe spaces are endorsing segregation instead of engouraging debate
__label__Evidence	minors are not mature enough to make such life altering decisions
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Evidence	all avenues should be looked at, not just the supposedly straight forward.
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.

__label__Evidence	Capital punishment incentivizes criminals to work with and confess to police as a means of potentially reducing their sentence and avoiding death, even if ti means life without parole.
__label__Position	Large companies need to invest more money in having paiI td moderators to monitor hate speech on their articles. I think all speech excpet for speech inciting people to commit violence or murder should be allowed even if i so not agree with it. I think that to prevent hate sppech it will start with educating young people
__label__Evidence	I agree that hate speech should not be tolerated, but I don't think that it requires the total removal of space for comments, as the comments add value. I believe that moderation is the way forward.
__label__Evidence	Transparency is the first key to real democracy. Although today, Council meetings are partially live-streamed, most of the meetings are behind closed doors. This is an especially big problem with the Eurogroup and Eurosummit, which are shady informal meetings. Or think about all the meetings between diplomats (Coreper) and civil servants (working groups and committees), where ±90% of decisions are made, for the Council to be rubberstamped. Meetings that most citizens don't even know about.
__label__Evidence	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?

__label__Position	by providing some form of censorship on the comments put up
__label__Position	We should all have the option to voice our opinion. If doing so can result in hate speech, then we have to find a way to fight it instead of trying to eliminate comments altogether. Flagging certain words or using algorithms could potentially could help hide comments that don't add any value and are just trying to cause harm
__label__Evidence	The risk of nuclear war has made great powers more likely to turn to negotiation and cooperation to settle disputes, and abolishing nuclear weapons would make war less costly and more likely.
__label__Position	Some people just like to spread their negative vibes on strangers, not worried about serious consequences, as the worst thing that can happen to them is the comment being removed. There should be consequences!
__label__Evidence	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Evidence	we should limit executive compensation because it will lead to having to pay taxes at the highest tier
__label__Evidence	banning child actors would limit movies and tv shows. anything with children in the story would be unable to be made. television and movies for children would no longer exist either.
__label__Evidence	If the children are used to uniforms, they will no issues in the future if their profession demands uniform.
__label__Evidence	Reduces clear violations
__label__Evidence	Not allowing hateful comment does not mean we limit people freedom of speech but promote kindness.
__label__Position	The purpose of a comment section is for everyone to express their opinions on a certain topic and can provide feedback. Completely removing the comment section may be disadvantageous in some cases so instead of completely removing it perhaps it can be moderated on a regular basis and remove inappropriate comments.
__label__Evidence	The downside to this is who will moderate and what will be their baseline. It's a real challenge.
__label__Evidence	algorithms can be hacked and therefore the data isn't safe, and should therefore be banned.

__label__Evidence	legalizing prostitution will enable more protection for those taking part. more safety factors can be required to protect those who are in the profession.
__label__Evidence	legal and regulated prostitution would protect sex workers from violence and poor health outcomes.
__label__Evidence	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Evidence	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Evidence	Even if someone has a degree in IT, they have to learn so many things to get into the IT job, because there is a gap between the industrial standards and the skills that are taught in Engineering colleges. Moreover, as technology is constantly evolving, even if someone has prepared themselves for the industrial standards in their graduation, they have to learn new technologies continuously to stay relevant in the job market. So, as the learning curve will be there even for IT students, students from non-IT backgrounds can also learn these things and can get into IT jobs.
__label__Evidence	we should adopt atheism because science can explain how we got here without needing a god to explain it.
__label__Evidence	There are adequate provisions in the Income Tax law and with the Election Commission so that people can have whatever information they want.
__label__Position	Eliminating the comments section will reduce engagement and the sense of having a dialogue / encouraging free speech in the publication, which would be detrimental to the newspaper. Having comment moderation, in moderation (no pun intended!) would probably be the best way forward. https://ethicaljournalismnetwork.org/online-comment-moderation-emerging-best-practices
__label__Evidence	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Evidence	I agree and I think because there are so many people with so many different opinions, it should be censored before it is either posted or passed through the section.
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Position	The technical team of the newspaper should select comments that don't promote hate speech and make those comments the only ones that are going to appear on the newspaper's websites.
__label__Evidence	space exploration has the ability to solve the problem of limited materials on earth
__label__Position	I like the idea from AndreasS that comments could only be made ny individuals that have a subscription with the newspaper. If there was hate speech they can then be held accountable.
__label__Evidence	we should not subsidize space exploration since that is a waste of money.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__Evidence	missionary work has a long history of being cruel and detrimental and often inhumane to the people the missionaries tried to convert.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Evidence	School uniforms reduce bullying. Poor kids aren't a target to be laughed at because their clothes aren't fashionable or expensive.
__label__Position	love this idea actually!
__label__Evidence	We should halt all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries into the EU. However, if we want to stop this immigration, we must stop its causes. Indeed, it is war, poverty, and European, Chinese and American neo-colonialism that make the people of African and Middle Eastern countries flee to Europe. So Europe must finally take responsibility and protect these countries from corruption, war, and neo-colonialism and help them to start their economy.
__label__Evidence	Exactly. Just ignore the hate speech. Like in real life you just ignore the bullies
__label__Evidence	We should not adopt an austerity regime because austerity only made countries like Greece and Argentina poorer.
__label__Evidence	it is a gateway drug, and we don't want to encourage people to go down this dangerous path.
__label__Evidence	economic sanctions are an effective way to signify that human rights abuses will not be tolerated.
__label__Evidence	the olympic games put too much of a financial strain on host cities so they should be done away with
__label__Evidence	Europe can no longer afford to neglect to defend its external borders and promote policies that favor illegal migration and fuel human trafficking. Strong and effective borders are the pre-condition to any aspect of a common migration policy.
__label__Evidence	I do not agree that it should be allowed to be there at all.
__label__Evidence	nuclear weapons are very volatile and should be done away with.
__label__Evidence	If there are language problems, we need to work on national integration systems, e.g. in France where English is being thought in French. language.
__label__Evidence	removing the comment space completely would allow people to focus solely on the content of the news and not allow people to provide their comments, this might give people the chance to be completely objective and just focus on what is in front of them instead of them using the comment space as a place to vent their frustrations.
__label__Position	agree with not deleting comments, we should live it open and just regulated
__label__Evidence	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Position	We should prohibit women in combat
__label__Evidence	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Evidence	by adopting a zero-tolerance policy in schools we can cut bullying out since those who do it will be removed from the school.
__label__Evidence	in this world of bullying and political devisivness, people need places to go feel safe
__label__Position	I think that what people comment should be monitored, we cannot allow people to celebrate racism, homophobia and fatphobia all in the name of free speech.
__label__Evidence	Zoos are a great and cheap way for children to learn about animals from all over the world.
__label__Evidence	That is actually a good idea, but gives a lot of power to the moderators.
__label__Position	There should be a moderator monitoring the comment sections, removing the hateful and/or unnecessary comments.Another person should be in charge of double checking that the reasoning behind decisions made about deleting and keeping comments is valid. There should be a standard set for comments to be allowed to stay in the comment sections. Although the decision about whether or not the comments are hateful is susceptible to subjectivity, it's a better option than leaving hate speech on the website for all to view.
__label__Evidence	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Evidence	this should be banned as it is immoral.
__label__Evidence	whaling is profitable for the people that do it and would result in a loss of income and tradition.
__label__Position	In order to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. Active communinty management and moderation is required. This helps keep people in line with the community guildelines.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Evidence	development of autonomous car will make traffic and parking easier
__label__Evidence	intellectual property rights stifle growth and information by stopping the free-flowing of ideas.
__label__Evidence	I agree completely. I argue that it is not up to the newspaper websites to police such discussion and that comments only harm the neutral perspective that they offer. There are plenty of other discussion platforms #like Reddit, Facebook, or Twitter, where such discussions could take place and where other users have the power to moderate the community opinion themselves.
__label__Evidence	we should ban private military companies because it relies too much on government funding
__label__Position	The best solution would be one that elegantly ties the reduction of hate speech in the comment section with no detrimental effect to the publics freedom of speech. This could be done by setting guidelines for hate speech, and also ensuring that the public provides identifying information such as their email address and especially their phone number. Both can be tracked to the person. To take it even further would be to be able to collect data such as ip addresses( with the commenters permission of course) when the person sends their comment so as to be able hold them accountable for any hate speech they send in. This will prevent people from using such language and hoping to hide under anonymity.
__label__Evidence	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Evidence	judicial review is a crucial fallback to monitor political activity

__label__Evidence	embryonic stem cell research should be subsidized because it could lead to massive changes in human beings. this type of research could reverse aging, change genes, and learn how to cure diseases.
__label__Position	People who take part in hate speech should be dealt with lawfully so as its a form of cyber-bullying, that way less people will resort to hate speech
__label__Evidence	this research is very controversial and against many religions
__label__Position	Policing the comments section by the newspaper does run the risk silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech, but law-abiding and Nobel citizens wont shy away from engaging in the topics, its only those ill-mouthed readers who will run that risk.policing the comments sections should be mandatory because if its not in place, they run the risk of losing readers due to them feeling unsafe and not protected
__label__Evidence	other languages such as spanish and french have even more gendered language than we do, and they have no problems
__label__Position	We should subsidize higher education institutions
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Evidence	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Evidence	organ trade would allow for more people to get transplants because there would be more availability.
__label__Evidence	capital punishment should be removed from society as it is a backwards and medieval solution to crime that has no place in a modern society.
__label__Evidence	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Evidence	space exploration is already being funded and if a private business is interested in it they've got to pay for it
__label__Evidence	You're trusting an algorithm that would need to be trained by humans - so the AI itself could still be biased.
__label__Evidence	when hate speech encourages violence or discrimination against any specific class of people it should be removed regardless of how inoffensive an particular individual might find it
__label__Evidence	embryonic stem cell research could lead to massive scientific break through that could save millions of lives. funding this would mean the difference of life and death to many people.
__label__Evidence	Arms are very bad for the whole of society when they are in the hands of bad persons. giving anyone the right to keep and bear arms puts society in danger
__label__Evidence	intellectual property rights stifle creativity since all ideas are built upon the ideas of the past.
__label__Evidence	banning fats food should be obligatory for all governments as hurting people health.
__label__Evidence	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	We should strengthen our ties with Ukraine and prepare for its membership in the EU
__label__Evidence	a zero tolerance policy will scare the children into behaving and following the rules.

__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Evidence	atheism could be of great benefit because it would foster more scientific ideas which could prevent our demise from global warming and other looming challenges
__label__Evidence	people can make a living from prostitution
__label__Evidence	i think the we shouldn't ban the use of child actors because is good for thier cultural formation
__label__Evidence	we should abolish capital punishment because sometimes people are wrongfully accused and once dead cannot bring them back so life in prison is better
__label__Evidence	sometimes a case has extenuating circumstances that would require a judge to make a different ruling.
__label__Evidence	Hate speech is not just someone's opinion. It affects people's lives with real consequences, resulting with cases such as severe depression and suicide. https://www.journalofcommunication.ro/index.php/journalofcommunication/article/view/322/307
__label__Position	Hate speech is a problem in a world that is becoming more and more polarised; our basic human rights and freedoms are in jeopardy if we can be subjected to violence just because of our race, gender, sexual orientation... It's important to work on the root of the problem and provide quality education from an early age so that children become more used to diversity. Eliminating space for readers comments won't prevent hate speech from existing, so it's just a patch to a bigger problem.
__label__Position	In terms of readers posting a comment on a newspaper website, they should be informed on what the newspaper website sees as hate speech. Things will be clear from there
__label__Evidence	people have the right to fix their perceived flaws and raise their self esteem.
__label__Evidence	judicial activism is necessary to protect the rights of Americans because they seek to weed out the injustices within the system.
__label__Evidence	we should end mandatory retirement because a person should be able to work for as long as they wish as long as they do not pose as a safety threat to those around them.
__label__Position	Newspapers should not be treated as fora for individuals to share opinions, and only deliver factual basis for news
__label__Evidence	I agree. However, policies that educate people on how to deliver their speech is imperative
__label__Evidence	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Evidence	we should ban algorithmic trading because algorithms don't always work and will cause people to lose a lot of money
__label__Evidence	different people will have different interpretations of 'disrespectful'
__label__Evidence	I agree with this because as much as one has freedom of speech, be mindful of others and do not be disrespectful
__label__Evidence	let the free market determine whether telemarketing is a viable option
__label__Evidence	private military companies can hold bias and due to past experiences and can result in dangerous sctivities for the wrong reasons.
__label__Evidence	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Evidence	libertarianism allows the expression of free will and would make society more interesting by allowing people to be as they truly are.
__label__Position	We should promote Zero Budget Natural Farming all over India
__label__Evidence	space exploration should be privatized and maybe we'd get somewhere.
__label__Evidence	But too much freedom creates all the hate and toxicity we see in today's media
__label__Evidence	Yes, though some countries have other problems right now. Give member states the possibility to choose: more refugees & more money & support or less refugees & less money & support. Very simple.
__label__Evidence	The EU is an association, an international organization, and has nothing to do with Europe as a territory. European people may live inside or outside the EU. I think has nothing to do with arrogance.
__label__Evidence	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	zero tolerance will improve educational standards and behaviour leading to better learning outcomes.
__label__Evidence	this could cause imbalance in population, if a generation is selected as mainly male or female
__label__Evidence	I agree, everyone has the right to their opinion and to express it
__label__Evidence	zoos aren't all properly regulated and some animals are kept in appalling conditions they should be left in their natural environment
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Evidence	economic sanctions are an effective way to limit the ability of corrupt governments

__label__Evidence	Racism &amp; white supremacy has increased in Trump's term.
__label__Evidence	an austerity regime can prevent people from having the funds they need to live the life they chose.
__label__Evidence	we should not prohibit school prayer because the constitution gives us freedom of religion and prayer does not infringe on others.
__label__Evidence	we should end mandatory retirement because some people need to work longer to be able to support themselves and/or their families
__label__Evidence	having safe spaces isolates groups of people instead exposing them
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading should be banned as the software can be hacked by criminals.
__label__Evidence	I totally agree, maybe would be glad if a press company could be sanctioned for misleading information, or even if it repeats, they could have their press licenses voided. It is crazy how much misleading information is out there, many people are sharing it and nobody is taking responsibility for it. In addition, there could be a discussion in which only verified users (real people) could have access to the press's online chat/discussion under the reported topic.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	I agree
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Evidence	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Evidence	collectivism focuses on the group as a whole and diminishes the rights of the individual.

__label__Evidence	i agree that a zero-tolerance policy in schools is a good idea since it would mean that our children are safer when they go to school.
__label__Evidence	Major societal changes that will impact on all members of society are needed if we are to tackle climate change. Government, local councils, businesses, community and environmental organisations are all going to have to set targets and make difficult decisions. We need to ensure that there is active support for these changes from all parts of society.

__label__Evidence	students should be able to state their opinions and by so learn to mature. by punishing at first sign of disobedience we are just have conformity not learning.

__label__Evidence	freedom of speech needs to be maintained whilst making sure other people's rights are not violated and people do not have to read 'hate speech' which is offensive to them personally,
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Evidence	We should oppose collectivism because while it can be used to help everyone, it gives too much power to the collective to hurt individuals.
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading gives people an unfair advantage because they can trade so much more quickly and therefore it should be banned.

__label__Position	WEBSITES BREACH FREEDOM OF SPEECH by eliminating space for readers comments
__label__Position	Comment spaces should be moderated, perhaps even approved before posting.
__label__Evidence	I agree with this stance. Based on the evidence provided by research, it is possible to have a balanced discussion on a topic without being aggressive or hateful. Moderation in comments may help with this
__label__Evidence	zero-tolerance policies are helpful as they stop children misbehaving
__label__Evidence	Nuclear weapon maintenance is much cheaper than keeping up traditional weapons and infrastructure of war, so we should keep our nuclear weapons in order to maintain the current deterrence against war at the lowest price possible.
__label__Evidence	if parents agree for their kids to do acting, i can`t see any problem with it.
__label__Evidence	Nuclear weapons can bring about a certain level of respect
__label__Evidence	The internet has provided unprecedented opportunities to express and comment on almost anything. But this also brings with it responsibility. Where is the boundary between freedom of expression and speech hate speech, which is no longer tolerated by the law? How can we oppose such acts – such as insults, vulgarism, or threats on social networks? Or can everyone say anything on the internet?
__label__Position	I am sorry but NO. Almost the whole human civilisation runs of fossil fuels pumped from the deep carbon cycle to the fast carbon cycle. It will reverse naturally over several million years, not the short-term which we can benefit from right now.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a topic that has many sides. it depends on a person what they see as hate speech. I can see an opinion on a subject while another person will feel attacked by that opinion. This is a thin red line that I do think AI's created in the world with trying to please everybody. In the end, the opinion of a person is not seen as an opinion anymore, but rather hate speech. My suggestion would be for all people to respect each others opinion, like we use to and not take everything so personal now a days. If the shoe fits, wear it. If it does not effect you, don't comment. And NEVER be personal in your opinion. Live and let live again in the world is what is needed.

__label__Evidence	The undemocratic nature and perception of the presidency and the commission were used very effectively during the Brexit referendum campaign to change the minds of even the most reasonable pro-EU and anti-Brexit voters as EU political representatives were already remote and inaccessible to many people, with unrecognized names, faces, and campaign points.

__label__Evidence	ending mandatory retirement is the right thing to help older people.
__label__Evidence	we need to find a new planet with resources before we use ours up, putting more into space exploration would help accomplish this.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__Position	Comments should be monitored and hate comments should be deleted immediately and those who engage in those activities regularly should be banned from using the platform
__label__Evidence	we should abolish because it changes an animals behavior versus if they were free in the wild
__label__Evidence	Calling on the denegration on other people is not "Having an opinion" your view is your own, and you can have it, however when that overlaps into criticising other people for no other reason than they are differrent is not a "view", it is bigotry. So there needs to be some form of moderation.
__label__Position	I think it would be a very good idea to have moderators on heavily commented on articles. Again I think it would help if comments were restricted to the article and people are not allowed to comment on what other people have said
__label__Position	In summary, I think comment sections in newspapers should be preserved but with some form of moderation -- both automatic through software and human-driven. I recognize that there is a need to protect free speech, but hate speech goes beyond the type of discourse that should be protected.
__label__Position	We need to build up European Defence while remaining in NATO
__label__Position	We should get migration from Asia, and South East Asia because Europe is too old.
__label__Evidence	This is a fine point. Though if I take a more literal stance, this kind of deletion wouldn't happen as the moderators wouldn't accept it in the first place? If they did decide to remove posts afterwards, the interference may become more and more common, resulting in a news publisher that is increasingly political - something you'd want to avoid on a platform that gives people a range of speech and perspectives.
__label__Evidence	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Evidence	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Position	The title of the discussion (increasing knowledge of all by all) is not related to its content (understanding the effects of climate change on historic buildings). therefore, there is disappointment and little engagement. For a good deliberation to work, its subject must be debated. But this is not exactly the case here.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Evidence	telemarketing should be banned because it is disruptive to the course of the day for many people.
__label__Evidence	space exploration is a good adventure. our planet is in a future risk of extinct and we should best prepare our refuge in space exploration

__label__Evidence	factory farms keep animals in tight spaces. they are forced to live in cages and not allowed to roam as they were meant to.
__label__Evidence	Don't let anyone fool you with talks about deterrence and so-called "nuclear peace" - weapons are made to kill, this is their sole purpose. And nuclear weapons are made to kill millions! They are pure evil.
__label__Evidence	I disagree, each country must be sovereign to establish its migration policy and no EU quotas should be accepted.
__label__Position	Exactly - there are plenty of other online spaces where people can comment on articles - no need for them to also be able to comment directly under the articles themselves.
__label__Evidence	minors are not mature enough to make these decisions
__label__Position	Holocaust denial should be a criminal offence
__label__Evidence	Legalizing the organ trade would allow more patients to receive the organ transplant they need.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Evidence	we should continue to keep prostitution as an illegal activity because it demoralizes women and often the women are abused.
__label__Evidence	organ trade between consenting parties should be an option as it can reduce wait times.
__label__Evidence	Many jobs, like airplane pilots and doctors, are tasked with they physical safety of hundred of others. Companies have an obligation to make sure people holding those positions are the most capable, which old age threatens.
__label__Position	By warning users that hate speech will have consequences of being eliminated and blocked from the page and also making the system to monitor such users actively
__label__Evidence	minors should be allowed plastic surgery, so long as they get consent from their parents and the plastic surgeon.
__label__Evidence	cosmetic surgery causes unnecessary risks to the patient for a purely narcissistic procedure.
__label__Evidence	couples should be able to select the sex of their child since some may only want boys or may want girls. they may also already have more then one child of a certain sex and want the other sex next time.
__label__Evidence	it would give people more of a choice and provides someone for every culture to vote for
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't ban human cloning as it could help aid genetic medical problems
__label__Evidence	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Evidence	Europe is more than rich enough to welcome many immigrants and if they are permitted to work, they will even generate their own income and benefits for the country they arrive in.
__label__Position	The newspaper could automate hate speech content deletion. For example certain shares could be automatically deleted/removed.
__label__Evidence	at this time many people are dying because they do not get an organ transplant. organ trade would incentivize people to be more prepared to have their relatives organs transplanted to save others
__label__Evidence	in certain circumstances it's impossible to detain highly dangerous individuals who pose a threat, the only option is targeted killing.
__label__Evidence	everyone should have a chance to celebrate their culture, gay culture included.
__label__Evidence	by legalizing prostitution we would be making it safer for the prostitute by taking control away from the violent crime organizations
__label__Evidence	wikipedia is not free to run even if it is free to users. subsidization would help keep it free for users.
__label__Evidence	i enjoy reading comments but some comments can be sweary,name calling, troll like behaviour, which should be stopped.
__label__Evidence	A cashless economy will increase the number of cybercrimes.
__label__Position	It can be done by taking into consideration the feelings of the people who will get to read the newspaper. The person or persons that will be responsible in writing the newspaper must know what will and will not hurt the people who will be reading the newspaper.
__label__Evidence	Cosmetic surgery promotes a capitalistic society that focuses on solving problems with money rather than personal acceptance.
__label__Evidence	economic sanctions affect the poor more than the tyrants
__label__Evidence	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Position	https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation This is a good summary of the position I hold.
__label__Evidence	No one can be informed about the debate - just the newspapers view - which in and of itself will be from their point of view
__label__Evidence	I don't think that simply mitigating the problem should be our focus.
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't fight to get rid of nuclear weapons. they provide a deterrent to serious conflict because even the smaller countries who have nuclear weapons pose a threat
__label__Evidence	prevents people being upset,
__label__Evidence	prostitution perpetuates the abuse of the vulnerable and funds should be redirected to help them
__label__Evidence	We should not ban whaling because there are whale species that could be sustainably harvested, albeit not all whale species.
__label__Position	Some people can just delete someone's comment not necessarily it is a hate speech, but because they do not like the person.
__label__Evidence	we should not adopt atheism as people have the right to believe the way they want when it come to a higher power.
__label__Evidence	it is inaccurate and should not be funded by government money.
__label__Position	On the other hand, people have the right to not receive unnecessary hate on the internet by trolls. https://www.journalofcommunication.ro/index.php/journalofcommunication/article/view/322 this study shows that hate speech online has a negative effect on lgbt people. People shouldn't be subjected to discrimination for their sexual orientation or race ect. Maybe censor words that offend protected classes? women, lgbt, minorities ect.
__label__Evidence	This could provide organs for transplant patients in dire need as well as many other medical advancements.
__label__Evidence	acting takes children away from their education and normal childhood pursuits
__label__Evidence	"There should be a justification for ANY building being demolished" (Steven Bee)
__label__Position	I think that education with penalties such as exclusion from the community for repeated offences is the best policy. Like many I agree that some people are unaware they unaware they have caused offence to others.
__label__Evidence	very time consuming
__label__Evidence	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Evidence	Gambling addiction can lead to increase in crime rates, mental illnesses.
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading is faster and more accurate than human guesswork and so provides greater value to shareholders.
__label__Evidence	we just don't have enough excess funds yo support this type of exploration.
__label__Evidence	it is unjust and discriminates against minorities
__label__Evidence	Executive compensation should be limited so that those who are at the bottom can make more money.
__label__Evidence	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Evidence	I think this is definitely important and will help but we need so much more than this. To me this is just one of the many important steps and changes we must make. All of these things and all of us working together can make a significant change.
__label__Evidence	Trolls don't really care about anything but trolling so trying to reason with them is futile.
__label__Evidence	there are things at pride parades that young children should not see, regardless of one's sexual preferences.
__label__Position	One approach is that followed by The Guardian where comments are switched off for articles about topics which tend to generate a lot of hate speech https://www.joe.ie/news/the-guardian-website-will-no-longer-allow-comments-under-articles-about-race-immigration-and-islam-528924
__label__Evidence	we need to do whatever it takes to keep our citizens safe, and that includes getting rid of individuals that lead and encourage terrorist organizations.

__label__Evidence	allowing sex selection would alleviate the depression faced by mother's who truly wanted one gender over another.
__label__Evidence	we should ban factory farming as its cruel and inhumane to animals
__label__Evidence	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Evidence	it is a gateway drug that can lead to far worse drugs
__label__Evidence	compulsory voting makes the population more involved in the election process, and would give results that more accurately reflected the will of the electors.
__label__Evidence	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Evidence	compulsory voting goes against people's liberties and freedoms.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	collectivism leads to a stagnant culture where new ideas are never formed and expressed
__label__Evidence	we should abolish intellectual property rights because we never can truly know that someone came up with something.
__label__Evidence	Fast food provides a cheap and consistent meal for many people who see it as an occasional meal or treat and this should not be restricted because others cannot make good dietary choices.
__label__Evidence	All young people whether rich or poor should have the opportunity to better their lives by going to into higher education, the more student loans are subsidized the closer this will become a reality.
__label__Evidence	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Evidence	We should not ban the church of scientology since people should be able to join any religion they want to.
__label__Evidence	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Evidence	if a person wants to continue working, that is their right. they should not be forced to stop based on some arbitrary rule made up by someone.
__label__Evidence	Yes the costs are very high and most technologies in the [past have failed such as wind turbines etc which need electricity which cancels the effort
__label__Position	I believe that comment sections should remain open, but should be monitored and flagged for key words or harmful messages. Having a space to respectfully critique or share add on ideas allows readers to continue to think critically about the article at hand and form educated opinions considering both sides or an argument.
__label__Evidence	The nations must have the final say regarding whom they want to allow to live on their sovereign territories.
__label__Position	Thank you for this!, this is a great idea
__label__Evidence	we should ban fast food as it is very unhealthy and is creating a lazy culture in which people do not cook or eat fresh food.
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading gives some people an unfair advantage
__label__Evidence	would require more than 1 moderator
__label__Evidence	private militaries are a threat to security if they decide to overthrow the government
__label__Position	Wind and solar energy resources are a commodity, provided by big companies.
__label__Evidence	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	journalism should not be subsidized because subsidies could too easily be allotted according to political beliefs.
__label__Evidence	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Evidence	the right to keep and bear arms is an american constitutional right to protect one's self and family and this right should not be violated.
__label__Evidence	More investment into cosmetic surgery has overflow benefits for reconstructive and general surgery to due innovative technology and techniques.
__label__Evidence	we should not adopt an austerity regime because it will harm a good process.
__label__Position	The comment section is a good way to be interactive with the public and creates a community where discussions can take place and people get to exercise freedom of speech. However if not regulated it could cause harm because people use it for hate speech
__label__Evidence	Hate speech is a nonsense concept.
__label__Evidence	legalising prostitution can only be beneficial to the sex workers and their clients from a safety and health point of view.
__label__Position	i believe commenting should have it's policy, where users have to read the policy before commenting. So if a user uses language that promotes hate speech, the comment should be removed.
__label__Evidence	I agree, it is just what I said.
__label__Evidence	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Evidence	the church of scientology is a cult that is harming society.
__label__Evidence	Zoos are a great way for people to learn about animals
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Evidence	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Evidence	voter turnout these days are dropping steadily so we need to make everyone vote to show the true representation of the people
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Evidence	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Evidence	in tough economic times it is critical to increase consumer spending and demand. this cannot be done through an austerity regime.
__label__Position	moderation is is very helpful in these instances,also having certain keywords automatically blocked.
__label__Evidence	the country has freedom of religion and the church of scientology is a form of religion.
__label__Evidence	this country was founded on christian principles; we cannot abandon these customs.
__label__Evidence	I actually really like this idea - it deals well with the issue of removing hate speech as nothing just gets automatically published and checked later. Yes it will cut down on the amount of comments overall but even that isn't a bad thing, if only the most coherent, high-quality comments are published.
__label__Evidence	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Evidence	Just arguing to keep migrants out is very shortsighted and unhistorical. By keeping migrants out, migration pressure will not abate. So what do you suggest for next year, 10 years from now?
__label__Evidence	we should subsidize space exploration to find what information is available in our solar system.
__label__Evidence	targeted killing is often the only way to get to the enemy.
__label__Evidence	some people don't care about voting and if required would just pick random choices, which could have disastrous consequences.
__label__Evidence	pride parades sometimes bring out hate and crazy people.
__label__Evidence	Many students struggle with several issues such as anxiety, self-esteem issues, trouble forming friendships, etc. Guidance and support are very important to help them overcome these problems. So, educational institutions should have mental health professionals to help students.
__label__Evidence	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Evidence	we can't trust people to follow standards
__label__Evidence	infringing on free speech
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Evidence	capital punishment is evil in all aspect of kid's life and should be banned by law and government across the world.
__label__Evidence	zoos provide the only places for some endangered species to survive that they are essential and we should not abolish them we need to support them and their breeding programs.
__label__Evidence	The reason why I disagree is because removing the comment sections unable readers from expressing their view and opinions on certain topics covered in the newspaper.
__label__Evidence	whaling is an important cultural tradition in countries such as japan; therefore we should allow it to continue.
__label__Evidence	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Evidence	I agree. Accountability is extremly important for public confidence, so very important that this happens
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Evidence	By total scrapping of the comment section, reporters might get away with misinforming the public therefore they need to be called out right on the spot but in a respectful manner.
__label__Evidence	I agree with this statement. All hate speech can be removed if being monitored properly.
__label__Evidence	limiting executive compensation would deter executives from doing their job correctly.
__label__Evidence	it is in the constitution that there is a separation between church and state and since schools are funded by the state where they are located there is to be no prayer in schools
__label__Evidence	we should ban the use of child actors because it causes the child to be in a dangerous environment
__label__Evidence	it is a good way to instill discipline
__label__Evidence	economic sanctions do very little to "teach a lesson" and instead hurt the innocent civilians of the country.
__label__Position	i think i good to create a program that can detect key words that used in hate speech.
__label__Position	There are two groups of people. one who want to save the ecology and another group who want to exploit the environment for making money. unless strict rules are passed to stop the abuse of nature we cant save the nature and the environment
__label__Evidence	it would make prices lower for consumers
__label__Evidence	people have the right to profit from their ideas
__label__Evidence	Subsidies often make farmers in recipient countries uncompetitive, hampering local production and increasing migratory pressure.
__label__Evidence	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Evidence	As much people have freedom of speech we are also obliged to respect other people whilst doing so.
__label__Evidence	it is a fundamental right of american citizens to keep and bear arms and to remove that right would simply drive arms trading underground.
__label__Evidence	It is not about blaming others. It is about seeing the situation as it is. Recognizing patterns, reasons, and consequences of our behavior. We do not make our choices in a vacuum. If it is easier and cheaper to live not sustainably, people will do it, even if they are conscious of the consequences.
__label__Evidence	It would be smarter and cheaper to develop and encourage limited speed, low consumption shared thermal cars, and abandon the myth of owning a car.
__label__Evidence	we should ban factory farming as animals are kept in cramped conditions.
__label__Evidence	The EU should not get involved in trying to ”spread democracy” with threats and punishments, leave that to the US.
__label__Evidence	we should ban fast food because it is essentially just making obesity the most convenient lifestyle
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Evidence	Negative thought. I disagree. any effort will definitely make a difference. If hate speech is not monitored at all, racists and narcissistic people tend to grow and get away with so much
__label__Evidence	Who gets to decide what qualifies as hate speech? If I criticize someone from a protected class for their own bad behavior, what's to stop them from shielding themselves from that criticism by claming it to be hate speech?
__label__Position	The EU itself and its people should understand and accept there are a lot of Europeans outside the EU. EU does not equal to Europe
__label__Position	Businesses should buy unused emissions by reforesting, restoration, or conservation of habitats sequestrating carbon
__label__Evidence	student loan debt is crippling our young people's ability to fully participate in the economy
__label__Evidence	zoos allow animals to live in safety and to have a constant food source
__label__Evidence	Regulations fail, and extremists will point to any minor failing as strong proof of their firmly held beliefs.
__label__Evidence	we should not ban private military companies because they protect people
__label__Evidence	it's about getting the deficit down and engaging in austerity regime, the overall impact on the economy is positive in the short term
__label__Evidence	people working longer than they should prevents employers from hiring new people who might be more useful
__label__Evidence	Capitalism has empirically been shown to improve technology and drive innovation at a greater pace than economic systems that rely on collectivist practices.
__label__Position	In my opinion the comment section should not be removed. I personally get very annoyed if I watch or read something and want to express my opinion, then go down to the comment section to sadly find out the comments are turned off. This limits the freedom of speech and blocks the ability for the people to vent out somehow. I think this builds aggression and causes problems afterwards. The better thing to do is to limit bad speech, foul words and cursing but removing the comments completely is not a good idea.
__label__Evidence	We should halt all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries into the EU. However, if we want to stop this immigration, we must stop its causes. Indeed, it is war, poverty, and European, Chinese and American neo-colonialism that make the people of African and Middle Eastern countries flee to Europe. So Europe must finally take responsibility and protect these countries from corruption, war, and neo-colonialism and help them to start their economy.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Evidence	Working in sectors in ample need of workers, such as the agricultural fields, will help to integrate immigrants once their situation has been legalized. And above all, education is needed, an intensive integration education both in the language (of course) and also culture: history, philosophy, literature, etc.
__label__Evidence	too many choices in political parties separates people in a country instead of helping them to unite.
__label__Evidence	gender-neutral language is simpler and more straight forward and respects all genders without bias.
__label__Position	Online comment spaces should be platforms promoting free speech, with some restrictions in place. Human or digital moderators (AI) could be used to identify comments and phrases constituting hate speech and remove them from the platform without hindering people's ability to share their authentic views.
__label__Evidence	the olympics have long been the goal for athletes to aim for to be the very best so abolishing the games would take away their dreams and ambitions.
__label__Evidence	an austerity regime promotes the continuation and growth of a country's debt which allows dependence on others instead of addressing and repairing issues of a particular country preventing self-growth.
__label__Evidence	different people age differently so if a person can phyisically and mentally handle a job, the more power to them
__label__Evidence	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Position	Also, it is always better to do something than nothing, and then regretting it.
__label__Evidence	people should be allowed to pray wherever they want to.
__label__Evidence	trading using an algorithm is more accurate, quicker, and easier.
__label__Position	We should tax heavily or refuse to import products not manufactured in the European Union that do not comply with our climate standards
__label__Evidence	The standardized retirement age would not only be fairer in an open market, but it would also (and even more so in the future) prevent any complexities with being paid their retirement for those who have made their contributions in different Member States throughout their lives. Even though there is to be at least a central system for this (a step in the right direction), one will only receive a share of one's retirement from a particular Member State once one reaches the retirement age of that Member State.
__label__Evidence	Although there is an immense increase in the number of TCN migrant workers, there is no adequate policy in protecting their rights. Anyone in Europe should be entitled to the same worker’s rights, no matter where they come from. As migration is an issue that is dealt with by all countries, we must find a common answer at the EU level.
__label__Evidence	embryonic stem cell research is an advanced medicine progress that should not be stopped
__label__Position	We should develop Web 3.0.
__label__Evidence	the three-strikes law is good at keeping criminals off of the streets
__label__Evidence	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Evidence	This would persuade people to think about the consequences of hate speech since they will have to take responsibility with people being able to identify them.
__label__Evidence	Zoos are just a place for animals to be locked up and stared at by people.
__label__Evidence	All very good and valid points, i am in total agreement with PriceP. Very well put.
__label__Position	There is a fine line between freedom of speech and hate. And hate can be interpreted differently for different people causing biased censorship. Therefore newspapers should have moderators from both sides of opinion that overlook comments to approve before they are published
__label__Evidence	executive compensation can be come out of control.
__label__Evidence	the olympic games offer a friendly competition meeting where the best athletes around the world can come together to celebrate the best of human physical achievement.
__label__Evidence	bullying and insecurities are rampant in a teenagers world. it has very serious effects. if a little bit of plastic surgery would solve this, it should be allowed. it's worth it to prevent major emotional pain.
__label__Evidence	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Evidence	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Evidence	libertarianism leaves the poor and disadvantaged without protection from the rich and powerful
__label__Evidence	pride parades are too costly to the cities that hold them in terms of police protection and permitting
__label__Evidence	We are in a globalized world. At present, the world is running on the free flow of people, goods, services, and data. Data localization laws seem to be a part of protectionist policies, which is a threat to the free flow of data.
__label__Evidence	I disagree that newspapers should be one-sided providers. Newspapers are often aligned to certain political parties, and that is not necessarily made clear! Readers may not realise they are reading biased news stories. Comments should be allowed so that alternative points of view can also be aired.
__label__Evidence	Perhaps this would put too much power in the hands of arbiters. But if those who partake in submitting 'hate' comments were to be traced, they should end up in the Courts, not be 'educated'.
__label__Evidence	I agree
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	it is the only way we currently have to feed the masses.
__label__Evidence	compulsory voting would make sure that each and every person's voice is heard and provide a more accurate system of making sure the person elected is the one the people really want.
__label__Evidence	we should not adopt an austerity regime because people would end up with less money to pay the same amount of bills with.

__label__Evidence	economic sanctions is bullying and it will not result in the country complying or changing their policies.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Evidence	economic sanctions cause a weight on country governments that have violated human rights, dangerous acts, et al and the only thing that governments can relate to are monetary hardships.
__label__Position	Have a system that flags hate speech slurs, and then have a person or system review those comments and either allow them or remove them
__label__Evidence	We should not ban because it has been proven to work and can serve specific issues
__label__Evidence	being ban or warned has the first step
__label__Evidence	It reduces financial burden, because there is no need to buy many clothes.
__label__Evidence	Citizens should be allowed to defend themselves with lethal force in a life-or-death situation because the police are typically slow to respond to such situations.
__label__Evidence	Cosmetic surgery is important to repair damaged skin or member of people involved in an accident. This will help them regain confidence and live their life fully
__label__Evidence	The removal of the comment gives a clear warning to contributors that hate speech is not tolerated and that if they use offensive language then their opinion will not be heard.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Evidence	There is ample evidence showing that capital punishment does not constitute effective deterrence.
__label__Evidence	It should not be made known to the public that certain comments have been deleted because it discourages participation. REMOVE THEM IN SECRET.
__label__Evidence	we should subsidize student loans to ensure all who seek a good education can obtain one. this sets up success for life which also saves the government money when people are self sufficient
__label__Evidence	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Evidence	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Evidence	creative work is just as important as physical work and authors should be compensated
__label__Evidence	intellectual property rights eliminate competition which causes higher prices
__label__Evidence	legalizing the organ trade would disproportionately affect the poor, who would feel the need to sell their organs in order to make ends meet. this would also leave them physically weaker.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Evidence	if the technology exists then it should be okay to use it
__label__Evidence	cannabis has been shown to negatively affect the brain, causing psychosis and paranoia and should continue to be controlled
__label__Evidence	the olympic games inspires people around the world to take up sport and live healthier lives.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Evidence	we should end the usage of economic sanctions because it is incredibly cruel to the citizens of the country being sanctioned, especially the poor. sanctions don't necessarily stop wars either.
__label__Evidence	Protection of the rights of those who actually produce the services and products that constitutes the European market is nothing but self-evident. With a more and more integrated EU, ignoring those rights will create fragmentation and conflicts.
__label__Evidence	not allowing guns would help to keep crime down
__label__Evidence	collectivism enables communities to work together for the greater good.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Evidence	Rather than advocate for the abolition of nuclear weapons, it would be preferable if there was more nuclear proliferation, as more countries with nuclear weapons increases their deterrent effect.
__label__Evidence	journalism that is subsidized by the government will lead to censoring the media from reporting negative things about the government.
__label__Evidence	Libertarianism would end all the state run programs that people rely on.
__label__Evidence	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Evidence	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Position	IT recruiters should consider skills instead of a degree in programming
__label__Evidence	Though right to protest is a fundamental right, people do not have right to take away the fundamental rights of others such as going to their work, doing their personal works etc. Not everyone is against to the changes by government. Some people may support it and may not support the ban. Forcing them to stay at home is undemocratic.
__label__Evidence	I also don't think the removal of a comments section will make them take further, alternative action.
__label__Evidence	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Position	Nice. Your comment sums it up. Comments should be allowed to enable freedom of speech but vetted to prevent hate speeches that can invite violence amomgs the citizens
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Evidence	the use of school uniforms can eliminate many social issues among students.
__label__Evidence	Judicial activism should be limited as there should be enough statutes of law to allow for most situations and fixed punishments are more acceptable than an individuals response to a case.
__label__Evidence	we need to subsidize space exploration in order to find an inhabitable planet we can live on when we finally destroy the one we live on now.
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading enables trades to be made without spikes of emotion or rage on the part of the trader, therefore it can only be seen as positive.
__label__Position	Then we would need different names for animals, pets, and plants too. It would be ridiculous!
__label__Evidence	The Olympic games exploit people from abuse of the competitors to sex trafficking among the fans.
__label__Evidence	good journalists already make enough money to survive and their companies don't need to get more money from the government.
__label__Evidence	If all costs, including CO2 emissions of the production, the extraction of resources and its consequences for the region (environment and humans), ecosystem damage, recycling of the waste, and so on and so forth would be monetized and internalized in the costs of the products, many of our problems would be solved. It would simply make the more environmentally friendly products cheaper than the others and their production economically smarter.
__label__Evidence	If we do noting, we'll be all dead in 100 years
__label__Evidence	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Evidence	you can't govern what an individual chooses to eat
__label__Evidence	It is often very flawed and can flag up false positives
__label__Evidence	minors do not have the legal right to make that type if decision.
__label__Position	It's important that we remain a democratic society with acceptance of free speech, however it is a tricky balance between allowing free speech and the moderation of speech to prevent hate speech. I believe newspapers should be allowing comment sections, however it will be their responsibility to monitor this, and the social media website's responsibilities to monitor this on their platforms as well. How they choose to do this will depend on cost/staffing availability/bot technology, however it is an important action to take to prevent hate speech.
__label__Evidence	Accommodating refugees will cause resettling of some Indians. The Indian government tried to give shelter to Rohingyas by resettling some in the Jammu region. This may not be the right step and will cause distress to the resettled Indians.
__label__Evidence	the olympic games allow for true amateur athletes to live out their dreams.
__label__Evidence	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Evidence	We are increasingly depending on technological devices to guide us. For example, we keep reminders on smartphones and google the questions for answers. We are outsourcing the activities that require intelligence to technology. Thinking, remembering things, and analyzing are essential qualities of humans. Too much dependence on technology is making us less human.
__label__Evidence	I completely agree that education should be involved. The issue is that this doesn't have immediate affects and therefore this is why moderating the comment sections combined with education is key.
__label__Evidence	collectivism helps everyone accomplish things better.
__label__Evidence	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Evidence	financial trading is already a destructive and unethical sector of the economy and allowing algorithmic trading does not make it any less so.
__label__Evidence	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Evidence	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Evidence	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Evidence	compulsory voting would require everyone to participate in our democracy and ensure that a candidate is selected by more than just the 10 or 20 percent of the population that gets out to vote.
__label__Position	The newspaper must filter hate speech words
__label__Evidence	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Evidence	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	One alternative is the so called watching-eye effect. It is known that "under watching eyes", people tend to present less antisocial behavior, and a higher comment quality in these comment sections. Source: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0144929X.2022.2114937
__label__Evidence	I agree
__label__Position	Human Gene editing is a good thing
__label__Evidence	adults should be able to choose substances that they want to use.
__label__Evidence	a safe space is a great place for youth to hang out so that they are not in dangerous places.
__label__Evidence	The shameful policy (and practice) of Europe these days towards migrants is contradictory to the respect we need to show to fellow world citizens. And it is not in line with the fundamental rights the EU is supposed to put into practice.
__label__Position	Hate speech is always misinterpreted by very sensitive people who don't like to confront certain major issues , especially if these issues are personal to them.
__label__Position	In a survey of news sites it was found that on average 11% of comments are removed...some of these are because they are spam and some because they are offensive. I think that the fact that it's more than one in two really shows how necessary moderation is, these issues are so common. Source: https://netino.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/WAN-IFRA_Online_Commenting.pdf (pg 7)
__label__Evidence	When your beliefs are entwined with your identity, changing your mind means changing your identity. That’s really hard for most people.
__label__Position	Moderation of the comments section
__label__Evidence	religion has been used as justification for many terrible things in the past. we should base our judgements only on what we know s true, and not what might be true.
__label__Evidence	cannabis can potentially provide a route into experimenting with harder drugs.
__label__Evidence	judges are going to use their beliefs to interpret laws and we shouldn't limit that once they are elected, we should understand their views before electing them.
__label__Evidence	judicial activism should be limited as there are basic reasons why a law was put in place and a single judge should not be able to choose to ignore the basic law.
__label__Position	However there is the potential to much greater exposure to it on online than in past times. Therefore I continue to believe that greater controls on those posting comments will decrease mindless hate speech and promote constructive debate.
__label__Evidence	If newspaper columnists can publish their opinions, why can't the public enjoy the same freedoms?
__label__Evidence	targeted killing should be banned as it is no more than assassination which has always been regarded as cowardly and underhand
__label__Evidence	embryonic stem cell research may lead to life-saving treatments such as the growing of spare organs, which can save many lives.
__label__Evidence	well that would affect the credibility of the newspaper and reputation so yes it is a big responsibility to maintain spaces civilised
__label__Evidence	student loans should be subsidized to allow thos students from poorer backgrounds to get a good education and improve themselves
__label__Position	Comment spaces enhances social participation
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	it is the most efficient way to produce food
__label__Evidence	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Evidence	Moderator cannot always be reliable
__label__Position	By having comments moderated so hate speech is screened out
__label__Evidence	ceo's should not get paid thousands of times more than their workers
__label__Position	We should stop daylight saving time change
__label__Evidence	safe spaces help protect all people.
__label__Evidence	I agree, no one should migrate to a country if they're going to commit a crime.
__label__Evidence	Removing comment spaces completely reduces social participation which is super imporrant for educating others.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Evidence	space exploration is a drain on money which should be invested in looking after our own planet, therefore, we should not subsidize space explorations.
__label__Evidence	we should ban targeted killing because it condones violence.
__label__Evidence	minors should be allowed to have procedures with parental permission
__label__Evidence	we should not subsidize space exploration because there are far more important things to spend public money on closer to home such as healthcare, education and transport infrastructure
__label__Position	anati
__label__Evidence	Crimes that get the death penalty are rarely premeditated, which means capital punishment doesn't function as a deterant.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	space exploration needs our support to help us understand the universe and our place in it.
__label__Evidence	To prevent precarious conditions, we must put in place quality standards, they must be binding for all jobs created under EU and National recovery plans. Better monitoring and trade union involvement are needed to assess and report youth unemployment and NEET rates. At the moment these numbers hide forced mobility, involuntary part-time employment, and work in a grey and informal economy. Urgent measures are needed to fight youth unemployment and precarious working conditions in sectors where young people are overrepresented (tourism; gig economy...).
__label__Evidence	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Evidence	Under the IT Act, political parties do not need to disclose donations that they get below INR 20,000. An informal study done in 2010 on 6 key political parties shows that they raised Rs 700 crore. 95% of the amount was raised by amounts below Rs 20,000. There is a high possibility that the political parties use this loophole to their advantage.
__label__Evidence	we should not ban this because it is a way to get cheap, affordable food for people that may not of otherwise been able to afford it and feed their family.
__label__Evidence	It is too dangerous to allow everyone and anyone to say exactly what they like, there has to be some rules in order to protect people. It's a form of manners that we expect from each other in every day life, and should be no different just because we are online saying something.
__label__Position	We need to create a society where we can debate with each other respectfully, we can know which platforms to use and not rile each other up without offending. It is widely suggested that education can address the extent of hate speech: https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/addressing-hate-speech-through-education-global-education-ministers-conference. However, this needs to go hand in hand with moderation of sites to ensure people are kept within reason. It is not a case of any one single solution.
__label__Evidence	factory farming treats animals inhumanely, which is wrong and immoral.
__label__Evidence	while at school the focus should be on learning. prayer is a distraction and unnecessary. why not just pray before school or after?
__label__Position	I think giving particulars when you comment will help with accountability
__label__Evidence	it is inhumane and unnecessary it teaches that violence is a solution it can open the door to abuse
__label__Evidence	telemarketing is too often a waste of time. in an age where most people have ways to see who is calling, the calls rarely, if ever, actually get through. it's time to find a new way.
__label__Evidence	the right to keep and bear arms is protected by our government and should be like that so people can defend their self.
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Evidence	What does legal migration look like? People can only ask for asylum from within the EU and must officially do so at the Point of Entry. This has caused inhumane circumstances as we see at Camp Moria in Greece.
__label__Evidence	atheism offends the beliefs of most people. no one should be forced to deny their belief in god
__label__Evidence	Due to social media, now we have the opportunity to connect with many people, even if they do not live in our area. Before social media, we could interact with people from either our locality or the places we go.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Evidence	cosmetic surgery makes people feel better about themselves.
__label__Evidence	telemarketers is a good source of information about new products we could not be aware of.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars will allow people to do more instead of wasting time in traffic
__label__Position	I do not think comment sections should be completely eliminated, however they should be regularly monitored and certain words could be blocked from the comments to reduce hate speech.
__label__Evidence	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't adopt libertarianism because it means less government intervention for people that need it for example welfare
__label__Evidence	just because some people are overweight and unhealthy doesn't mean we need to ban fast food for everyone
__label__Evidence	telemarketing is very economical and it provides an easy way for companies to offer their products and services to people. telemarketers are merely asking whether someone wants something or not.
__label__Evidence	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Position	We need a minimal set of protection measures (masks, ventilation...) in public spaces and public transportation.
__label__Evidence	compulsory voting shouldn't be introduced because it violates freedom of choice.
__label__Evidence	it is a good way to control overspending and accumulating more debt
__label__Evidence	subsidising wikipedia would open it up to outside influence and could result in a deterioration in the quality of the information as those subsidising it may want information changed to make it more positive
__label__Evidence	there are people who live from this activity and you have to get a better job
__label__Evidence	the national debt is out of control and only by implementing austerity measures will we be able to reduce the budget deficit and guarantee the country's future.
__label__Evidence	it is censorship
__label__Evidence	it needs money and is used by many people.
__label__Position	We should cancel pride parades
__label__Evidence	Throughout India, many false rape cases are being registered these days. Torturing all of the accused persons causes torture to innocent persons too.
__label__Evidence	atheism gives everyone a clean slate of non belief
__label__Evidence	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Evidence	missionary work is dangerous, often occurring in war torn areas. missionaries are often young adults without world experience who are unaware of how to defend themselves in unknown lands.
__label__Evidence	there are much more important things to spend money on; space exploration is a low priority and should not be subsidized
__label__Evidence	if a person commits the same offence three times then they must be subject to the three-strikes law as they are obviously not being rehabilitated and therefore should face a long jail term.
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Evidence	a ban would only increase the already concerning trend to go to dangerous surgeons abroad
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	Respect for human rights and effort sharing, and solidarity should be common sense in EU member states. Unfortunately, they're not yet.
__label__Evidence	Autonomous cars have caused deadly accidents and they will never be safe enough for widespread public use.
__label__Position	We should ban targeted killing
__label__Evidence	we should not ban cosmetic surgery because some people need it done to improve their health and lifestyle
__label__Evidence	There are Memberstaates in the European Union, that do not want any asylum seekers in their country. For example, Denmark sends back all Syrens and other Arabians.
__label__Evidence	of all the different stem cells, embryonic have the most promise for scientific research.
__label__Evidence	some threats need to be eliminated for the public good
__label__Position	There should be more unity and cooperation in Europe.
__label__Evidence	we should not prohibit the right to pray in schools, children can opt out if they wish so prohibiting it simply unnecessarily removes the rights of those who want to participate.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Evidence	factory farming allows for increased food production for the increasing human population.
__label__Position	People do not fully understand the power of words and the affect they have on others. Removing the comments section would provide a solution but this would also limit others from giving their fair opinion. A system should rather be implemented in which hate speech can be detected and individuals held liable for their comments.
__label__Evidence	Reporters often try to make victims speak on the incident. Even in the cases of death, reporters rush to the incident and ask questions the victim's family, when they really need some space and time to grieve.
__label__Evidence	The right to keep and bear arms is a constitutional right and should never be abolished as it allows personal protection
__label__Evidence	we should not because people who are born with disfigurements have a chance to be normal.
__label__Evidence	Some of the thoughts that people need to 'clear' may offend others.
__label__Position	Research shows that letting comments proliferate with little oversight is a “dangerous recipe,” Andincivility and negative comments can have a long-term impact. Certain commenting software use algorithms meant to flag problematic comments, but machines can only do so much. Should newspapers really be spending already depleted resources on monitoring comments?
__label__Evidence	we should subsidize space exploration because it is beneficial for educational purposes
__label__Evidence	i don't agree with this - you should be able to give an opinion if it is valid and relevant.
__label__Evidence	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Evidence	we should not cancel pride parades because people have a right to have a way to voice their sexual preferences
__label__Evidence	there are more immediate needs here on earth, there's no reason to explore space. we have to care for what we have already.
__label__Evidence	Unfortunately, the values and rights are interpreted and exercised differently in the states of the European Union. Whether we are speaking about minority protection, language rights, or cultural values. We can see every day that the EU is constantly retaliating against the Hungarians in Transylvania, when, despite the legislation in force, it ignores the lawlessness and atrocities committed against the Hungarians as a native minority. Furthermore, the European Union should give priority to all situations in which Hungarians in Transylvania are victims of discrimination.
__label__Evidence	I agree with this
__label__Evidence	I agree while hate speech can be and should be monitored and removed immediately in order to reduce trauma on affected group and not to embolden other bigots. Platforms should still allow users to express opinions contrary to the creators. Peer review of reporting works well in these instances when someone goes too far - but this is also abused by with review bombing
__label__Evidence	Posting anonymously is not good. We should all be accountable to the website providers who have a duty to monitor their sites and act upon racist homophobe etc
__label__Evidence	This leaves space for people to bully and be toxic without any consequences
__label__Evidence	workers would be more motivated to do a good job if they were compensated more instead of giving the executives so much
__label__Evidence	Some newspapers already don't have comment sections on certain articles which they think would attract harmful comments or trolls.
__label__Evidence	cosmetic surgery for minors should not be banned since their right to autonomy still stands, event if it's applied by their parents (or any other legal guardian).
__label__Evidence	when we allow abortion for any reason or purpose, sex selection cannot be excluded. in fact illegal sex selection only increased abortions as the alternative method to select gender
__label__Evidence	voting is so important. voter turnout would be much higher if compulsory voting was introduced.
__label__Evidence	the defense of a country can only be trusted with the government, and should not be motivated by money and greed.
__label__Evidence	the church uses slave labor and other intimidation tactics to get what they want
__label__Evidence	The government is already in debt and subsidizing space exploration is not necessary.
__label__Evidence	better stance than removing the comments altogether
__label__Evidence	I agree
__label__Position	I believe that hate speech comments should have flagged and removed buy moderators
__label__Evidence	sometimes politics becomes so corrupt and untenable, that the only way to make change in the country is through judicial activism.
__label__Position	I'm not sure I agree with the characterisation by others here of removing comment sections on newspapers being censorship or removal of free speech. People are still able to express their opinions on the news without those opinions being actively published by the newspaper via the comment section. They can simply share on their own social media channels for example, and express their opinions there. I think if newspapers do not have the resources to moderate comment sections, this is a fair choice to make. However overall I think that larger newspapers who can sustain a moderation team have been successful in filtering out hate speech while still giving readers the opportunity to discuss and comment.
__label__Evidence	the world can not be at the mercy of a few countries with such power to destroy
__label__Evidence	legitimate prostitutes as in those not forced into the trade are hurting no one and simply providing pleasure at a cost. pleasure that some people can't get obtain any other way.
__label__Evidence	we should continue to support missionary work as they do so much good for underdeveloped countries by bring goods, medicine and skills to the people of these countries.
__label__Evidence	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Evidence	‘Fit India Movement’ may not reach the people of below poverty line. To maintain a healthy lifestyle, both physical activity and nutritious food are necessary. But in India, still many people are malnourished and some people do not have access to safe drinking water. So, without solving the issue of poverty and lack of access to affordable nutritious food, a section of people in India will not be able to take advantage of this movement.
__label__Evidence	safe spaces are a breeding ground for indoctrinators and dangerous sects
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Evidence	we should end the use of economic sanctions because they rarely achieve their desired aims while causing unitended harm to large number of people
__label__Position	I think action needs to be taken no matter what. Leaving a comment section open without any measures to combat hate speech is not a viable option. Based on this article, if left unchecked it can lead to real world violence, https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/11/30/how-online-hate-speech-is-fueling-real-life-violence/
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Evidence	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Evidence	subsidising journalism will put more resources into good investagative journalism.
__label__Evidence	One person's hate speech is another person's free speech. Who decides? It's tricky. See the attached article.
__label__Evidence	Issue with time and who gets priority for arguments
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Evidence	scientology is a cult, we need to end cults
__label__Evidence	I agree it would be a good solution better than moderators because moderators are humans and they can make mistakes.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	Without the refugee deal, the migrants will return to invade us.
__label__Evidence	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Evidence	nuclear weapons create unnecessary political tension
__label__Evidence	from exploring other planets we can learn more about our own.
__label__Evidence	executive compensation should be limited because it can be taxed as income
__label__Evidence	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Evidence	intellectual property rights should be abolished since it doesn't allow the sharing of ideas
__label__Evidence	collectivism is unfair to large populations and should be stopped
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Evidence	Its not fair, I believe its best to leave comment bar available to everyone because freedom of speech is still and thing and some who practice hate speech might be educated by another. Instead of leting one person practice hate speech elsewhere its best discussed and dealt with there and then. Something hate speech happenes dure to lack of knowledge.
__label__Evidence	seniors want to feel needed and useful so as long as they are doing a good job they shouldn't be forced to retire
__label__Evidence	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Evidence	military companies provide valuable expertise to supplement the armed forces
__label__Position	The entire nature of human rights standards and principles, as well as the ideals of tolerance, inclusiveness, and diversity, are all denied by hate speech. As a result, it may expose individuals who are the target to exclusion from social and economic opportunities, assault, and other forms of abuse. Expressions of hatred that go uncontrolled can potentially impair societal cohesiveness, peace, and development by creating the conditions for disputes, tensions, and widespread human rights abuses, including atrocity crimes. https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/impact-and-prevention/why-tackle-hate-speech
__label__Evidence	newspapers are dying and need the support.
__label__Evidence	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Evidence	as long as nuclear weapons exist, the entire world has to worry about nations deciding to fire them at another or terrorists getting hold of them and causing disaster
__label__Position	I think hate speech must be taken out.
__label__Evidence	The right to free speech doesn't mean there are no consequences for hate speech. Tolerating hate speech is not going to make it go away.
__label__Evidence	Selling organs is dangerous, leading to many deaths on the operating table.
__label__Evidence	student loans should be subsidized as this allows those from marginalized or poorer sections of society to access good education

__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__Evidence	Distance is very important when trading. Security is even more important in relation to distance. It is without thought to escalate conflict and it is not in the interest of Europe.

__label__Evidence	student loans are so unreasonibly expensive we need to help students with them.

__label__Evidence	When moderators have to approve all comments before they get posted you might create an environment where comments the moderator does not agree with do not get posted at all. The better option in my opinion would the second one where you allow readers to flag inappropriate comments, together with a moderator team reviewing these comments.

__label__Evidence	these stem cells have the potential to save millions of human lives
__label__Evidence	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Position	It is important that people are able to have a voice, especially as it can be a great tool in educating people, and giving people a variety of viewpoints that they wouldn't necessarily get to often hear. Sometimes we learn best by hearing and understanding the views of other people. We don't have to necessarily change our opinions, but it can help us become more aware of why or how people feel a certain way about things.

__label__Evidence	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Evidence	I think that people should be given the opportunity to have free speech but with people who are paid to moderate comments. Free speech should also include people being given the opportunity to say things others do not agree with as long as it is not promoting a violent crime to be committed against someone.
__label__Evidence	the use of economic sanctions should be ended because it is important to keep a good relationship with the countries we trade with.
__label__Evidence	executives have earned their compensation and should not be capped on what they can earn as this would be and overreach into company affairs

__label__Evidence	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	“Addressing hate speech does not mean limiting or prohibiting freedom of speech. It means keeping hate speech from escalating into something more dangerous, particularly incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence, which is prohibited under international law.” — United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, May 2019 This is in line with my opinion related to this topic. Escalation is the real problem that could cause serious problems, such as hate crimes.

__label__Evidence	Cosmetic surgery can have really harmful side-effects that minors can't consent to and will not be able to physically handle the way adults do.
__label__Evidence	Marvelous to see this idea of halting immigration receive the most endorsements on the migration topic. This is really not going according to plan for the globalists!
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Evidence	the development of autonomous cars is dangerous and removes human control
__label__Evidence	The situation of young people is difficult. Temporary jobs, precarious contracts, civic contracts replacing regular employment, forced self-employment, lack of basic social protection, and even age-discriminatory practices (also on the basis of age) are still the norm for millions of young people who are trying to make their way in the labor market. They need urgent help!

__label__Evidence	so moderators and filters are needed

__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.

__label__Evidence	educational policy

__label__Evidence	confining animals in small spaces is cruel.
__label__Evidence	In many ways, the debates confronting courts, legislatures, and publics about how to reconcile the competing values of free expression and nondiscrimination have been around for a century or longer. Democracies have varied in their philosophical approaches to these questions, as rapidly changing communications technologies have raised technical challenges of monitoring and responding to incitement and dangerous disinformation. United States. Social media platforms have broad latitude [PDF], each establishing its own standards for content and methods of enforcement. Their broad discretion stems from the Communications Decency Act. The 1996 law exempts tech platforms from liability for actionable speech by their users. Magazines and television networks, for example, can be sued for publishing defamatory information they know to be false; social media platforms cannot be found similarly liable for content they host.

__label__Evidence	the technology we get from space exploration alone is worth the cost of it

__label__Evidence	school uniform policies enforce yet more financial burdens on parents, are often overpriced and only available in a select few outlets which act as supply monopolies.

So, it is very important to take steps to provide affordable and high-quality medical education in India.
__label__Evidence	we should ban fast food because it is not good for people's health and they are very unhealthy in terms of calories

__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people.

__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Position	We should preserve European culture
__label__Evidence	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Evidence	while free speech is our right and we are entitled to our own opinions, when you are promoting/endorsing hatred and discrimination of any sort, the line should be drawn. having a discussion/debate with opposing sides is normal and gives insight to both sides with little bias, but that cannot be used as an excuse to be hateful or discriminatory.

__label__Evidence	school uniform requirements curtail any individual creativity and self-expression at an important age of self-discovery and should be abandoned.
__label__Evidence	The EU cannot be heaven for the entire World. The reality requires that refugees must be stopped at the border and receive only temporary shelter.

__label__Evidence	military is a big organization that needs private company to supply their needs

__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	I do think that people just comment on things even if they don't have a strong opinion about it, just because it's easy to.

__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading should be banned because it gives some people an unfair advantage.

The European project needs to benefit the many and not the few!
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Position	After having read other comments it is clear that an AI would also allow for faster moderation and removal of hate speech faster. Additionally, an AI would not be as bias as an individual may be, who would have their own ideas about what hate speech is and can be.

__label__Evidence	If the hydrogen fuel escapes into the air, it can increase global warming.
__label__Evidence	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Position	I believe we can fairly reduce hate speech by developing an algorithm to flag any potential "hate words" that may come up and then have an actaul member of staff thoroughly read the comment to determine if it was indeed hate speech or not. Also collecting indentification information can be crucial to hold the offenders responsible.
__label__Evidence	there is too much controversy surrouding the olympics such as doping, causing conflict among countries and thus, should be banned
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Evidence	I agree that restricting comments would limit hate speech
__label__Position	I feel that manmade climate change can be reversed by everyone working together and making sacrifices to improve the environment. It will be made possible by people figuring out ways to save on carbon emissions instead of taking the easiest route. If we can do that in more ways than one, we should be able to save the planet.
__label__Evidence	minors don't have the forethought and capacity to make decisions about permanent procedures. they cant fully think through the consequences of plastic surgery. many may end up regretting it.
__label__Position	we need to stop coment section
__label__Evidence	Good idea, however the elimination of hateful words won't completely eliminate hate speech altogether (ex. people can use alternate language)
__label__Evidence	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Evidence	If people make a revolution for our system and values, we must support them. It is the Ukrainian people who decide their future, not Russia. In order to support them we need a European army and a common foreign policy.
__label__Evidence	Less restricted could mean allowing one comment per user or capping the amount of characters that can be used. I see this a fair
__label__Evidence	the two-party system is outdated and has proven, lately, that it does not always result in the best possible candidates.
__label__Evidence	It can be difficult to monitor everything all the time, but I think if something is reported and not deleted then fair enough.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Evidence	a zoo is a safe place for animals who lost their homes and are not able to care for themselves
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Evidence	we would end up in bidding wars where only the rich could be helped
__label__Evidence	this helps traders make more informed decisions
__label__Evidence	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Evidence	Flagging comments would be good
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Evidence	Freedom of speech should never be taken away.
__label__Evidence	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Position	Conversations need to be moderated
__label__Evidence	I agree with both of these ideas. Having a moderation means consistency, but having other readers flag comments allows other commenters to hold peers to account and ensure that the comment section is an inclusive and fair section.
__label__Evidence	judicial activism should be limited to avoid violence among the opposition.
__label__Evidence	humans don't have the right to play god with genetics
__label__Position	No one should be able to post hate speech comments or remarks. There must be moderations in place that regulate such comments and conduct.
__label__Evidence	we have a separation of church and state and the state runs the public schools.
__label__Evidence	the people doing the real work are the regular associates and executives shouldn't get rewarded for someone else's work
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Position	With the increase of humans on our planet, we need to understand resources are finite and adapt.
__label__Evidence	it would take a lot of time before the news are released
__label__Evidence	whaling kills whales in an inhumane way
__label__Evidence	pride parades cause more trouble by singling out those who are different.
__label__Evidence	I agree that in removing hate speech there is a chance that we could be silencing valid criticism and curtailing freedom of speech. However, I do think that sometimes there can be a fine line between criticism and hate speech and I would much rather see valid criticism removed than to see hate speech spread.
__label__Position	The newspaper website platform owners should be held accountable for any hate speech that occurs on their website and they can combat hate speech allowing fellow readers to be able to flag/report posts that they deem hateful.The moderators can then investigate.
__label__Evidence	if people want to get work done it is their choice
__label__Evidence	prostitution is catering for an age-old need, and legalising the profession will improve the safety and health of the sex workers.
__label__Evidence	the three-strikes law is unfair to those whose crimes are minimal verses those whose crimes are very bad.
__label__Evidence	factory farming provides for lower cost foods to be sent to the consumer, allowing for ease of access to goods by those with minimal incomes.
__label__Evidence	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Evidence	Non-trustworthy news sources and fake news stories abound. We must subsidize investigative journalism in order to ensure we have reliable news sources that report real facts.
__label__Evidence	school uniforms are a way of stifling the creativity and individuality of students.
__label__Position	We should eliminate the outdated agricultural subsidies
__label__Position	While hate speech and offensive language are quite difficult concetpts to pin down, there are topics which are considered by law such as recism, xenophobia, anti-semitism, etc. Some form of moderation could start there.
__label__Evidence	We should not legalize prostitution because prostitution is coercive and given a free choice and maximum information, almost no rational person would become a prostitute.
__label__Evidence	there is no one right belief for all people and insisting that everyone is a libertarian deprive free choice
__label__Evidence	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Evidence	We should not abolish the right to keep and bear arms as we have a right to defend ourselves given by the constitution.
__label__Evidence	children should be allowed to have a procedure if they have their parents permission
__label__Evidence	libertarianism gives us real freedom and keeps the government out of our lives
__label__Evidence	collectivism makes people lazy. why work hard if other people will do it for you? we should encourage individualism instead where people are encouraged to be innovative and hard working.
__label__Position	To reduce hate speech newspaper websites should employ content moderators who can look out for hate speech and delete it where necessary. This allows for there to still be a comment section for readers to put their opinions in.
__label__Evidence	The death penalty can provide families of victims with some closure, which may help them to deal with their suffering.
__label__Position	Climate change will never be reversible, humans are humans and far to many either do not believe it is happenings or cannot find the time to do any thing about it. As it goes now life on earth will be in jeopardy before my grand kids get to be my age.
__label__Evidence	If a veto is happening in the current EU voting procedure it is justified.
__label__Evidence	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Evidence	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Evidence	cannabis can be used for a number of medical issues so making it legal will help with that
__label__Evidence	the software might fail
__label__Evidence	I disagree with this. Previous to social media and comment sections, newspapers often printed responses from readers. Journalists and those giving opinion pieces should face scrutiny and feedback from readers.
__label__Evidence	stem cell research will encourage more abortions
__label__Evidence	telemarketing allows consumers to hear information about products they might might not otherwise have the opportunity to learn about.
__label__Evidence	We should abolish the Olympic Games because they have become very open to abuse in terms of drug use and oppressive government regimes.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	if we got rid of three-strikes laws, there would be little deterrent for career criminals.
__label__Evidence	We should support collectivism because there would be fewer homeless people or starving people if people of means took a community interest rather than one of pure greed.
__label__Evidence	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Evidence	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Evidence	sex selection could lead to an imbalance of genders
__label__Evidence	safe spaces equal non-free speech spaces and that is against the law.
__label__Evidence	subsidizing journalism would help crowd out the every increasing false news market. if the false news market could not compete with legitimate news, less people would be exposed to dangerous false news.
__label__Evidence	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Evidence	collectivism can cause people to ignore important problems if it doesn't apply to certain groups

__label__Position	Refrigerants currently cause emissions throughout their life cycles, but 90 percent of emissions happen at disposal.
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Evidence	If we adopted libertarianism the country would be more peaceful as everyone would just be allowed to do whatever they feel is right.
__label__Evidence	student loans shouldn't be subsidized because you're limited in the amount that you can borrow

__label__Position	The debate can be seen in the discussion here: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21670811.2020.1837638
__label__Evidence	yes. good moderators are the key
__label__Evidence	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Evidence	Removing them removes those concerns and creates a more positive website experience for the reader
__label__Evidence	I like this idea - there could also be a warning system for those reading the comments, if something does get published that possibly shouldn't have. A warning stating that the following comment may be offensive and contain hate speech.
__label__Evidence	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Evidence	Executives put more of their time, effort and life to put their company at the top. This effort really merits to be recognized. Only through a high compensation is their efforts be recognized
__label__Evidence	people's jobs depend on whaling, there is a whole industry which would be destroyed if whaling was banned, resulting in hardships for whole communities.

__label__Evidence	whaling shuld be banned because it is a cruel and outdated practice & no longer serves a purpose

__label__Position	Put in word blocks and monitor the use of the comment section a lot more.
__label__Evidence	nuclear weapons are a symbol of power and strength that can prevent other countries from attacks, giving us a place as a world power.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	it should not be legal, it is costly and morally wrong
__label__Evidence	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Evidence	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Evidence	We need the United States of Europe. A European army, strategic autonomy, and acting as one. To the future of Europe must belong its capacity to act as a global player.
__label__Position	https://www.e-marketingassociates.com/blog/the-importance-of-monitoring-social-media-comments - This stresses the importance of monitoring comments as it has both positives for us and positives for these newspaper companies. Not only does hate crime harm individuals but it can harm the business who allow hate crime to be associated with their platform. It is necessary and okay for people to have opinions however morally we should draw a line and know where we stand on right and wrong
__label__Evidence	judicial activism shouldn't be limited because it allows judges to rule in favor of the right thing regardless if the current laws are obstructing said behavior. this is essential for democracy.
__label__Evidence	we should not end the use of economic sanctions because in the long term they can achieve significant results such as the end of the apartheid regime in south africa
__label__Evidence	Changing the EU foreign policy voting procedure will cause serious problems.
__label__Evidence	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Evidence	prostitution is a means for low income or low skills people to earn extra money to get by.
__label__Evidence	it would give focus to the journalism.
__label__Evidence	Freedom of speech
__label__Evidence	Hi Fabio, I believe you are absolutely right. Comments should definitely be allowed but under some kind of regulation. Not all comments are useful or relevant.
__label__Evidence	the military is the last thing that should be profit driven, reliance on such companies can invoke catastrophe.
__label__Evidence	maintaining intellectual property rights for all is too expensive, and maintaining these rights might restrict innovation in certain sectors.
__label__Evidence	It would be easier if the EU joined NATO. The internal rivalry between the single EU states would stop. Also, the issue of a legitimate European army would be solved. However, I am not sure how this would work out in legal terms. Federations have already joined NATO, rather than individual states, but what would be the status of the EU?
__label__Evidence	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Evidence	I think people are completely aware that they are spouting 'hate' messages, they just don't care. Education is a total waste of time. They are bullies.
__label__Position	I'm having trouble reading the comments on here. The page keeps moving. I can only confirm what I have already written that comments should be allowed but would have to be moderated in some way. I don't know how this would happen, since there could be too many comments for a human to police. Perhaps a combination of a bot checking comments and a real human might work. I don't think you will completely eliminate hate speech because everyone has different life experiences. It should be up to the individual to realise what makes sense instead of enforcing a kind of nanny state. People should be able to make up their own minds. The issue happens when you become the target and how it can affect you personally. However, I still believe that we need freedom of speech and the only way to stop it is to police the comments and discourage by criminalising it to empower victims. This article looks at both sides:- https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation
__label__Evidence	Think this is a great idea to flag comments as inappropriate to alert moderators.
__label__Evidence	journalism provides a needed check on the government.
__label__Position	I believe it is fair for hate speech comments to be censored, because it could lead to violent public behavior.
__label__Position	Every year that passes we lose tools or opportiunities that could work to counteract climate change as well as more damage is added - therefore is -unfortunately- irrevrsible
__label__Evidence	often females prostitutes are vulnerable and have drug and alcohol problems. they are only prostitutes because they are desperate.
__label__Evidence	multi-party systems slow down what gets done because we have too many different sides trying to come to an agreement
__label__Position	I have read through some of the cooments and my stance is still the same. It is no doubt that hate speech is a problem, however, not allowing the public the opportunity to comment on issues may not only be a problem against freedom of speech, it may also cause the newspaper to lose some of its loyal readers if they're not able to engage with the content shared by the newspaper.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Evidence	the church of scientology is known for trying to completely control the thoughts and actions of others
__label__Evidence	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Evidence	Multiculturalism creates chaos wherever it exists. Sweden's Stockholm has become the Rape Capital of the West, and the number of bombs and shootings has skyrocketed as well in that country. France is bordering on civil war, whole territories are not under state control anymore. Europe needs to stop migration and asylum indefinitely. We need to put our European peoples first, much like the entire world is doing while our civilization is committing suicide based on values imposed by sanctimonious narcissists.
__label__Evidence	Some people could cloud hate speech as 'open mindedness' and use it as a way to push their agenda without taking responsibility.
__label__Evidence	school uniform limits the ability of young people to develop their identity and express who they are
__label__Evidence	AI is a great option that would reduce the need for manpower and increase the efficiency and speed in which hate speech is addressed.
__label__Evidence	pride parades are a way for people to come together and celebrate being themselves and shouldn't be cancelled.
__label__Evidence	Three strikes laws increase violence against law enforcement since an accused criminal facing the potential for a life sentence is more likely to fight back against law enforcement to escape.
__label__Position	having a screener in the background conrtolling everything thats coming in and also comment section
__label__Position	I believe that if there was a program that could trace the people who are committing this crime and them getting punishment from the government law, it would reduce the hate speech. The problem is that people think they can get away. maybe this link can help: https://pmg.org.za/page/Prevention%20and%20Combating%20of%20Hate%20Crimes%20and%20Hate%20Speech%20Bill%20&%20International%20Crimes%20Bill:%20briefing,%20with%20Minister%20and%20Deputy%20Minister
__label__Evidence	That is a very minimalistic view as there could be many words that get missed and what happens if someone uses normal words that make a hateful sentence
__label__Position	There are various articles and booklets on the internet, freely available, giving recommendations as to how online sites and mdia sites can reduce hate speech. This one says the following ''Social media companies and other internet intermediaries have a legal and ethical responsibility to take effective measures to reduce the dissemination of prohibited hate speech on their digital platforms and to address its consequences. This includes, where appropriate, content moderation'' It seems they are suggesting that all sites that allow public comment should preferably engage moderators to sift out extreme and obscene comments. I think, really, this is the best that can be done without curtailing free speech. Link jere to recomeedations https://www.idi.org.il/media/13570/recommendations-for-reducing-online-hate-speech.pdf
__label__Position	you cant, by reducing hate speech you are eliminating free speech
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Evidence	three strike laws perpetuate the for profit prison industrial complex and don't actually address the underlying issues driving people to commit crimes
__label__Position	Reading the comments below, I do agree that people should be allowed to write their opinions online but I also agree that there is should be any kind of regulation that avoids hate speech. It has been discussed and shown over the years the impact of what is said on the internet in mental health. So I think it is time to be more restrict with alghoritms and detect certain keywords that are a red flag.
__label__Evidence	But will that be effective?
__label__Evidence	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Evidence	people should not be forced to vote if they don't feel compelled to vote for a candidate or issue..
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Evidence	I agree, but trolls want to be trolls if they wanted to be trolls. People should be held accountable as well.
__label__Evidence	check-balancing government use of power in a democracy is what makes democracy the better governing form. judicial activism will limit government overuse of its power
__label__Evidence	we should adopt gender-neutral language to make sure everyone is included
__label__Evidence	we should ban cosmetic surgery for minors because society is making an unrealistic view on children and expecting them to grow up too quickly.
__label__Evidence	the thing is people always find a way to say those certain words.
__label__Evidence	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Evidence	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Evidence	I strongly agree with your opinion, however the reader comments need to be respect as a platform despite people having the right to freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	it is a form of harassment to be contacted constantly by telemarketers.
__label__Position	COVID-19 vaccination should be made mandatory
__label__Position	Educate youth about the concequences of hate speech
__label__Evidence	collectivism utilizes the best from many sources
__label__Evidence	No one individuals life is any more intrinsically important or valuable than any other person's life, and therefore we should build societies that value the collective and general public over the individual.
__label__Evidence	a multi-party system allows a greater freedom of choice for voters to express their democratic right to vote for policies they would like to implimented.
__label__Evidence	It would still need to be moderated as the users can radicalise themselves
__label__Evidence	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Evidence	too many child actors can't handle the pressure and end up turning to drugs and other crimes to cope.
__label__Evidence	a multi-party system could add more complexity and create situations where issues become impossible to resolve.
__label__Evidence	mandatory retirement should be ended as it is unfair on older people.
__label__Evidence	Missionary work has helped to civilize entire socities.
__label__Evidence	wikipedia often contains false information and so can lead to people believing that have no validity in reality.
__label__Evidence	legalizing cannabis as far as health is concerned can be beneficial since many of these substances are used as treatments for certain diseases
__label__Evidence	School uniform is adequate. It is useful for leveling people social position and for children concentration in class
__label__Evidence	In a collectivist society, everyone is considerate of each another and provides support to one another.
__label__Evidence	At present, many countries are refusing refugees stating that they pose an economic or security threat. Only a few countries including Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, and Liberia are accepting most of the refugees. Some host countries are forcibly sending refugees back to their home countries stating that such as the situation in their home countries is safe. Many refugees who were sent like this went through brutal violence and some people even disappeared.
__label__Position	i believe that to permanently reduce comments about hate speech, the space for readers comments has to be eliminated, otherwise we will never completely reduce hate speech unless the platform for that hate speech is permanently removed.
__label__Evidence	this is true opinion is important
__label__Evidence	cosmetic surgery should be allowed for minor because they may need surgery from an accident or from a deformity that can be fixed before they are old enough to suffer from it.
__label__Position	All readers have the right to freedom of speech, which is protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. However, incitement of violence is not protected by The First Amendment. Since there are no laws regarding hate speech in the constitution - you cannot fairly censor or hide comments unless they are inciting violence.
__label__Evidence	they lead to an inconvenience to road users
__label__Position	Using an algorithm is the best solution.
__label__Evidence	they are expensive to whoever hosts them
__label__Position	More emphasis on moderation of specific language would reduce the risk of hate speech. Also, moderators approving comments before they appear on the website would help.
__label__Evidence	But with freedoms we have to consider the repsonsibilities that come along with those. Your frredoms dont give you a right to infringe uopn anothers right by discriminating agaisnt them. Majority of constituions talk about freedoms and right but we cannot be only selfish and forget about anothers right to freedom and dignity.
__label__Position	Conservation of resources may end up where it's eventually undone by someone who takes them, as nature doesnt like a void.So climate change can be neutral at best and getting worse at worst with this principle.
__label__Evidence	Some feedback is sometimes good for the growth of the newspaper website
__label__Evidence	We need to accept more immigrants to combat the aging of the European population. Immigrants do also grow old but before then they generally have children.
__label__Evidence	if a child wants to act they have every right to
__label__Evidence	While yes we should all be able to communicate freely, with the anonymity of the internet internet trolls go too easily unpunished and their actions not removed
__label__Evidence	Three-strike laws lead to expensive trials. Three-strike offenders will demand a court trial rather than accept a plea bargain (which costs a fraction of the price of a full-blown trial).
__label__Evidence	Yes but it can also reduce the preaching of misinformation and hateful ideologies
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Evidence	Migration is part of being human and has always happened throughout history.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars will never work and the development of said cars should be stopped. there are too many complex situations that will cause more crashes than what is currently happening.
__label__Evidence	we should not ban a food simply because it is quick to buy! we can tax or ban the harmful components like saturated fat, and actually target the issue rather than indiscriminately target the convenience.
__label__Evidence	I think people may give false information (data)
__label__Evidence	The EU needs a humane, civilized, and legal way to manage migration, whether it is for economic reasons or to seek international protection.
__label__Evidence	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Evidence	judicial activism lets judges give the final verdict based on feelings so they will have the power to let things slide and give people less sentences than they deserve
__label__Position	Hate speech can and does stop genuine free speech. This article implores us not to read the comments as they can stifle the voices of minorities. https://theconversation.com/dont-read-the-comments-misinformed-and-malicious-comments-stifle-indigenous-voices-180576
__label__Evidence	It is important to give everyone a point of view and allow them a space to voice it, within reason.
__label__Evidence	this is needed in areas where the population is unequal. when only one sex is the majority, that population would eventually cease. there wouldn't be enough mates.
__label__Position	Public opinions on factual media outlets are inappropriate - Forums are are a more appropriate area for opinions and would be simpler to moderate
__label__Evidence	In a multi-party system, parties are more easily manipulated by the political agendas of different groups.
__label__Evidence	the three-strikes laws helps deter people from committing further crimes
__label__Evidence	we should adopt a multi-party system because we need more than one opinion to round out solutions.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Evidence	not difficult, would say need more work and maybe more money spent in discovering something new
__label__Position	Hate comments are always not good for any person
__label__Evidence	fast food is unhealthy for us with its ingredients and the way its made
__label__Evidence	Frontex interfering with the national border guards doing their sacred duty to protect the border, and then sending anonymous reports to criticize these brave men and women is quite abhorrent.

__label__Evidence	school uniforms cost a lot and might not be affordable for everyone
__label__Evidence	Austerity regime is important for maintaining only important spending from government when their is lack of economic growth in the country. It helps in cutting useless spending and revitalize the economy
__label__Evidence	This closes the possibility of healthy debate and non-hate speech.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	we should not legalize the organ trade because it would lead to the exploitation of the poor for the benefit of the rich
__label__Evidence	we should not ban cosmetic surgery for minors as some minors are born with defects that could be corrected by these procedures.

__label__Evidence	The EU is driving in the dark with the lights switch off.

__label__Evidence	banning cosmetic surgery is like banning freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	I agree with the comment but the link provided is quite biased and one sided.

__label__Evidence	whaling provides a lot of income for people that would then become unemployed if they couldn't do it anymore.
__label__Evidence	we cannot ban things just because you don't like them. factory farms help get the most food per acre.
__label__Position	I think all comments should be moderated. Otherwise people can post things which are untrue and these comments are spread to other forums by people who don't realise they are untrue.
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Position	We should shift the EU policy toward the Russian Federation
__label__Evidence	cosmetic surgery can sometimes cause harm and disasterous results.
__label__Position	https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-and-real-harm
__label__Position	I think most of us share a unanimous idea which is that restricting the comments section is not so beneficial in the long run, and that internal measures can be taken to deal with the issue of hate speech . This article shows how hate speech can be effectively tackled https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/impact-and-prevention/why-tackle-hate-speech
__label__Evidence	Many of the most horrendous acts by humanity has been done in the name of religion, the world would be a more peaceful place if we all adopted atheism.
__label__Evidence	Mandatory retirement helps combat unemployment among young people.

__label__Evidence	Technology may increase to where it can be - like developing time travel.
__label__Evidence	we should ban missionary work to avoid danger to themselves especially if they are doing their missionary work in a dangerous part of the world
__label__Evidence	cannabis provides many benefits, including soothing the pain of people that are ill. the fact that it is still illegal is outdated and should be changed.
__label__Evidence	The "perfect" beauty teens aspire to achieve with cosmetic surgery isn't real. Pictures in magazines are often airbrushed or photo-shopped - or otherwise enhanced.
__label__Evidence	The most misused law in the Indian judicial system is Section 498A, which allows women to file a case on a husband and his family in case of dowry harassment. Many women are using this law to extort money and property from their in-laws. If the law on marital rape comes into effect, many innocent men will be at threat.
__label__Evidence	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Position	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries
__label__Evidence	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Evidence	scientology is not a real religion and you can't just take a work of sci-fi and make your own religion
__label__Evidence	I leave a link to the study: https://mediaengagement.org/research/journalists-and-online-comments/
__label__Evidence	Industries are also one of the worst hits. Investors may lose interest to invest in manufacturing sector as bandh by anyone results in the loss to them.
__label__Evidence	cannabis is considered a soft drug and has been shown to be successful in the treatment of range of mental and physical illnesses. legalizing it reduces the criminality associated with its distribution
__label__Evidence	Migration from countries with incompatible cultural values and ideologies should be limited or stopped to ensure social cohesion in Europe. Regressive outdated ideologies and values should have no place in Europe.
__label__Evidence	an austerity regime would help to get our country back on a solid financial footing.
__label__Evidence	I agree it is an individual's responsiblity to choose their words carefully, and if they don't then their comments, or eventually if they persist, their accounts should be removed.
__label__Evidence	I find your view hateful.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

__label__Evidence	it is very difficult to define and identify and intellectual property.
__label__Evidence	every individual should be able to choose whether or not they want to vote
__label__Evidence	Social media companies are already using AI to do this and news platform should approach it in the same way - https://www.newsy.com/stories/artificial-intelligence-is-used-to-track-down-hate-speech/
__label__Evidence	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Evidence	We should support collectivism because people have more freedom when they are supported in their choices than when they have to scramble for everything on their own.
__label__Position	There will always be a few bad apples in a batch just as there will always be bad people among humanity. Honestly the easiest method of combatting this issue is through the utilization of manual review teams perhaps hired by the newspaper or even paid through revenue made by the articles failing that approach bots can be instantiated with the programmed capability of removing comments that have flagged contents inside them.
__label__Evidence	we cannot infringe the right to free association, even when we don't agree with the organization.
__label__Evidence	animals can live comfortably in zoo's compared to other animals losing their homes because of human actions
__label__Evidence	child actors become adults far too quickly and should not be allowed to act until they are adults
__label__Position	Maybe filter through comments
__label__Evidence	but doesn't the detection ai get better at filtering the more it works?
__label__Position	The most effective way would be to produce effective and fair algorithms that can detect use of hate speech along with help of human moderation.
__label__Position	The EU needs a more rational Green Policy
__label__Evidence	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?

__label__Evidence	pride parade has become a symbol of freedom and embracing difference for everyone, not just the LGBT community
__label__Position	There should be a federal Constitution for a European Federation
__label__Evidence	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Evidence	libertarianism runs roughshod over every collective and communal human right and entitlement. privileged individuals prosper whilst the rest of society suffers. it should most definitely not be adopted
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	Not allowing anonymous posts as well would force individuals to process comments internally before publishing on a public platform.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Position	Conservation of resources may end up where it's eventually undone by someone who takes them, as nature doesnt like a void.So climate change can be neutral at best and getting worse at worst with this principle.

__label__Evidence	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button
__label__Evidence	I agree with your idea. But it is a long and arduous way to reach the goal. What's the point of building a skyscraper without a foundation? What I mean by that: First the EU needs a unified foreign policy and only then a common and united army.
__label__Evidence	if we just hold up our beliefs, we will find that libertarianism helps us defend our rights as citizens of this country.
__label__Evidence	Does not allow for positive feedback
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Evidence	we should abolish the right to keep and bear arms because innocent people get killed
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Position	Another alternative is to turn our attention towards what 'Free speech' really means and consider re-wording or amending the constitution. This however is requires changes at a government level.
__label__Evidence	collectivism necessarily means that individual freedoms will be reduced, so it does not make sense to adopt it.
__label__Position	I don't think removing the comment spaceis a good idea, people should still be given a platform where they can voice themselves out. Having a team look through the comments and find those that include hate speach and remove them and maybe ban the people whith hatespeach comments from ever posting comments again.
__label__Position	https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-63291527
__label__Position	Educate people that people are loosing hope when they need help and some people are busy commenting with hate speech

__label__Evidence	the brain of a child isn't fully developed and it isn't fair to have such harsh penalties on them
__label__Evidence	Libertarianism would cause chaos in a large country as there would be no set rules and regulations.
__label__Evidence	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Position	Should be reviewed first before it gets published
__label__Evidence	prostitution is a dangerous profession
__label__Evidence	With entropy, all efforts to restore the atmospheric gas balance will still leave a lot of the changes to the worldfor a very long time.Mitigation might be all we can do at this point,rather than being able to fully reverse it.
__label__Evidence	better education is good for the nation
__label__Evidence	Achieving excellence in anything takes time. Through graduation, students gain so much knowledge in the relevant field. So, it’s easier for employers to train these students for the industrial requirements.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Evidence	Critical discussions are essential to democratic nations
__label__Position	Comment space encourages discussion of important topics and allows free exchange of information and so should not be eliminated. Independent moderators should be used in order to ensure that hate speech is quickly deleted and encourage users to express their ideas without using inappropriate or aggressive language.

__label__Evidence	the capital punishment is a setback of the current civilization

__label__Evidence	we should not subsidize embryonic stem cell research as that is done by private companies and they can raiser their own money.

__label__Evidence	prostitution is a noble work for women finding it hard to secure a job in this world becoming more and more hard and difficult
__label__Evidence	However, we need a solution for this, else we may not be able to have any platforms at all.

__label__Evidence	zoos are good source of information for the public to learn about animals up close
__label__Evidence	no subsidy should be given to wilkpedia. it is part of the free enterprise system and can be supported by users and advertisers.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Position	By having a system that detects bad or hate speech comments
__label__Position	Yes that could also help
__label__Evidence	All wrong. Let everyone decide for himself (or herself). Forcing women into specific positions is bad ... and sexist I guess.
__label__Position	regulations and setting values is the most paramount phase to consider when planning to eliminate hate speech from newspapers websites which clearly state that should anyone go beyond these rules will then be held accountable .
__label__Evidence	There are alternatives to killing stray animals. Sterilization and culling instead of killing them can solve the problem.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	I agree
__label__Evidence	when someone comes up with an idea it is their idea. they should be the one to profit from that idea. other people shouldn't be able to just take it and make it their own.
__label__Evidence	it is only fair that a person or company that created something should have protections against those that want to make money off of another's hard work.
__label__Position	It is obvious that something needs to be put in place to reduce online hate speech in comment sections. The below article shows how this can manifest as realworld hatred and violence. Surely newspapers have the obligation to step up and do something about this. https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/11/30/how-online-hate-speech-is-fueling-real-life-violence/
__label__Evidence	A humanitarian association that helps a migrant to enter the EU illegally, should be required to provide financial support in dignified conditions.

__label__Evidence	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	I agree that the only way to ensure balanced discussion without allowing hate or eliminating genuine responses is through moderation of comments before posting
__label__Evidence	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Evidence	Some companies are building strategies to use their apps for a longer time, to keep us addicted to their apps and devices so that they can show advertisements to us. And also they can use our data to manipulate our decisions for their profits. These strategies are turning humans into just targets.
__label__Evidence	collectivism takes care of everyone and not just those at the top
__label__Evidence	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Evidence	the new generations need the opportunity to advance in their preparation, that is why if they do not have the means and the state does not provide free education then it should promote means such as loans.
__label__Evidence	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Position	Perhaps moderators could be required to act proactively (approving posts before they're public) rather than reactively (deleting etc).
__label__Evidence	we should ban algorithmic trading because trading on such a large scale across many markets can increase the financial risk and has been blamed for market crashes.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Evidence	Every child is different. Homeschooling allows to design the curriculum based on the student's capabilities and interests.
__label__Evidence	we should subsidize space exploration because someday we may have to leave earth behind once we deplete all our resources or because of a nuclear war.
__label__Evidence	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Evidence	There need to be some rules for integration:Integration does not mean giving up European values and culture.
__label__Position	Some damage towards the climate is currently irreversible to prevent reversal in time.
__label__Evidence	we should not ban missionary work because otherwise, people would not know what the bible means. they may not ever be exposed to the information at all if there were not missionaries.
__label__Evidence	Legalizing prostitution would result in an increased number of women being forced into sex slavery. It would also make it harder to hunt down traffickers.
__label__Position	We should ban the Church of Scientology
__label__Evidence	Some would argue it removes their right of freedom of speech. Despite whether it is of hateful intent or not.
__label__Position	Organ donation should be made compulsory
__label__Evidence	legalizing prostitution would lead to it being more regulated, therefore, safer to any participants.
__label__Evidence	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Evidence	I think adding chat bans for repeat offenders of hate speech could help.
__label__Position	Hate speech is something people intentionally and so if people continue to participate in it, they should be punished.
__label__Evidence	the most obvious reason to oppose is the danger that an innocent person is killed due to the fact that mistakes are made. witnesses can be wrong in what they saw and lawyers can make a hash of defending a case.
__label__Evidence	This is just evidence. Immigration will be one of the most difficult topics in the next decades (or even years) due to the insane demographic rates the world is suffering nowadays, so immigration has to be closely monitored and all illegal immigration has to be blocked.
__label__Evidence	The EU should acknowledge the fact that increasing birth rates in Europe, and supporting European families to have (more) children is the most appropriate long-term solution.
__label__Evidence	Legalizing prostitution will allow prostitutes to push for equitable contracts and conditions, something they can't do in the status quo since their work is illegal.

__label__Evidence	pride parades are important for gay people and allow them to get their message across to the wider community.
__label__Evidence	mandatory retirement is discrimination against older people who may still have something of value to contribute to society.
__label__Evidence	The prices of fossil fuels are increasing continuously. So, if more hydrogen vehicles come into the market, the price of fossil fuels may reduce.
__label__Position	Allowing other members to flag comments for you could be very helpful as it cuts down on having moderators soft through everything. Good people usually are very helpful in flagging up hate speech.
__label__Evidence	embryonic stem cell research could potentially save millions of lives and needs as much support as it can get.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Position	I disagree with the idea that hate speech is free speech as nothing that perpetuates targetted violence should be done freely without consequence.People on the internet need to watch what they say the same way they would when engaged in a conversation in the real world.For those that choose to not adhere it is imperative that they are removed from these platforms and banned from creating other accounts.
__label__Position	The EU should have open borders with poor countries
__label__Evidence	people should be able to assess the risks of eating fast food themselves
__label__Position	I think we firstly have to call out hate speech in order for people to learn that it is not okay and unacceptable. The reason being online 'haters' tend to abuse their right to free speech such that it infringes upon the next person because they have the comfort of knowing that nobody will find put who they really are and confront them. By calling out users on the newspaper website and responding to their comment as the moderator of the comments, and actually suspending their accounts because of it can go a long way.
__label__Evidence	factory farming treats live animals as a disposable item
__label__Position	A difficult question and I don't believe there is an easy solution.
__label__Position	We should create a pan-European train company
__label__Evidence	being lgbt is against many large religions, people should not be forced to witness such parades because of such.
__label__Position	Is it necessary to have readers comments? What do they add to the article?
__label__Evidence	we should not ban missionary work because people have a right to help out others if they chose to do so
__label__Position	Moderation is necessary. Closing comments is not the answer, as communication can help people to understand each other's viewpoints. If you take comments away because you're afraid of hate speech, you're going to be creating a barrier between you and your audience.
__label__Evidence	Every nation with its own language and culture, which demands the same status as a sovereign nation within Europe, must have the right to be recognized and respected by people and other member nations/states.
__label__Evidence	I wholeheartedly agree. Securing our neighbors and allies has to be a priority. The only thing that causes me some dismay is Turkey being a part of NATO. It was a good idea in 1951 but clearly, Turkey must be out off the map now.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspapers websites. One way is to create a system where readers can flag articles that contain hate speech. Another way is to have a team of moderators who review articles before they are published.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

__label__Evidence	space exploration is not yielding anything useful to society and should not be subsidized.
__label__Position	no, after all news paper should represent freedom of speech
__label__Evidence	After a daily 10-hour shift from Monday to Friday most of us prefer to stay at home on the holidays. We surround ourselves with laptops, TV, and mobile and use them in cycles for Netflix, sports, social media, etc. (thinking that we are relaxing) rather than going out. We prefer and are more comfortable with online chatting instead of talking to people for real. There are fewer meaningful relationships nowadays because of all the above factors. We have started preferring isolation.
__label__Evidence	fast food is high in calories and causes obsesity
__label__Evidence	factory farming causes untold unnecessary suffering to animals. they are too crowded, do not have room to move or even breathe properly.
__label__Evidence	Due to the inactive lifestyle and stressful lives, many people are getting lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, etc. Fit India Movement can encourage people to consume healthy food and maintain physical and mental fitness.
__label__Position	Comments are important as they allow other people to express their views but at the same time it can be a problem when we have to deal with inconsiderate individuals.
__label__Evidence	It gives them freedom of speech and a chance to express themselves.
__label__Evidence	Reality shows give opportunity for children to bring out their hidden talents and to train their skills. It gives them a sense of purpose and direction from a very young age. The present education system doesn’t include other career options such as singing, acting, dancing, games, etc. Reality shows closes this loophole in the education system.
__label__Evidence	As Europe bears the burden of the XXth century authoritarian regimes (right and left) and saw their children ideologically possessed by fascist and communist governmental propaganda (Hitlerjugend (right) and Pioneer (left) movements), we need to limit the access of the children - as one of the most vulnerable groups of our community - to every political ideology and propagating associations.
__label__Evidence	cosmetic surgery for minors will only cause kids to get surgery to meet an impossible standard of looks and beauty.
__label__Evidence	we need to explore space so we can find minerals that are getting depleted on our planet
__label__Evidence	100% agree, Comment section is for everyone to present their opinion at all times
__label__Position	The difficulty with moderation is that it is subjective - if done so via human moderation if there is no existing framework to follow particular viewpoints or comments may not be seen to be worthy of removing though for others this may not be the case. If moderating is done so by filtering words or with no human intervention, over-moderation is a risk. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2056305119832588

__label__Evidence	if there are 3 minor offenses there is no need to overly punish someone.
__label__Position	We should not allow newspaper websites to be moderated as this will lead to censorship and bias. It is possible that the moderators will let their own believes and preferences influence the decisions that they make and that could mean that people are unfairly censored. Look at this study from Germany, for example: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	factory farming should be banned as the animals in these farms are held in bad conditions.
__label__Evidence	Europe was composed of 13 countries in 1870 and 23 in 1914. Maybe it's time to change borders without bloodshed.
__label__Evidence	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Evidence	olympic games gives the world a chance to see the talent of many athletes from around the world
__label__Evidence	A different perspective
__label__Evidence	school uniforms should still be used because they can increase student focus
__label__Evidence	The dividing of refugees is a long-discussed plan. But in the end, no involved group agreed with these plans. Some countries do not like these people at all.
__label__Evidence	no it wont
__label__Evidence	we are getting to the point where even children cannot go to school and be 100% safe - this has to be stopped.
__label__Position	The active reporting of hate speech and the website being accountable for curating said reports
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking will violate human rights to freedom of speech and cause people to feel opressed, as that would mean that they can not voice out their opinions.
__label__Evidence	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Evidence	some animals would be extinct if it weren't for zoos
__label__Evidence	a multi-party system will lack real leadership and will mean that policies often end up being diluted or not passed at all as a majority can not be reached.
__label__Evidence	zero tolerance policies lead to better outcomes in schools
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Position	In a lot of developing countries, dairy is a primary source of protein specially for kids. So no, this seems extreme.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Evidence	Another con is this one
__label__Evidence	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Evidence	prostitution is a crime against women and by legalizing it you are only reaffirming that women are just objects to be used by men.
__label__Evidence	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Evidence	the military should be wholly the domain of governments, because they provide for national defense. a private military company is 100-percent for profit, making them less favorable to true national defense.
__label__Evidence	Just because something exists it doesn't mean it should be used in a way that it is abused.
__label__Evidence	Agree, the biggest contributors of CO2 emissions (USA and China) should do the most effort to reverse this
__label__Evidence	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Evidence	telemarketing is an invasion of privacy, especially when they call at late hours, during meals and/or repetitively even after asking for the call to stop.
__label__Evidence	the three-strikes law shouldn't be abolished because by having the law it keeps repeat offenders in prisons and gets them off of the streets.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Evidence	i agree that we should ban telemarketing as it is a nuisance and is often unable to be differentiated from scammers
__label__Evidence	we should ban private military companies because they may not have the same ideas as our country does
__label__Evidence	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Evidence	mandatory retirement allows for youger generations to enter the workplace
__label__Evidence	It is not worth the risk of cosmetic surgery just for people to look better.
__label__Evidence	some people choose not to vote for ethical reasons.
__label__Evidence	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Evidence	we should not ban factory farming because it helps to keep up with demand for food.
__label__Position	publisheres need to employ the services of fact checking before information goes online. this will discourage those who know they are lying from putting up false views. it has become simple to verfiy information online and this should be done for onlline comments too. https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/take-action/engage?gclid=Cj0KCQjw48OaBhDWARIsAMd966Ayc9p2D7Wmx7rju0OpfXpfBTAvnesQI0PzhoqZlJRK--8r2H-fZAQaAsIoEALw_wcB

__label__Evidence	three-strikes laws are a major reason for overcrowding in our prison system.
__label__Evidence	Executive Compensation should be limited when there are losses in the company
__label__Evidence	over sensitive people will be offended if we don't.
__label__Position	No, people have the right to express what they thing. But rather than removing access to comments, hate speech should be automatically flagged by the newspaper's website.
__label__Evidence	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Position	To achieve diversity in tackling environmental issues we need to be ready to accept that a fair environmental policy would CANNOT MEAN treating anyone in the same way. Many people struggle with the concept and difference between equity and equality. As well put in this post: "Equality provides the same resources to all and pays little attention to the fairness of desired outcomes; while the practice of equity requires more foresight, and intentional allocation of resources tailored to individual needs to reach desired outcomes". https://www.trinet.com/insights/the-difference-between-equity-and-equality-and-why-both-matter
__label__Evidence	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Evidence	those in the low classes of the united states can not afford more taxes which would be the result of a austerity regime.
__label__Evidence	I believe having the ability to read through the comments of other is very important when making decisions. The fact that monitoring is weak across most platforms is the biggest issue.
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading uses computers to analyze vast amounts of data to provide the best decisions in a way that humans are not capable of.
__label__Position	I also would like to add that, as mentioned here, if there is no agreement in how to flag comments with hate speech, probably deleting the comment section would be better than leaving it. As can be shown on this article from The Guardian people in general associate the comment section as toxic https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation
__label__Evidence	There is laws against discrimination and so should be upheld
__label__Evidence	I disagree, as newspaper websites should be held accountable (in some form) for the public engagement of their content. This should be done to mitigate the risks of cyberbullying https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/cyberbullying
__label__Evidence	whale populations are depleted and need protecting
__label__Evidence	if journalism is good, then it will not need a subsidy. if it is bad, then we should not be throwing money at it when there are greater needs in society such as education, health care and housing.
__label__Evidence	i think these ideas would be the way forward and i agree
__label__Evidence	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?

__label__Evidence	whaling is an important part of some cultures and provides jobs. you can't take that away from people that rely on it just because you don't like it.
__label__Evidence	the old saying "an eye for an eye" exists for a reason. if a person commits a horrible act, than swift punishment is not only a good thing but deserved.
__label__Evidence	the compensation to executives is a subject that only competer the companies and not the government. in the market of free competition that we have, it should be like this
__label__Evidence	The emphasis on negative stereotypes towards migrants comes mostly from people who don't know Africans or other migrants or refugees.
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't abolish the three-strikes law because it does give criminals a fair warning which is two chances of bad behavior and then if you do it again, you're no longer in society. violent crime is reduced
__label__Evidence	if someone invents something they should be able to profit from it
__label__Evidence	Human cloning is a bad science. this science will endanger the world since the cloned humans will have no parents, no rights and will behave in free-will.
__label__Evidence	gender-neutral language is political correctness taken to an absurd degree - there is no need to reinvent words and language for the sake of gender equality in an increasingly open society.
__label__Position	I do think that comments sections online can be a bit of a breeding ground for hate speech and racist, sexist and xenophobic comments. If one person comments something that falls into one of these categories, and encourages others. I think this is wider problem for society though, and living in a country that has freedom of speech I don't think we should censor what people think or what to say. I think more needs to be done to educate, rather than ban. Its a very tough question of how as a society we tackle this. I don't think the governments actions (such as brexit) have helped matters as there seems to be more of divide now than before.
__label__Evidence	According to the reports, illegal crossing of the borders has actually decreased from the year 2014 to 2015 which renders no use in building the wall.
__label__Evidence	If you want migrants, invite them into your home.
__label__Evidence	capital punishment is cruel and unusual
__label__Evidence	we should not legalize sex selection because when we do, we are messing with god's will.
__label__Evidence	But a negative comment is not bad especially if what was done deserves to reprimanded.
__label__Evidence	school uniforms do not allow children to emphasize their differences, denying individuality.
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Evidence	pride parades should be permitted because all people should be allowed to celebrate what they believe in.
__label__Evidence	"The issue of consistency is a HUGE one. As a sector, we do our best but the Public Sector should focus on things such as the skill gap for instance" (Chris Jofeh, Consultant to Arup and Chair of the independent Decarbonisation of Homes in Wales Advisory Group)

__label__Evidence	people choose to go to college. those that do should pay the bills for that schooling. we should not be taxed to give money to those that choose to borrow it.
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Evidence	During the covid pandemic time, social media helped people in maintaining their social life.Social media made it possible to stay connected with friends and loved ones all the time.

__label__Evidence	child actors are an important part of the acting industry and should continue to be allowed with restrictions to ensure the child's well being.
__label__Evidence	There is a shortage of skilled workers in many countries. When college education is free, this problem will be solved.
__label__Evidence	I think this intrudes on free speech and is a danger to moderating certain things the newspaper might not want to be affiliated with.
__label__Evidence	plastic surgery is a life altering decision and should not be taken lightly so much so that if you are a minor you should not be allowed to get it
__label__Evidence	Even though the new programming languages are replacing the old ones, the basic concepts are the same for almost all the programming languages. So, the one who has a degree in coding will have an advantage over the student from a non-IT background.
__label__Evidence	childrens' bodies are constantly changing throughout childhood so that, cosmetic surgery may be used to alter an disliked part of the body when it may change anyway, resulting in unnecessary surgery

__label__Evidence	without any sense or order or control, criminals would run rife.
__label__Position	We should have psychological counseling in educational institutions
__label__Evidence	AI unfortunately does inherit the biases of it's creators and is by no means a perfect solution.
__label__Evidence	Ukraine is infamous for its black market for weapons. Helping Ukraine by dumping weapons into such a country is folly.
__label__Evidence	even minors have the right to bodily autonomy and should be allowed to decide for themselves whether to have cosmetic surgery.
__label__Evidence	private military companies are dangerous. they are nothing more than mercenaries following the whims of their boss.
__label__Evidence	Additionally when fear is reinforced by facts like increased violence in every country with a high number of immigrants, and rapes of women it is not a problem of 'perception' but a simple reality.
__label__Position	By having rules or standards everyone needs to adhere to
__label__Evidence	capital punishment provides a firm sense of closure for victim's families and the lack thereof may harm them.

__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Position	I think that generally speaking, climate change can be corrected for the future. But we need big corporations to be on board, and the federal government to start mandating it.
__label__Evidence	I agree. It's also a good way to give a second chance to a person in order for them to change their behavior. And maybe help them understand that they are writing hateful thing, and educating them in a sense.
__label__Evidence	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Evidence	without intellection property rights there is no incentive to research and develop new products
__label__Evidence	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Evidence	child actors do not get a proper education and as such, the use of child actors should be banned
__label__Position	With so many people hiding behind their virtual persona to post hate speech, it makes it hard for the organisations that run comments sections. As the article linked to below shows, such people become ever more inventive in circumventing the algorithms so organisations will have to keep up. https://www.fastcompany.com/90539275/facebooks-ai-for-detecting-hate-speech-is-facing-its-biggest-challenge-yet
__label__Evidence	we should abolish the olympic games because they have not done what they were meant to do which is create peace. they have created more problems especially to those hosting them and are just beyond their time.
__label__Position	We should introduce a European citizenship
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Evidence	High voter turnout is usually desirable, but it's a symptom, not the root cause. Forcing people to go to the polls doesn't mean they will make more informed choices. Besides, voter turnout is a good metric that tells us where the potential problems of voter disenfranchisement are which is the first step to addressing them.
__label__Evidence	three-strikes laws makes criminals less likely to reoffend.
__label__Evidence	safe spaces only shield people from the realities of the world and thus leave them unprepared.
__label__Evidence	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs

__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.

__label__Evidence	legalizing organ trade would being about more healthy organs and tissue for transplanting then currently is available.
__label__Position	I don’t usually write something but I like reading comments. So I don’t want them to be taken away. There should be a combination of factors: moderators and a possibility for the users to vote a comment (like and dislike). Abusive comments should also be reported by the users, making the moderators job easier.
__label__Evidence	safe spaces are often used to stifle free expression of opinions
__label__Evidence	Safe spaces foster echo chambers of one-sided conversations, thus increasing a group's own intolerance and biases.
__label__Evidence	If we need other peoples opinions before we can form our own then we are literally just looking for confirmation bias of what we already believe
__label__Evidence	Now, we have so many online course platforms through which we can learn almost any skill from experts. We can also get certificates if we pass the tests. So, as Tim Cook said a 4-year degree seems old and traditional.

__label__Evidence	the right to keep and bear arms should be abolished because countries with strict gun control are far safer because they have far fewer incidents of violent gun crime
__label__Position	We should ban factory farming
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Position	While I understand people's points on censorship and freedom of speech, I do wonder to what extent do we allow "freedom of speech." Is someone else's freedom to feel safe, secure, etc. not worth as much as someone's freedom of speech? These are the types of arguments that hate speech brings up, and I would encourage you all to reflect on that as well.
__label__Evidence	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Evidence	scientific studies have shown that cannabis is safe as a recreational drug
__label__Evidence	In the EU labor market we will need more workers from outside Europe to continue the level of economic activities we are planning.

__label__Evidence	I agree completely. People need to be educated
__label__Position	comment sections are necessary so we can see different opinions on one topic
__label__Evidence	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Position	The reader comments space should not be eliminated as it prevents the concept of freedom of speech, however there should be a regulations or filters to remove such comments that may be harmful to other or include hate speech.

__label__Evidence	mental health is important, now a days more than ever before with how society is. safe places are important to have available for a healthy mental status.

__label__Evidence	I agree muting certain offensive words can have an impact on how much hate speech gets through on the website
__label__Evidence	missionary work is an affront to people's right to choose their own religion, by tying aid to a particular religion it's no different than imperialism
__label__Evidence	we should no adopt a multi-party system because nothing would ever get done with varying points of view.
__label__Position	Freedom of speech is important but it should not infringe on other people's rights. Hate speech does infringe on other people's rights but this should not affect people who also use the website to comment.
__label__Evidence	providing help in paying student loans will lift a financial burden off of students and allow them to become more indepedent.
__label__Evidence	they are at the top and should be able to make as much as possible.
__label__Evidence	This is more than just censoring
__label__Position	I think it should have rules when commenting in a online newspaper and also should have option to report comments that doesn't follow the rules
__label__Evidence	An EU army independent from NATO and its US commanders is critical to strategic autonomy and avoiding being dragged into destructive US wars in the Middle East like in the past.
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Evidence	school uniforms stifle the ability of kids to be creative in how they dress and express themselves.
__label__Evidence	I agree
__label__Position	Given that hate speech is an illegal and destructive thing (https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=Detection%20of%20anti-social%20behaviour%20in%20online%20communication%20in%20Arabic) and given that moderation is often opaque and unaccountable (https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=The%20New%20Governors:%20The%20People,%20Rules%20and%20Processes%20Governing%20Online%20Speech) I think I'd go back to my original comment and highlight a system focused on transparency, perhaps similar to reddit and/or wikipedia where almost all social interactions are documented and available under a persons username reference, thus allowing for easy accountability either for other readers to review, moderators to ban (or restrict) and police and other legal systems to use as evidence if and when needed.
__label__Evidence	there are much more important things to spend money on than autonomous cars - for example the threats posed by climate change and the pollution of our oceans.
__label__Evidence	The law! People break the law through hate speech, so the law needs to be the judge.
__label__Evidence	No, the direct election of a single leader by the people gives too much power to this person. And anyhow: nobody can know another person well enough. Look at the USA: the candidates for president are not real people but are constructed by PR agencies.
__label__Position	I don't believe that we can reverse the climate change that we have already done at this point, because we're too far gone. That said, I think that we do have the ability to at least slow it down or change the current course as to not do any more damage.
__label__Position	This is an interesting article on the outcomes of several news agencies that disabled the comments section. Some of the writers of articles were getting subjected to abusive messages. This would be another argument for verified profiles only allowed to access the websites with their real names and details.
__label__Position	monitoring each and every users s comments and warn the users that posts hate speech, and if they continue to posts comments of hate speech after several warnings then take down their accounts or ban them from the website.
__label__Evidence	I work on a programme in Ireland to help migrants, refugees and asylum seekers get employment and integrate. The qualifications, skills, experience and resilience they bring is amazing and so valuable to employers and the country. There is far too much focus on negative aspects of migration, much of it based on incorrect stereotypes. Migration brings lots of positives to countries but we need to be open to them.
__label__Evidence	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Evidence	The European Union is not a country and we must respect other countries' electoral choices.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them.

__label__Evidence	we should not ban private military companies as the national military is not able to perform smaller operations and should not be taken away from their national duties and responsibilities.
__label__Evidence	It is a good idea that France should coordinate its positions on the UN Security Council with the EU or leave its seat to the EU entirely. This way foreign policy decision-making within the EU can be made more straightforward.

__label__Evidence	executive compensation should be limited to make companies more profitable.
__label__Evidence	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	I think you could ban some words or have someone checking the comments and deleting the ones that are unappropiate, but limiting the whole comment section would be a mistake

__label__Evidence	This is a good way to monitor comments
__label__Evidence	You have to constantly ban people when they create new accounts

__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Evidence	I agree
__label__Evidence	It is a nice explanation
__label__Evidence	targeted killing is inhumane and should be banned.
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Evidence	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Evidence	whaling is damaging to whale populations as well as other species of fish.
__label__Position	by letting users know that hate speech can not be tolerated and then putting measures that can limit use of hate speech (warnings, report buttons, blocking, locking of accounts and also sensitizing users of consequences of using hate speech on comments space.
__label__Position	This is not a black or white topic. The question is how exactly we define hate speech. Criticism in itself is not hate speech, but it is easy to take things to extremes, especially when someone expresses their opinion anonymously. Education about the reasons is important to better understand our own feelings and behaviour. Educate people do not restrict them!
__label__Evidence	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Evidence	Yes, the most easy way to make sure that people don't spread hate speech any further would be to educate people on the steps that should be done before posting any of your opinions. https://www.thecommentingclub.co.uk/sharing-your-opinion/

__label__Evidence	we should ban private military companies as they are difficult to legislate and it is difficult to monitor the operations and ensure they are legal and ethical.
__label__Evidence	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Evidence	a two-party system has served us well for years; why change what has worked?
__label__Evidence	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed

__label__Evidence	We should legalize the organ trade so that operations are performed safely by licensed physicians in hospitals.

__label__Evidence	people deserve to have there inventions protected
__label__Position	I think removing the comment space will be of a disadvantage in terms of getting the engagement that the newspaper needs. Criticism doesn't always mean hate, however, filtering and censoring words will be the best option.
__label__Position	creating standards in which comments are allowed that allow for different opinions to be expressed but for that to be done respectfully. A personalised system that would remove hate comments that should be set using a certain standard to measure what qualifies as hate speech.
__label__Evidence	We should arrange our cities, our economy, and politics so that it is easy for people to behave ecologically responsibly. It requires a lot of work now, but it is work that we have to do if we want to transition to something more sustainable.
__label__Evidence	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Evidence	Unlike prison sentences, the death penalty is irreversible and irreparable
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?

__label__Evidence	relying on computers to do all this trading for us could lead to technical issues, hacking, or other problems that could lead to a total market crash.
__label__Evidence	That is true. Every country should take adequate measures in preserving nature and environment.
__label__Evidence	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Evidence	economic sanctions allow countries to try to curb bad behavior short of war.
__label__Evidence	compulsory voting would ensure that everyone becomes engaged in the political process and it would be the true voice of the people rather than the voice of the minority who vote.
__label__Evidence	in democracy, everybody has the option to choose what they want and how they want and canceling pride parades will be wrong and opposite of democracy.
__label__Position	Moderating comments is a far better method than eliminating comments entirely. I feel a method for reporting comments, though not perfect, is better, and then reported comments can be examined and removed if necessary.
__label__Evidence	I find it distressing and unreasonable to force an individual to leave behind their hard-earned pension pot. There should be a mechanism that stops this practice. Just as I can move myself, my family, furniture, car, and bank accounts freely within the EU, I should have the same right to move and merge my pensions into a single unit.

__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Evidence	TARGETED KILLING MAKES THE WORLD A SAFER PLACE REMOVING THOSE PEOPLE WHO AIM TO HARM OTHERS
__label__Position	I think removing space for comments is not the solution because how else will people discuss the matter at hand or share their opinion. I think hate speech should be set to be hidden from being viewed instread.
__label__Evidence	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information.

__label__Evidence	we should abolish the right to keep and bear arms because too many guns get into the hands of kids
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.

__label__Evidence	we live in a free society where people should be allowed to practise whatever religion they choose.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Evidence	Will allow anyone to have a comment where necessary
__label__Evidence	Instead of trying to stop immigration, we need to create a good integration plan and at the same time improve living conditions in the 2nd and 3rd world countries. This includes fighting for climate justice and decreasing unequal wealth distribution between countries.

__label__Evidence	We need a real and effective European democracy, therefore, a European Federation.
__label__Evidence	Raising prices in the energy sector cannot be the solution in the fight against climate change. The European Commission allows international firms to increase their prices, and as a result, household costs are rising at an incredible rate. The EU should definitely revoke these decisions, and instead of placing the burden on its own citizens, it should instead support them to lead a more sustainable way of life. The green transition should not be a heavy burden borne on the average citizen’s shoulders
__label__Evidence	three-strikes laws often lead to harsh punishments that do not fit their crimes
__label__Position	it is true that is we censor too heavily hate speech that those responsible for initiating these movements will be held less accountable to their words and actions and would be more difficult to identify them and prevent future potentially worse incidents

__label__Evidence	There already are websites for this and they're often echo chambers that create extremists that eventually shoot up malls.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Evidence	we should adopt libertarianism as it would be a system that might individuals have a fair chance in life other than just two major political parties.
__label__Position	most people seem to be of the opinion that cutting comments altogether is not constructive. A good point was made by an individual that viewing opinions from people you like only doesn't help you to grow (echo chamber).
__label__Evidence	sex selection should be allowed so that families can have children of the gender they desire without overpopulating in an attempt to gain the desires sex. selection would reduce births of an unwanted sex.

__label__Evidence	school uniform helps all children attend on a level playing field, free from worry about trying to keep up with expensive fashion trends.
__label__Position	I dont think we can eliminate hate speech from newspaper headlines. ONe idea could be do censor certain words, however, I think it is more important to educate people on their stance so they do no worry / are not concerned by others hateful words
__label__Position	Presentation: Have one or multiple members share their screen and give a short presentation, then open up to discussion. Share a challenge: Each person has a chance to share a challenge that they want feedback on and then gets time for other participants to give them feedback.
__label__Evidence	we should adopt atheism, there is not one piece of evidence for religion being fact, yet science is proven. religion is a manipulative tactic based on lies.
__label__Evidence	India is a big consumer market for many foreign companies. So, India and other developing countries are realizing the economic value of the data and the importance of data localization.

__label__Evidence	the olympic games create a tourism boom for the host city which injects a lot of cash which can be used to better locals so it shouldn't be abolished.
__label__Position	Social media is making us less social
__label__Evidence	I agree with this, or some coding introduced in the background somehow to not even allow bad comments/words to be posted at all.
__label__Evidence	Perhaps if there was some form of verification to reduce the hate speeches rather than eliminate free speech completely
__label__Evidence	(sorry I mean one in ten)
__label__Evidence	not focusing on the interconnection between free speech and hate crime
__label__Evidence	private military companies only purpose is to make money and as a result they don't focus on protection as much as they should be.
__label__Evidence	giving those you always provide hate speech anonymously gives them the upper hand with gettong away with it. It makes it easier for them to do it over and over again
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Evidence	safe spaces must be abolished because they contribute to the insecurity of minorities. they do not attack the problem of violence and discrimination
__label__Position	some words should be muted or not allowed to be used in newspapers, because they are offensive or they contribute to hate speech
__label__Evidence	Disagree because the rate at which suicides are happening due to

__label__Evidence	judicial activism can skew the law and make it unfair so we should limit judicial activism.
__label__Evidence	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion

__label__Evidence	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?

__label__Evidence	executives provide profits to shareholders and should be compensated accordingly

__label__Evidence	intellectual property rights mean that the people who come up with ideas or products get the financial gains from said product and so makes people more likely to innovate
__label__Position	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on an absolute majority, not unanimity.
__label__Evidence	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Evidence	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Evidence	people are allowed to believe and practice what they want, we can't pick and choose, so no, we can't ban it.
__label__Evidence	we should not legalize cannabis then more children will get a hold of it
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	Disabling comments reduces free speech and makes everything monitored and authorised - then you have to question who is controlling what we see?
__label__Evidence	Private military companies provide weapons and other items needed by the military, without them, they would be ill equipped.
__label__Evidence	Despite the propaganda, marijuana is actually more addictive than alcohol, the latter of which can be occasionally.
__label__Evidence	journalism has been an important profession.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading enables a more level playing field in the trading of shares.
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Position	Ideally comment section should not be available on newspaper to reduce hate speech

__label__Evidence	guns are already ubiquitous and outlawing them will only keep them out of the hands of lawful owners.
__label__Evidence	The death penalty is an old-fashioned, outdated, inhumane practice and must be abolished
__label__Evidence	intellectual property rights protects the ideas that will lead to a solid invention/investment and therefore need to be protected, not abolished.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Evidence	executives who run huge profitable companies that employ many people should be highly compensated for doing so
__label__Evidence	Honest
__label__Evidence	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Position	checking the comments before allow the user to post it
__label__Position	There is no one size fits all solution. With some newspapers taking an extreme viewpoint on subjects and individuals, these media outlets are actively encouraging hate speech. No comments should be censored but individuals that type hate speech should be held to account and either prosecuted or are required to attend an educational session - think Speed Awareness courses for low level speeding offences. And website that allows public facing comments should also have strict verification on accounts so people cannot hide behind fake or anonymous accounts.
__label__Evidence	there is no need to subsidize a site that isn't necessary
__label__Evidence	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Evidence	wearing uniforms decreases discrimination against children who do not have enough money to buy a lot of clothing
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Evidence	I agree that removing the comments section is not a solution to stopping hate speech as this just encourages users to go to different platforms, users need to be able to post their opinions but newspapers should have a responsibility to monitor what is being posted as well as a responsibility on the tone of articles they post online as this can have an effect on the type of comments that users leave as some users will see an article and the tone of the article will make them respond in a controversial way which encourages hate speech.
__label__Evidence	Our Europe continent is in debt and doesn't have the resources to care for people who have never paid taxes and continue to disregard our laws! We have enough poor people in Europe already and we need to take care of them!
__label__Evidence	we should not end the use of economic sanctions because they help the nations with exports and imports of goods

__label__Evidence	safe spaces restrict freedom of expression and should be prohibited
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Evidence	We should not adopt an austerity regime because the global economy is now rapidly growing, and the recession is years behind us.
__label__Evidence	we should legalize prostitution so that women as a whole are taught that their place in society is simply as a commodity to be used by someone with more money
__label__Evidence	capital punishment remains a good deterrent for serious crime
__label__Evidence	If you want something like 'increasing the percentage of women in all sectors', you need to create more women or reduce the number of men. I will better not ask questions in this direction.
__label__Evidence	there are still people that live off of whaling and banning it would take away their food and income.
__label__Evidence	Exactly the newspapers must be the place to comment because they give us the article but this article is written by a journalist. Therefore, the article represent the ideas of the journalist. Not all the time they are neutral. Sometimes they are even politically influenced. This often provokes discussions and where else can people say their opinion if there is no comment section?
__label__Position	Blocking words does not stop hate, what we need to do is have a filter that alerts a human so that a post. Posts/users should be identifiable to the platform they post on (not identifiable to the post but to the platform should any hate crime be identified)
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Position	Free speech is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it is necessary for an effective democratic society and on the other hand, people tend to abuse the right. Newspapers and publishing companies are major symbols of free speech, however, and there will always be disadvantages to be endured, hate speech inclusive. The solution is not to disable comment spaces but to continually implore and push for cooperation amongst readers.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Evidence	Such algorithms can be completely customized. For example: any posts containing a list of any key words can be prevented from posting.
__label__Evidence	The moderation can be subject to the Moderator's own thoughts/opinions.
__label__Evidence	there is no rational purpose for arming the populace; it causes more problems than it solves.
__label__Evidence	whaling is part of the culture of various indigenous population and should be allowed for the purpose of maintaining this tradition and way of life and sustenance, among other uses of a whale.
__label__Evidence	School uniforms limit the ability for students to express themselves.
__label__Position	No, I believe it would mute/cancel the freedom-of-speech spirit that should be contained within journalism.
__label__Evidence	private military companies should be banned because it is immoral to make money off of war
__label__Position	We can eradicate the anonymity of commentators so that they can understand that they will be held accountable for their comments.
__label__Evidence	In a multi-party system, minority needs are better catered to.

__label__Position	Norway and Iceland should be invited to the European Conference
__label__Evidence	judges by definition are supposed to be impartial. having activist judges defeats the purpose
__label__Evidence	telemarketing is still a useful sales tactic
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Evidence	the current system is broken and doesn't work. neither side can work together so having more options would force politicians to come together and do what's best for the people because no side would be majority
__label__Evidence	Absolutely, vague definitions are the downfall of effective communication. A lot like "Karen" replacing the actual words for situations like racist, entitled, rude, emotionally volatile, unreasonable etc. When we all hold a different definition for a word because it's been used too broadly it becomes harder to communicate. Clearly defining what hate speech is with links to the definitions in every format is what could help. People consume information more effectively in different modes like audio, visual, written etc.
__label__Position	Considering the arguments and evidence provided by everyone in this discussion, I believe we should somehow find a way to allow people to discuss their opinions (and avoid restricting free speech for the most part), while also protecting people from the potential harms to themselves directly and to and by society by supervising and moderating discussions.
__label__Evidence	I suppose the problem here is what a person says is their version of "free speech" could easily be seen in a different context by a reader. It's a very difficult issue to get right.
__label__Evidence	While I agree that it is getting harder every year, we need to do something about it now. It's never going to be an easy process, but the sooner we start, the better. We need to make drastic changes now so that policy and consumer interaction can be at the level necessary to move things in the correct direction.
__label__Position	i think that in order to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites only people who have purchased a supscription should be allowed to comment that way if they make hateful comments they can be tracked back to the individual

__label__Position	We should stop mass migration.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed

A link is given below, because there has been instances that hate speech not only started now but has been with us from eons, but people have found ways to deal with it. Here’s how you can help combat hate speech online and stop the spread of violent actions: Hold platforms accountable for hate speech. Report tweets, YouTube videos, Instagram posts, Facebook posts, and other speech that spreads hate to the platforms that are hosting it and demand action. If given the opportunity, be specific about what you find offensive and why. Raise awareness of the problem. Talk to your friends and family about why hate speech is not a problem just for the internet, but our societies and culture at large. https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=f872b161360cb19eJmltdHM9MTY2NjIyNDAwMCZpZ3VpZD0xNDgwZDNmYy03ZTI1LTYzYzMtMGZiZC1kZDNiN2ZkZDYyOTAmaW5zaWQ9NTQzNw&ptn=3&hsh=3&fclid=1480d3fc-7e25-63c3-0fbd-dd3b7fdd6290&psq=how+to+reduce+hate+speech+online&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9jaXZpbHJpZ2h0cy5vcmcvZWRmdW5kL3Jlc291cmNlL2NvbWJhdC1vbmxpbmUtaGF0ZS1zcGVlY2gvIzp-OnRleHQ9SGVyZSVFMiU4MCU5OXMlMjBob3clMjB5b3UlMjBjYW4lMjBoZWxwJTIwY29tYmF0JTIwaGF0ZSUyMHNwZWVjaCxoYXRlJTIwYWJvdXQlMjB0aGUlMjB3b3JzdCUyMGluc3RhbmNlcyUyMHlvdSUyMHNlZS4lMjA&ntb=1
__label__Position	It needs to be monitored, perhaps by an algorythm.
__label__Evidence	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?

__label__Evidence	a student does not have the resources to pay for the high cost of college
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	This would be a possibility, although even if people do not use their real names and details it is easy to track people online if they do not use a vpn (virtual private network) or tor (onion router). Connecting to a website reveals your ip address and a whole load of information which would be enough to track a person if a hate crime had been committed.
__label__Evidence	Many students do not believe in prayer and school prayer should be stopped because it does infringe on other students' rights not to pray.
__label__Evidence	The EU has no business 'promoting democracy' anywhere beyond its borders. Have we not seen sufficiently clearly in the past two decades where 'democracy export' leads?! Freedom bombs and human suffering everywhere. No, the EU must fully respect the sovereignty and national characters of all nations of this world. And that includes its own member states. The EU must immediately return to the letter of the EU treaties, and reaffirm in the strongest term the principles of conferral and subsidiarity.
__label__Evidence	collectivism brings people together
__label__Evidence	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Evidence	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Evidence	ending mandatory retirement would cause people to work longer to the detriment of younger job-seekers
__label__Evidence	adopting a zero tolerance rule in schools is good for safety.
__label__Evidence	Based on this article which i agree with, it is essential for humans to have the freedom to express their opinions. Free speech as given a voice to many groups of people to promote positive change.

__label__Evidence	The European Parliament in its current form is completely inadequate at representing the interests of all citizens, including the labor force. I cannot agree to give it more power until it is ensured that the MEPs are more responsive to their constituents. Electing them from individual election districts (not lists) and reducing their mandate to 2-3 years would be a good first step.
__label__Evidence	no belief or religion should be instituted in a blanket form. people are completely different with very different beliefs. no one way is good for everyone. there should be freedom to believe whatever one wants.
__label__Evidence	Human-based detection exists for certain content, but represents a really high cost for companies.
__label__Position	More Admin and block buttons
__label__Evidence	word filters can be circumvented, for example by replacing one or more letters with a number or asterisk. The filter would not remove the offensive word but it would still be clear to readers what word was being used.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Evidence	More illegal and legal migration will lead to more unemployment, lower wages, more insecurity, and less sustainable social systems.
__label__Evidence	To have any credibility when addressing foreign countries regarding issues of human rights violations, curbs on the freedom of speech and press, democracy, and more, the EU must ensure that its Member States meet minimum standards on these fronts too.

__label__Evidence	Some people moonlight to pursue their passion when the earnings from their passion cannot replace the salary from their main job. Several entrepreneurs take this route and leave their jobs once they earn enough from their new ventures.
__label__Evidence	Older people should be forced to retire at a certain age because the world is steadily changed and their knowledge becomes outdated
__label__Position	And also media contents should be cross checked and should publish truth only without hurting the parties involved personally.

__label__Position	Check this link: https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons that shows how widespread the problem of hate speech is, and how much hate speech online leads to violence in the real world. We ought to watch what we say on the internet because some people are gullible enough to put into action what people suggest should be done to mitigate certain subjective problems.
__label__Position	By having guidelines that must be adhered to with regard to the truth of stataements so that they are factual and not "alternative facts" and by banning anything that could be construed as hate speech,

__label__Evidence	then you are just living in an echo chamber with no opposing views
__label__Evidence	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Position	I don't think it's a good idea to eliminate the comment space from newspapers, thereby reducing readers' ability to weigh in on news items. I think newspapers should use software programs that can flag potentially hateful commentary and automatically remove it. As well, newspapers should have moderators who can check to make sure that any hate speech is caught and removed as soon as possible after it appears.
__label__Evidence	why should anyone be forced to vote?it is their right to vote or not to vote as they see fit.it is not a democratic system to force people to do this.

__label__Evidence	Since prison's radicalize more than they rehabilitate, three strikes laws end up creating more re-offenders by putting people away for longer in an environment that radicalizes them.
__label__Evidence	the likelihood of unintended deployment of nuclear weapons is high so they should be abolished.
__label__Position	More moderators would be the simplest strategy for reducing hate speech but there will still be a period of time where the hate speech is live on the website before being taken down. Using report buttons on newspaper websites can help the moderator identify the hate speech faster.
__label__Evidence	Safe spaces are overwhelmingly used as a political tool to silence conservative voices, and that political skew shows that they serve more to indoctrinate young people than to alleviate social trauma.
__label__Evidence	Adaptation and fighting climate change often go hand in hand
__label__Evidence	I overall agree. But, newspaper comment sections are very public and mainstream. Allowing hate speech on such places makes it seem less taboo, and more allowed. These aren't the kinds of ideas we want people to think are 'ok'.
__label__Evidence	it is so hard when talking about a group of people to choose whether to use he or she, him or her, or give up and say they and them. having a gender neutral language would end this problem.
__label__Evidence	we should not ban cosmetic surgery for minors because they should have the freedom to express their beauty even if that means correcting it with surgery. it can improve their self-worth and happiness.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Position	There should be ways to monitor the type of language used, perhaps through AI. It should be able to pick up key words related to hate speech.
__label__Evidence	we should not abandon the use of school uniform to make sure everyone is wearing the same thing to make people not stand out due to less money or resources
__label__Evidence	There need to be some rules for integration: Integration does not mean giving up European values and culture.
__label__Evidence	It can be useful for readers to see readers comments as they may present another interesting opinion or be informative in some way.
__label__Evidence	criminals should be given a chance to reform, even if they committed the same crime multiple times.
__label__Position	by tighter regulation of newspapers and make them responsible for their content, make them vet and verify all contributed content
__label__Evidence	I agree, what's the line between hate speech or just having a differing opinion
__label__Evidence	legalizing prostitution will increase the number of women who enter into this degrading profession.
__label__Evidence	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Position	We should stop Brussels from imposing ideologies, concrete policies to develop in exchange for financial aid, interference in agricultural production or legislating in judicial matters
__label__Evidence	sex selection could create places where boys outnumber girls by a lot since there are many places that value boys more than girls, and this could create problems as they get older
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Evidence	Without private military companies, the military would be ill equipped and not able to get the tools they need,
__label__Evidence	Storing data in India means higher operational costs for payment system operators. Because in other countries they have cheaper alternatives. And also for cross-border transactions, they have to store the data in two places, which increases costs. There is a probability that these extra costs may pass on to the consumers.

__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Position	The EU needs strong advertising and recruitment strategies for students and qualified employees
__label__Evidence	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Evidence	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Evidence	no, it would eliminate way to many jobs.
__label__Evidence	nuclear weapons help keep the peace in uncertain times
__label__Position	everyone should be entitled to comment and have opinions but the comment section should be checked and hate comments deleted and that user blocked on the website
__label__Evidence	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Evidence	telemarketing is an easy way for people to connect with consumers that are interested in their products.
__label__Evidence	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments

__label__Evidence	we should ban missionary work because people are getting killed going to bad places.
__label__Evidence	It should not be abolished, it is a tradition, it should be controlled but not removed
__label__Evidence	You are right -People have lost the ability to debate, and think that shouting the loudest wins the argument.
__label__Position	Hate speech online requires different strategies for different platforms. Facebook vs. newspapers. Youtube vs. LinkedIn. Twitter vs. a specialised forum etc. All have different userbases and customs/habits that those users are accustomed too. There's no 'one size fits all' fix. We have to think specifically about newspaper websites - who's using them, how are they accessing them, what sorts of comments are the ones cropping up the most.
__label__Position	It's quite easy to use freedom of speech as an excuse when people comment on certain topics, so there should be some kind of restrictions on how people get to express their opinions.
__label__Position	Everyone should have equal access to affordable and high-quality public services, including health
__label__Evidence	If a media regulate how people respond to their news, they can aid the fight against hate speech.
__label__Evidence	we should ban the church of scientology because they brainwash their members into giving them huge sums of money.
__label__Evidence	I believe we still can. We could live amore local life
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Evidence	The problem is hate speech really means political speech. It's a way of silencing dissent of political agendas that are transforming certain countries societies in a way people don't like.
__label__Evidence	the words "he" and "she" are a way of labeling human beings and not everyone feels like they fit into either of these categories. by doing away with gender specific words you will make everyone feel the same.
__label__Evidence	Prostitution promotes the repression of women by men. Legalizing prostitution condones such behavior.
__label__Position	I feel like there are certain topics for which disabling comments is the best option. For example extremely sensitive stories about severe crimes or ones that involve children.
__label__Position	Moderating comments could be a viable solution. The use of AI could make it easier given that there could be thousands and thousands of comments, too much for human moderator/s to keep track of.
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Evidence	people are entitled to believe in any god that they choose to believe in. as religion offers comfort, aatheism should not be adopted.
__label__Position	Advanced AI is the ultimate answer. It is the cheapest and most unbiased moderator option.
__label__Evidence	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Evidence	I think it could cause more harm than good as people would find another way to
__label__Position	the comment section should remain as it allows the readers to engage with the article. to reduce the risk of hate speech there should be restrictions and should be moderated to ensure the risk of hate speech is minimum
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading will destroy traditional trading occupations.
__label__Evidence	Could exclude nasty comments
__label__Evidence	cooperation among countries is essential nowadays. avoiding armed conflict when one country's terrorizing others by the use of economic sanctions is a great solution to return that country back more cooperation
__label__Position	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Position	We should limit the number of plastic types used for packaging
__label__Evidence	pride parades can cause increased tensions which requires more police protection. this can also cause fighting to break out.
__label__Evidence	I opt without a that the Balkan countries should be EU members, so their membership status helps them evolve. We have great examples in Romania and Bulgaria, and going back to the eighties, to Spain and Portugal. Those countries started to truly develop when they joined the EU. Besides, as you stated, the Balkan countries have made huge efforts in the last years to approach the EU.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Evidence	mandatory retirement makes sure that fresh ideas and fresh bodies keep flowing through business which is a good thing.
__label__Evidence	It will avoid people upsetting others.
__label__Evidence	legalizing the organ trade will help to save the lives of large numbers of people that current don't have access to organs they need to stay alive
__label__Evidence	human cloning is vital for medical science as it might be able to identify treatments and cures for diseases
__label__Evidence	people should be able to do what they want with their bodies.
__label__Position	I think that comments sections should remain on websites, but that they should be heavily regulated. Filter words could be used to discourage and identify hate speech, but in addition I think there should be someone who monitors comments for misinformation and who will respond with information and links in order to correct misinformed commenters. Comments are great to help encourage reflection and other viewpoints, but they can be very damaging.
__label__Position	The only way I can see this being done fairly is hiring a software development team/company to develop an algorithm or "Bot" that can be updated with keywords, phrases and common dog whistles used by racists, homophobes, misygonists etc. You would also need a dedicated moderation team that are able to catch anything that slips through the cracks and who are able to understand nuance that a bot could not
__label__Evidence	we should not legalize organ trade because some people would be getting bad organs
__label__Evidence	Because some peoples opinions can be hurtful to others
__label__Evidence	collectivism is pointless. it caters, not to the whole, but to the loudest in a group. that leaves so many out.
__label__Evidence	At present, the rich are getting richer and poor people are getting poorer. A free college education will reduce social inequality too because as everyone can study and learn the skills in college, everyone will have an equal opportunity to settle in the career of their choice.
__label__Evidence	there is no way to achieve this. there is no guarantee that whichever country really got rid of their nuclear weapons and didn't just hide them. it's unrealistic and impossible to achieve.
__label__Evidence	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Evidence	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	Having bots to look for hate speech
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars allow those with disabilities that hinder driving to be able to travel to appointments, shopping and social events, and not to live isolated from others.
__label__Evidence	I completely agree with this. There are multiple exposes and car engineering shows were independent organizations show not only that we can reduce carbon emissions, but that we can also run cars way more efficiently with our current fossil fuels. If people demand the same level of efficiency with future fossil fuel using vehicles we can begin to make real changes. This will in turn give us the time necessary to begin building the infrastructure necessary for those alternative fuel sources as we will need to build electric gas stations and charge stations around the country before demanding an increase in those alternative vehicles from organizations.
__label__Evidence	zero telerance policied do not address underlying causes for the behaviour that is causing the issue
__label__Position	Research shows that letting comments proliferate with little oversight is a “dangerous recipe,” Andincivility and negative comments can have a long-term impact. Certain commenting software use algorithms meant to flag problematic comments, but machines can only do so much. Should newspapers really be spending already depleted resources on monitoring comments?

__label__Evidence	we shouldn't abolish the three-strikes laws because everyone deserves a chance and it's a fair system
__label__Position	We should deprivatize the healthcare industry
__label__Position	Be more strict when allowing people to create profiles, that require identification before allowing anybody to comment. If they choose to be anonymous do not allow them to comment.
__label__Position	I incline to the opinion that it is almost impossible to elimate hate speech from such comment sections without elaborate checking systems and that these are not worth the trouble. There I think the best solution is to remove the comment sections altogether. What useful purpose do they actually serve? None I would suggest. I doubt if the newspaper editors or journalists pay much heed to the views expressed therein and I'm sure that politicians and powers that be don't.
__label__Evidence	readers should be able to have their say
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?

__label__Evidence	we should limit executive compensation because it only helps the rich
__label__Evidence	The comment section should be a safe where everyone is free to place their opinion and ask question without someone making them feel somehow about themselves.
__label__Evidence	compulsory voting would increase political activism
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	what is the point of comments if not all views are allowed to be expressed?
__label__Evidence	A multi-party system prevents the leadership of a single party from setting policy without challenge.
__label__Evidence	Report comment buttons would make that comment flagged up to moderators and therfore removed quickly
__label__Evidence	people with more money buying organs will make poor people get lesser treatment and have longer waits.
__label__Evidence	some people would still make hate comments, as they could give a false name to begin with.

__label__Evidence	Some parents put too much stress on children to study. They send their children to tuition after school or just make them sit to do homework forgetting the importance of free time to play. This movement has the potential to change their minds and as a result, they may encourage their children to go out and play.
__label__Evidence	Beauty pageant can increase the objectification of women.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	Comments should be monitored
__label__Evidence	Sexual violence violates human rights, irrespective of the relationship between the criminal and the victim. IPC 375, which criminalizes rape, discriminates against married women for using the section on their husbands. Though one can file a case under the domestic violence act for marital rape, not terming marital rape as a crime will deter the victims from filing cases. Every law on the planet is prone to be misused. That doesn’t mean that we should not have laws in order to avoid false cases.
__label__Evidence	missionaries are intrusive to other countries and very invasive to the culture.
__label__Evidence	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Evidence	we should abolish the right to keep and bear arms as this right has gotten out of hand with too many mass shootings.
__label__Position	Whatever the decision may be, the law and freedom of speech needs to be considered
__label__Evidence	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Evidence	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments

__label__Position	As social media have come to dominate socio-political landscapes in almost every corner of the world, new and old racist practices increasingly take place on these platforms. Racist speech thrives on social media, including through covert tactics such as the weaponization of memes (Lamerichs et al. 2018) and use of fake identities to incite racist hatred (Farkas et al. 2018).

__label__Evidence	I have advice on how you can defend against anything on the Internet. Turn it OFF. And one more piece of advice, try to study something about freedom and responsibility, they are not just mere words.

There are texts thousands of years old and also recent books ... you can start anywhere you wish ...

__label__Evidence	intellectual property rights are vital to protect innovation from those wishing to exploit it further along the developmental cycle, and equally vital to encourage entrepreneurs in the first place.
__label__Evidence	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Evidence	English is ideal as it is spoken internationally as the language of commerce, travel, and political exchange. Esperanto isn't.
__label__Position	I agree. It is always good to allow people to express their opinions however readers of the comment should also be allowed the freedom to respond by either agreeing, disagreeing or flagging it as inappropriate if the comment is offensive.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars are a thing of the future
__label__Evidence	Three strikes laws often punish those who have been pushed into crime by their socioeconomic background, which is unjust.
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Evidence	parents of minors should be the people making the determination as they know the needs of their own children over government enforcing bans that impede on such.

__label__Evidence	they are a deterrent for foreign forces not to attack smaller countries
__label__Evidence	it would be nice if the comment could be made visible after it has been removed. others can know what to avoid and if it is NOT actually hate speech the conversation could be continued don't you think?
__label__Evidence	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not be implemented, people must learn to take some criticism in a positive way, it can be helpful.
__label__Evidence	The subsidies were originally intended to ensure the security of supply for the European population. But when you export subsidized food, it's at the expense of European taxpayers. Export yes, but then no more subsidies for these products.
__label__Position	Homeopathy brings more harm than good
__label__Evidence	collectivism is a bad form of advancing a nation. some lazy person will profit of other hard work and contribute nothing themselves
__label__Evidence	school uniforms are an expense that many families can't afford. there are plenty of ways to get very cheap clothing, but discounted uniforms are more difficult to obtain.
__label__Position	I agree with Emily, that perhaps we could all benefit from stepping back a little from the virtual world. The internet does tend to create pockets of like-minded people to air their extreme views with anonymity and this can become dangerous, as we ahve seen with groups such an Incels.
__label__Evidence	school prayer cannot account for the array of beliefs or non-beliefs students may hold.
__label__Position	By taking out some sections that people find disinteresting and replace it with something interesting.
__label__Evidence	we would not be able to oversee their operations and prevent them from unethical activities.
__label__Evidence	Even though damage is done, there are ways to counter the damage through other actions. If enough of these are done, they can cumulatively overpower the irreversible actions and thus reduce climate change as a net overall.
__label__Evidence	by forcing someone to retire it then means that spot is open for a younger person to fill the role, someone who could really use the money
__label__Position	I believe it is fair for hate speech comments to be censored, because it could lead to violent public behavior. (read this: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech)
__label__Evidence	the use without measure of cannabis harms the mental health of the people therefore it is necessary that the intention to legalize cannabis be eliminated
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Evidence	intellectual property rights protect the small guy from being gobbled up by large companies who have more money to create a product.
__label__Evidence	we should change how people treat others rather than make safe spaces
__label__Position	make it so
__label__Evidence	This is frequently used in social media platforms now, but it can be quite time consuming. Also the tone of a statement can be misinterpreting in text format.
__label__Evidence	nuclear weapons are expensive to maintain
__label__Position	https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/what-is-online-hate-crime/ shows that the exposure to hate speech on one of the biggest websites (FB) was only 0.11%. Surely this shows that there shouldn't be an overall ban on comments sections? Monitoring must be working.
__label__Evidence	people should have the right to not vote.
__label__Position	block the person who always use hate speech
__label__Evidence	Some views use coded racist language. Eg gypsies are often described using disguised phrases
__label__Evidence	for the greater good of the whole community collectivism ensures everyone benefits, not just the few.
__label__Position	I don't think hate speech should be allowed because it can cause more hate if readers agree so i think the comments should be monitored.
__label__Evidence	not everyone can be reformed. some people are a danger to society, and two failed attempts at reform is far more than they deserve.
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Position	There should be moderators of the discussion, people who use hate speech should be informed of what is problematic about their comments, comments should be deleted or they might be hidden but you can open them and read the moderators comments. If educating is not helping after first attempt, person should be restrcited form further discussion.
__label__Evidence	Hunting people down for their opinions is too much like big brother/censorship!
__label__Evidence	judicial activism can be beneficial in some cases.
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Evidence	we want to have an inclusive society and try to make each and every individual feel comfortable

__label__Evidence	human cloning may solve all types of medical problems.
__label__Evidence	There need to be some rules for integration: Integration does not mean completely open borders.
__label__Evidence	Adolescents can be very self-conscious about their appearance. If a student thinks their uniform is unflattering, it may cause them discomfort and embarrassment.
__label__Evidence	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Position	In summary most of the points made regarding the elimination of hate speech were very insightful and some were really good ideas. The idea to have users flag bad comments and they be hidden and later checked by moderators was a great idea, another good idea was to help make people aware of the impact hate speech causes to some individuals.
__label__Evidence	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Position	Get a group to fairly decide on words that should be banned
__label__Evidence	there is no reason to have cosmetic surgery except for vainity and it carries risks so it should be banned
__label__Evidence	people should not have to endure higher taxes to pay for the government's inefficiency.
__label__Evidence	college is getting more and more expensive each year so students should be getting as much help as they need
__label__Evidence	I personaly like the General Policy Recommendation from the Council of Europe to this topic: https://www.coe.int/en/web/european-commission-against-racism-and-intolerance/recommendation-no.15
__label__Evidence	Some hate speech is clear, you can moderate the high level hate speech easily with key word bans, however some topics are more nuanced
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Evidence	we need to keep our country safe and protected
__label__Evidence	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Evidence	Breeding programs in zoos are saving many animals from extinction. Without these programs in zoos we would be losing losing many more species from the world.
__label__Position	Websites need to be held accounbtable for hate speech
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Evidence	legal marijuana could actually improve opportunities for the black market because cartels can easily undermine licensed sellers prices and the black market will thrive
__label__Evidence	collectivism goes directly against the rights of individuals. individual freedom is what this country was founded on. it is rights violative to put the majority above individuals.
__label__Evidence	We should not abolish safe spaces as people need somewhere to feel safe if they are persecuted.
__label__Evidence	there are many sectors need subsidizing more than journalism, journalists already make good money, more money to them will be a waste.
__label__Evidence	some states have already done it so we might as well.
__label__Position	I would almost agree that removing the comments would be beneficial. I've very rarely seen a comment on an article that actually contributed towards learning more about the content. It's typically just people yelling they don't agree without any true thought.
__label__Evidence	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Evidence	criminals should have a chance to go straight, even if they've committed the same crime multiple times.
__label__Evidence	By following friends on social media and not communicating with them privately, we can only know the things they post on their accounts. We may not know much about what is really happening in their lives. That means we will have no meaningful connections with friends. The convenience of contacting people online made us prefer it over meeting them outside.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Evidence	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Position	Placing blame and/or trying to figure out who's at fault is pointless. It doesn't matter if it's the corporations, individuals, or natural processes--the problem exists, whatever the cause. And it has to be addressed, even if it's expensive, even if it's monumental, even if it seems impossible to solve--because without working toward a solution, our planet and ourselves will cease to exist.
__label__Evidence	What works for Islington may not work across the country. Conservation policy work has always been constrained by lack of resources. It must be 30 years since we were trying to get govt to require Local Authorities to carry out Conservation Area Appraisals and keep them up to date. (John Preston)
__label__Position	We should invest in the development of high-speed railways
__label__Evidence	journalism is incredibly important when it comes to unbiased coverage of our government.
__label__Position	freedom of speech is important for people to express their view, but that does not allow hate
__label__Evidence	executive compensation provides motivation for executives to act in ways that are beneficial to the company and shareholders.
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Evidence	While this would eliminate all hate speech, newspapers would not implement it, as the interaction drives hits on their site, so the comments section is an essential part of spreading the news person to person
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Evidence	the right to keep and bear arms is antiquated as it was utilized to form militia's during times of conflict and war and is no longer necessary.
__label__Evidence	justice can not be subject to personal opinions
__label__Position	The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is often used as a reason not to have readers comments.
__label__Evidence	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	We should ban cryptocurrencies
__label__Evidence	Decision-making is today made unilaterally minding short-term economic interests and employers' demands. We need a social, progressive policy in the EU.
__label__Evidence	I disagree, the person commenting can do so in a manner that isn't hateful. Only people who choose hate as their platform in getting their opinion across will be blocked. Hopefully these people rethink their approach and try again in a different manner
__label__Evidence	Political parties declare certain promises in their manifestos. After getting elected, the citizens have a right to know why the promises made by the political parties were not fulfilled.
__label__Evidence	Agreed, BUT only on one condition: that every euro be spent under the joint control of local and European officers. There's so much corruption in Africa that otherwise of every 100 euros sent there, at least 80 would end up in the pockets of corrupt officers. And in that case, it's better to not send anything.
__label__Evidence	State subsidies for jouranalism aren't supported by a majority of the populace, making it undemocratic and not something the state should do.
__label__Evidence	Firearms are typically far more dangerous to the owner and his/her family than any intruder, due to misuse, murder, and suicide.
__label__Evidence	people should be free to worship who they want religion can instill good values and morals into people
__label__Evidence	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	Having comments be reviewed before they get posted would help - if the newspaper doesn't have enough resources to have someone manually review all comments, then some kind of automated solution filtering out certain keywords could be implemented.
__label__Position	I agree with Emily, that perhaps we could all benefit from stepping back a little from the virtual world. The internet does tend to create pockets of like-minded people to air their extreme views with anonymity and this can become dangerous, as we ahve seen with groups such an Incels.
__label__Position	It is important to understand what hate speech actually is. Attached is an example of what may be construed as hate speech, but it is only through a shared understanding of what hate speech is that it can start to be tackled. Effective moderation to agreed guidelines is the key.
__label__Evidence	with the wave of mass shootings that have occurred the world would be a much safer place without guns.
__label__Evidence	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Evidence	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Evidence	Lack of accuracy due to reliance on tech, opportunities to get past algorithm
__label__Evidence	to pick out one religion out of many to ban would be an infringement of the freedom to practice any religion of your choosing.
__label__Position	i totally agree
__label__Evidence	This makes a good point. I think people should have freedome of speech but I also do think websites need to monitor comments.
__label__Evidence	I strongly agree with your point due to people posting negative comments and can also lead to cyberbullying in a way. I feel like policies need to be in place to ensure that people who misuse the online newspaper website face certain consequences and the people who have access to the comment section also their accounts needs to be properly register for tracing.
__label__Evidence	you shouldn't have to share what you have with other places who do things that are against your country's beliefs.
__label__Evidence	child actors are important so programs can show people of ages and are reflective of society. child actors are an important part of the industry and are needed to reflect people accurately.
__label__Evidence	nuclear weapons are an exhorbitantly costly defence strategy that will never be used, just a deterrant at a huge price.
__label__Evidence	we should ban cosmetic surgery for minors because they don't have the mental capacity to make a life changing decision.
__label__Evidence	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Evidence	Will Russia also pay their share? Will Austria pay for starting WW1 or will it be Serbia? Will Poland and Hungary pay for occupation of parts of Czechoslovakia in 1938/1939? Will France pay for starting napoleonic wars? It is time to forget what happened almost 100 years ago and focus on the future and I say that as a Czech citizen whose country was occupied by Austria, Germany/Poland/Hungary and then by SSSR and all eastern satelite states.
__label__Evidence	nuclear weapons are effective in creating a stand-off between counties that have them. this can result in less people dying.
__label__Evidence	That is the problem not everyone thinks that they saying something hateful until someone mentions it.
__label__Evidence	each case has different circumstances and certain things need to be taken into consideration for each one. judicial activism allow the court to consider the circumstances of each crime.
__label__Position	Everybody should be allowed to have their own opinion but at the same time they need to be respectful of others and be aware that not everybody has the same views.
__label__Evidence	I agree, it may be a better idea to have neutral admin who can monitor comments, rather than the producer of the article or an algorithm.
__label__Evidence	Many child actors are put under a huge amount of pressure to perform well and can be denied most of their childhood by unscrupulous adults that only want to profit from their talents.
__label__Evidence	we should ban telemarketing since it is a nuisance to the people who they berate with phone calls. very few of the people called are interested. wasting peoples time needs to be stopped.
__label__Position	modrate what can be posted before it allowed to be published finally
__label__Evidence	Quotas are always disgusting examples of oppression and evil. I don't want anything of that, I want freedom and free choice.
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't ban the use of child actors because it is a way for children to find a career early in their life
__label__Evidence	in practicing libertarianism we would adopt philosophical and financial customs that would improve our quality of life
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Evidence	factory farming provides negative outcomes across several areas, the most important of which is personal livelihood, so it should be banned.
__label__Position	Serious crimes should lead to rapid expulsion from the EU
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Position	As the comments are read by human beings, their opinion and/or bias come into play when the comments are posted. This can therefore bring ambiguity to the comments posted depending upon who is reading/approving them.
__label__Evidence	I think by promoting the hate speech it very much takes away the meaning of the subject. You dont need to be hateful to agree/disagree with something. You can be constructive in your approach and this will have a greater impact on the issue and cause for a logical debate between people. So an element of policing is required
__label__Position	this is not possible, you either allow free speech or you don't
__label__Evidence	Yes, and it should be payed out to every citizen of the EU. Those people with a lower CO2 footprint - typically lower income family - would greatly benefit from it and be incentivized to invest in cleaner energy, heating etc.
__label__Evidence	if pride parades are canceled, then many lgbtq+ youth will have nowhere to safely celebrate who they are.
__label__Evidence	I agree that we have to try. There is no quitting.
__label__Evidence	People will tick that they agree, but write what they want anyway! And if they're anonymous there are no repercussions for them.
__label__Position	Freedom of speech doesn't equal to freedom of consequences. Hate speech entails inciting violence and hatred towards often already disenfranchised groups of people; it's not done in the spirit of good faith discourse. Hate speech doesn't need to be platformed. Either eliminate the comments section or moderate it heavily.
__label__Evidence	We already struggle to prosecute rapists what makes you think cyber bullying takes priority?
__label__Position	I think that growing more trees can reverse the adverse effects of manmade climate change. Trees release fresh oxygen. Protecting the environment is the key to reversing the harmful effects of climate change. It is most important to preserve the natural environment and plant more trees. Trees release oxygen which is very good for health.
__label__Evidence	a multi-party system leads to too much division and there may never be an overall consensus
__label__Evidence	I think it is part of the responsibility of having a website. If the newspaper is not listed as a +18 platform for using insults or hate speech, then young people would be affected.
__label__Evidence	we should not legalize prostitution because people should only be with one other person in a marriage relationship.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars have not been proven to be safe.
__label__Evidence	freedom of religion means children should be able to pray where they want to.
__label__Evidence	I do agree. I do believe there is some impact on climate due to man's activity but this has been studied over such a short term that I am skeptical of any hard and definite conclusion.
__label__Evidence	zero tolerance can punish children unreasonably due to the lack of flexibility where a child could for instance be suspended just for bringing a rubber band into school which could be classed as a weapon.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Evidence	If journalistss are allowd hteir view and opinion which in many instances can be objecive, public should defientley be allowed to shar theirs, since ournalists are there to promot information and possibly dialogue as well
__label__Evidence	I agree
__label__Evidence	our society needs to be able to label and identify a person as a male or female for many reasons such as taxes, employment, health care, etc, so we should not adopt a gender neutral language.
__label__Evidence	missionary work is a waste of time and should be completely banned.
__label__Position	The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is interesting tackled in this article: https://www.wired.co.uk/article/online-stubbornness
__label__Evidence	legalizing prostitution will allow it to be carried out in a safe environment
__label__Evidence	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Position	comment sections are necessary so we can see different opinions on one topic
__label__Position	People have different opinions on different news topics and may not see their hate comment to be something bad while others may. A comment section is made available for everyone to share their opinions. Although sometimes the hate comments are taken out of hand so aa AI moderator should be made available to filter out the hate comments that get out of hand.
__label__Evidence	agree, the news could start selling fake information if the comment section would be removed
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Evidence	pride parades promote improper lifestyles
__label__Evidence	Three strikes laws destroy families by taking away parents and children for the rest of their lives with no chance of parole.
__label__Evidence	the school uniform takes away bullying for those who cannot afford what is "in"
__label__Evidence	It matters not how unlikely the event of nuclear conflict is, because the danger it presents is grave. In order to survive as a society, we must get rid of nuclear weapons.
__label__Evidence	This would work well with non-bias moderators
__label__Evidence	it costs too much money to explor space, it could be used elsewhere to benefit humans
__label__Evidence	I think that removing peoples ability to comment would be more harm than good because they will just do it elsewhere like social media platforms.
__label__Evidence	private military companies are largely unregulated, and providing muscle for financial gain fosters corruption and undemocratic process - it is the survival of the powerful over the poor, oppressed.
__label__Position	Reducing the space reduces the opportunity for free speech and therefore the debate needs to be around whether or not free speech is allowed? Personally, I feel that the newspapers need to carefully regulate what is being published and this includes the comments section.
__label__Evidence	private companies have less strict guidelines and less oversight which makes them careless
__label__Evidence	the do not abide by the same rules and regulations of a government run military and need to be banned.
__label__Evidence	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Evidence	https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/8/15/20806384/social-media-hate-speech-bias-black-african-american-facebook-twitter

__label__Evidence	we shouldn't end mandatory retirement it helps the younger generations more likely to find jobs
__label__Evidence	evidence shows the Church of Scientology is a money laundering, corrupt organisation that hides behind its religious status whilst abusing its members.
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Position	"Solutions for retrofitting" (Crispin Edwards)
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Evidence	the rights holder would make less money could their creation would be diluted by copycats
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	whaling is an important part of several cultures. it is wrong to impose our rulings on their ancient beliefs
__label__Evidence	who knows what the future holds in possible medical breakthroughs based on stem cell research. we need to keep funding this important research to see what discoveries can be made.

__label__Evidence	sex selection is a slippery slope that may lead to parents picking other traits to screen for, from innocent ones like hair color, to larger ones like iq.
__label__Position	There should be some level of censoring applied
__label__Evidence	executive compensation should be limited because i don't think the executives should get a bunch extra just because of that position.
__label__Evidence	the right to keep and bear arms is the bedrock constitutional right of every person both to protect themselves and their families, and banning this would infringe on civil liberties.
__label__Evidence	there is no need to adopt gender-neutral language because people should be addressed with appropriate genders.
__label__Position	Hate speech in a form of criticizing the newspaper website can be a good thing for the website to improve here and there. Not all hate speech is bad
__label__Evidence	telemarketing can cause distress for people who do not know how to get rid of the callers.
__label__Evidence	AI algorithms are frequently biased. There's still a long way to go before reliable AI algorithms are developed. Until then, using AI algorithms alone to moderate the comment sections of newspapers will likely lead to harmless comments removed, and, on the other hand, harmful comments published. https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/02/04/the-role-of-bias-in-artificial-intelligence/?sh=3bf5308b579d
__label__Evidence	gender-neutral language is unnecessary.
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars will always have the possibility to glitch out like any other computer, however in this instance the consequences are much more severe.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Evidence	hate speech will be reduced
__label__Evidence	I agree there must be standards. Good point made there.
__label__Evidence	some species are endangered and threatened by poaching. zoos are a place were we can guarantee their safety and survival.
__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading allows for quicker and more effective trading than can be conducted by a human investor.
__label__Position	Research shows that letting comments proliferate with little oversight is a “dangerous recipe,” Andincivility and negative comments can have a long-term impact. Certain commenting software use algorithms meant to flag problematic comments, but machines can only do so much. Should newspapers really be spending already depleted resources on monitoring comments?
__label__Evidence	a successful targeted killing can prevent a war or other deaths and as such, should be a tool at our disposal.
__label__Position	A moderated comments section can solve this problem. Freedom of speech does not need to include hate speech. An opinion can be given that doesn't include hate speech in it.
__label__Evidence	The crackers regulated in the market comprise chemical components like saltpeter, carbon, and sulfur. When these are ignited altogether, hazardous oxides of gases are emitted which cause suffocation, reduce visibility, and other health hazards.

__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Evidence	In an ideal world perhaps, but how would you recognise 'hate speech' and police this in practical terms without infringing civil liberties and free speech. AI offers one avenue, but many challenges remain and there are many risks with this approach: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0221152
__label__Evidence	we should ban missionary work because pushing personal views on unwanted audiences is wrong.

__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	One user by the name of AndreaP said in order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section Newspapers should be one sided providers. I strongly disagree with this argument. It is very autocratic and happens a lot in countries where media and citizens does not have freedom and oppressed by harsh leadership. Comments in newspapers help many to get raw information from the ground and open minds of many to see issues differently from differing opinions. Indeed comments section are necessary

__label__Evidence	telemarketing shouldn't be banned, this is a free country and people have the right to call others and solicit items.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Evidence	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Evidence	I agree with this comment. I really would encourage people to educate other people about the consequences and reasons behind hate speech. These factors might contribute to reduce it
__label__Evidence	people have the right to express themselves.
__label__Evidence	this could save and enhance many lives that are already here, living! why should people needlessly suffer when answers could be found yet mostly looked down upon because of biblical reasons.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Position	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Evidence	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Evidence	Zoos are unnatural places for wild animals to live and causes many of them to live long, sad lives in cages.
__label__Evidence	If someone is booked under UAPA, the burden of proving their innocence is on them. This new amendment is enabling the government to seize their properties. Then how will they pay for legal expenses to prove their innocence, if they are falsely accused?
__label__Evidence	The British people voted for Brexit, so now naturally they have to live with their choice. It turns out you can't actually have your cake and eat it too.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Evidence	we shouldn't abolish zoos because they create jobs for zookeepers and they allow children to view wild animals which is fun and educational
__label__Position	Being vegan doesn't solve the collective issue of big farming and the drastic loss of biodiversity. Carbon footprint is not the singular way to measure sustainability.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Position	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Evidence	Removing all comments as a blanket measure is appropriate as it moves the conversations to other spaces. Newspapers should be for news, objective, they are no place for opinions
__label__Evidence	Legalizing organ trade will cause organs to go to the highest bidder rather than to those most in need.
__label__Evidence	telemarketing is annoying at best and an invasion of privacy at its worst.
__label__Evidence	one-tone approach
__label__Evidence	I agree and also that some comment may not have been posed to upset/hurt, but can do, so educating people in how to respond would be a good thing.
__label__Position	You should be allowed to give your opinion to express your view about a news article. To moderate this or to filter what you can and cannot say would it stop it from being free speech. What really needs to be looked at is to see how you can stop online trolling which I think is the root cause of some of these comment sections become so toxic. But for the media who is so depended on free speech themselves so that they can report on news in an unbiased way to eliminate the comment space is almost hypocritical. Just a weird idea here but perhaps you should do a quick test or verification before you can comment. A lot of people would not go through the effort of completing this if they just want to spread hate.
__label__Evidence	We should not end mandatory retirement because it opens up positions to women, people of color, and immigrants who were not able to take those jobs due to past discrimination.
__label__Evidence	cannabis impairs the mind and can put others in potential danger (driving)
__label__Evidence	we use whales for many usable products.
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Evidence	space exploration is a waste of time and money and we should focus on sustaining earth
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.

__label__Evidence	the is enough money in journalism already, and funds available through subsidies should be redirected towards more worthwhile causes such as healthcare.
__label__Position	Human populations are approaching carrying capacity on planet Earth. The scientific community thinks this is a number on the order of 9 to 10 billion people. Without population control, there can be no effective solution for reversing the effects of human-induced climate change.
__label__Position	Hate speech should not be tolerated but its curtailing should not be prioritised over freedom to comment. Ultimately, private companies (online newspapers) are free to restrict comment sections in any way they see fit but ideally we should be allowing free discussion with a robust moderation system in place.
__label__Evidence	As per a study published by the Academy of Management Journal in 2021, moonlighting can provide a sense of control and motivation, which can improve the productivity of employees.
__label__Evidence	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Evidence	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	Newspapers should definitely not censor users but should come up with other measures to restrict users with malicious intent. Such mechanisms can be only registered users being allowed to comment and for the comments to be public. Mechanisms such as AI bots which trace keywords that promote hate speech can be utilised by newspaper agencies.
__label__Evidence	factory farming should be banned because it increases the risk of animal cruelty
__label__Position	I think newspapers should leave their comment sections open to allow for feedback from their readers. Although, it is important for them to also pay attention to moderating divisive comments from other readers.
__label__Evidence	We should not legalize the organ trade as this will just monetize the transaction and people may feel they have to do live donations just to get some money.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Evidence	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Evidence	We should not abolish the right to keep and bear arms as this is our fundamental right and should not be something for debate.
__label__Evidence	the church of scientology is a cult and it should be banned.
__label__Evidence	I agree,the should be someone who's hired to check comment and to block.Also those who bully people shoul not be allowed on the site
__label__Evidence	some students need the extra protection and comfort.
__label__Position	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on absolute majority, not unanimity

__label__Evidence	we should subsidize wikipedia as they have done a tremendous job pulling together a humongous database of facts.
__label__Position	Newspapers should be neutral when reporting, however, nowadays that isnt the case and I feel they are the ones that actually instigate hate speech - negativity sells and if they can get as much reaction they will go to any lenghts to do so. In order to fairly reduce the hate speech from readers comments it has to be heavily moderated, personal details required in order to make a comment and possibly have a word block or something where the comment is replaced with "this goes against our hate speech policy"
__label__Evidence	I think that is a very good idea
__label__Evidence	an austerity regime can help lower debt throughout the country
__label__Evidence	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Evidence	Mandatory retirement affirms problematic stereotypes about the competency of older people which prevents them from being taken seriously when they should be.
__label__Evidence	the olympic games are a huge waste of money to the host countries. they spend large amounts of money to build places that are never used again.
__label__Evidence	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Evidence	Whaling should be banned because it is barbaric and over-killing is causing whales to become an endangered species.
__label__Evidence	the olympic games should be abolished because they are a financial drain on host cities
__label__Evidence	autonomous cars can make driving more dangerous since their programming can not cover every conceivable instance.
__label__Evidence	By our actions many species have been made extinct and the chemistry of the gasses that make up our atmosphere have been altered.Climate change caused extinctions are permanent, it follows therefore we cannot wind back the clock.
__label__Evidence	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Position	It still seems important to focus more on reporting the news and far less on giving a newspapers opinion of the news. But straight news doesn't make the clicks or the money. Looking at the current changes to CNN are a good indication that anger sells and straight news does not.The anger is what keeps the comments sections alive.
__label__Evidence	we should legalize prostitution because it gets prostitutes off the street
__label__Evidence	people should be free to live like they wish
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	Children do not have sufficient autonomy to make decisions about careers, they should be protected from over directing parents and hence the use of child actors should be banned.
__label__Position	I would disagree richard, newspapers can often fuel hate speech through their phrasing and the way they choose to title their articles therefore it is down to them to avoid hate speech spreading on their websites.
__label__Evidence	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Evidence	We should not end mandatory retirement because the world is already over-populated and people need to retire so that others can back-fill their jobs.
__label__Evidence	telemarketers exist only to scam people out of their money. they lie and use dishonest marketing tactics to get consumers to bend to their will.
__label__Evidence	economic sanctions are often a proportional punishment
__label__Evidence	We already have successful programs for students from refugee camps. Enhance that.
__label__Evidence	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Evidence	A lot of programs nowadays sound really good on paper, but there always is someone bending the rules. There needs to be outside monitoring in every youth program of that sort
__label__Evidence	You are justifying the genocide of indigenous Europeans who, when asked, always reject these 'refugees'.
__label__Evidence	Great! I have a similar approach
__label__Evidence	les modérateurs ont un rôle important à jouer mais, en fonction du flux de commentaires, il peut-être difficile à mettre en œuvre.
__label__Evidence	zoos do very important work for conservation. their breeding programmes have stopped some species from becoming extinct.
__label__Evidence	space exploration is such a costly exercise that subsidising would put an enormous strain on any country's finances that can be ill afforded when there are so many more causes that need supporting on earth.
__label__Evidence	most of the electric power is produced by thermal power plants that burn oil derivatives and by the nuclear industry. So, until the electric power generation won't be mostly by renewable energies, is basically irrelevant which kind of cars are we using.
__label__Evidence	we have seperation of church and state for a reason. schools are a government entity that is not suppose to be involved with, or support, any particular religion and the two need to stay seperate.
__label__Evidence	if a zero tolerance policy in schools is adopted, this will impinge on the rights of the pupils to challenge decisions they may deem unfair or unfit.
__label__Evidence	prostitution is harmful and degrading to women and by legalizing it you are only reinforcing the stereotypes that already exist
__label__Evidence	we should ban algorithmic trading because most people have no idea how it works and if it is good for them or not
__label__Position	We should end mass immigration and support Europeans in having the resources to have more children
__label__Evidence	I completely agree, everyone should have the chance to give an opinion and also agree or disagree with the points in an article, however there is no room for hate speech. The best way to achieve an ability to comment on online newspaper articles and websites is to allow free speech but to regulate comments so as to avoid nasty hate speech, people then making such hateful comments could then be blocked from further comments.
__label__Evidence	they should be allowed if they are medically necessary.
__label__Evidence	We need to stop all funding to NGOs and all migration organizations within the EU. Then can we talk about how to help the people already here and how to help real people in need.
__label__Evidence	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Evidence	IT is absoluety the websites job to police polirising comments if nesccearry to keep peace wihthin the outiside community viewing their newspapers.
__label__Position	Hate speech could be reduced by having word filters and hiring moderators that stick to specific guidelines and giving users warnings about their behavior
__label__Evidence	I think this is a good idea, but unfortunately it's framed as a British/brexit issue. However, the wider concept of a common EU visa / migration system is a compelling one. Harmonising the system to a common visa regime offers many advantages.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Evidence	zoo's are horrid places that keep animals in tiny cages and then charges the public high prices to see them.
__label__Evidence	we should not ban telemarketing since it would eliminate many jobs. it also is an effective way for a company to get much needed leads for their products or services if done correctly.
__label__Position	I found this interesting article on how the United Nations suggests people react to hate speech directed at them or their organisation. https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/take-action/engage
__label__Evidence	I agree with you, anonymity does seem to increase the level of hate speech and trolling. I found this article interesting though, it talks about the risks of splintering the internet if AI is used to limit speech too strongly.

__label__Evidence	executive compensation could encourage money laundering and corruption
__label__Evidence	It is an easy programming process to do so.
__label__Evidence	school uniforms will stop children from wearing and showing offense logos, words, etc., to their peers.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.

__label__Evidence	one of the few comments i agree with

__label__Evidence	we should stop the development of autonomous cars because autonomous cars are bad idea, very dangerous
__label__Evidence	Giving a killer the death sentence will stop them doing it again
__label__Position	In my opinion, we need a large number of moderators in the comment sections who can quickly delete or censor hateful comments. But for all that it is necessary that these sections are not subjected to a too big censorship so that people can continue to express themselves freely
__label__Evidence	zoos are an unnatural stressful environment for animals. no animal should have to live in a cage or enclosure just for the entertainment of people, it is cruel and unnecessary.
__label__Evidence	the church of scientology is a cult and can lead to abuse as it is not regulated or observed in the same way that traditional, longstanding religions are.
__label__Position	Do not allow comments, they are unnecessary. Discussion should occur on other public forums. We don't conduct discussions by writing on a newspaper and leaving it on a train for other poeple to write their comments on it.
__label__Position	We should develop a strategy for the EU defense in relation to NATO
__label__Evidence	I agree, there should be a policy on what is considered hate speech therefore making easy to censor hate speech

__label__Evidence	we must have more options to choose and leave this bipartisan dictatorship
__label__Evidence	i think it takes up too much valuable police resources chasing recreational cannabis smokers.also many people with health conditions find cannabis beneficial to them.

__label__Evidence	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Evidence	we do not want to encourage a sexualised society becoming more immoral and oppressive of women
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Position	The comment section would need to be monitored, and other readers should be able to report comments

__label__Evidence	pride parades are a legacy of a by-gone time when equal rights for gay men and women was not on the horizon.
__label__Evidence	we need the cures and treatments we can get by funding stem cell research.
__label__Position	I don't think removing the comment section reduces hate speech per se, it just pushes it elsewhere. I can't help feeling this sort of censorship is an infringement on free speech.
__label__Position	Perhaps vetting people more thoroughly would be a solution?
__label__Evidence	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Evidence	I agree that it is impossible for a human moderator to read every comment and react quick enough to an offensive comment before it has been read by other commentators.
__label__Evidence	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Evidence	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Position	The newspaper websites should have AI bots that are able to detect negative comments and strong hate words so they are able to monitor which comments should be posted or not
__label__Evidence	we live in a country of freedom of speech and this is embodied in the celebration of diversity such as pride parades.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Evidence	people should not be forced to be in uncomfortable or distasteful situations and safe spaces provide a haven from this.

__label__Evidence	nuclear weapons have the ability to destroy the entire human race and should be banned.
__label__Evidence	Africa has a lot of bright young people with sometimes incredible ideas. If these young people create for example remote learning opportunities for African students, we should not only sponsor such projects but make exchange possible for young people in Europe to create similar items for example to foster MINT skills throughout Europe. Give more opportunities for young people from both sides to meet, exchange, and ventilate new ideas.
__label__Evidence	embryonic stem cell research helps to provide innovations in cancer treatment as well as help in the treatment of patient's with diseases such as parkinson's disease, subsidizing would allow for more funding.

__label__Evidence	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Evidence	I think DominicJ is onto something however with technology being on our finger tips and Artificial intelligence making things easier i think having a software that can be able to restrict those criteria can be a good thing and will be automated
__label__Evidence	scientology is actually a wealthy cult and members are abused physically and financially.
__label__Evidence	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Evidence	making individuals aware

__label__Evidence	mandatory retirement forces people to end careers before they are ready
__label__Evidence	gender-neutral language adheres to both sexes without a preference of one gender over the other.
__label__Evidence	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Position	Removing the comment section should not be an option, we should not lose the right to freedom of speech based on the likelihood that a few may post hateful comments, strict moderation and being able to report hate speech is the solution. Having people sign up for platforms and use ID to which they could be held personally accountable is an option as well. Hate Speech often comes from being able to hide behind a keyboard, screen and a fake username.
__label__Position	sorry but we all have an opinion which we are allowed to express but we should also be respectful of others opinions,we should not actively give out hurtful words!
__label__Evidence	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.

__label__Evidence	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

__label__Evidence	In many of India’s engineering colleges, we can easily pass the subjects even if do not have much knowledge in those subjects. That is the reason many companies are not able to find suitable talent even if there are so many eligible graduates.

__label__Evidence	minors should have a choice in what to do with their bodies
__label__Evidence	completly agree
__label__Evidence	I'm not very sure that an automated system is the answer. There are many cases of false positives, particularly when other users attempt to have a discussion with the offender. The machine picks up on keywords used commonly in hate speech and the users attempting a discussion may use these keywords as well.

__label__Position	I think will be fair to eliminate the space because everyone needs to give their opinion so it must be better to come up with a solution to block those who post hate speech
__label__Evidence	I totally disagree with this, If the newspaper is not the place for comments then where would they get the platform to voice out their convictions
__label__Evidence	like other churches, the church of scientology needs to be protected via the separation of church and state.
__label__Evidence	I am happy to see that the ide of haling all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is still going strong. This message needs to be communicated to Brussels very clearly.
__label__Evidence	Not only for committing, but also planning. Especially if an immigrant gets caught planning a terrorist act, he/she must be removed from EU permanently.
__label__Evidence	the olympic games are usually a drain on the economy of the host city
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Evidence	an embryo is basically a baby that has not implanted yet. this is potential human life.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	Research shows that letting comments proliferate with little oversight is a “dangerous recipe,” Andincivility and negative comments can have a long-term impact. Certain commenting software use algorithms meant to flag problematic comments, but machines can only do so much. Should newspapers really be spending already depleted resources on monitoring comments?

__label__Evidence	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Evidence	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Evidence	Moderators are useful but they will have their own bias and we cannot guarntee that they will be impartial, thus we remain in the same position
__label__Evidence	Broad stroke policies like banning cosmetic surgery harm people in special circumstances who really need cosmetic surgery.
__label__Evidence	more online platform needs a moderator role, too often you see posts on social media that have rampant hate speech going unfiltered and the commenter going unpunished
__label__Position	Unfortunately, the public's view on acts of terrorism (including domestic) can be strongly swayed by the effective use of such innocent feeling things as comment sections, as these groups may flood such sections underneath reporting of their own acts with sympathetic or 'this isn't an issue' type posts, thus influencing others' opinions directly or indirectly.

__label__Evidence	private military compnaies do not have the dedication to uphold the lives of citizens, resulting in collateral damage of human lives.
__label__Position	How do you propose this to be executed?
__label__Evidence	Media isn't about sparking debate it's about catching our attention, profiting off our attention and sharing their biased view with us. Some countries have tighter regulations for media than others as well, plus they write salacious headlines for sale knowing people won't always read the full text of the article. They cause the polarization in conversation.

__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Evidence	It isn't perfect but it is a pretty decent %
__label__Position	Moderation is the key to this argument, people like to talk and to share opinions, the newspapers readability might suffer if this is removed. there should be an algortithm censoring speech before it is posted and there should be an option to dispute if a statement is hate speech or not, which should then be reviewed by humans. Also it is very important to distinguish between hate speech and diferent opinions. Censorship should not equal an avenue to bully people.
__label__Evidence	libertarianism is the ultimate expression of freedom.
__label__Position	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Position	We should adopt an extension of the application of qualified majority voting arrangements
__label__Position	i think the comment section of any newspaper is very important and helps the newspaper understand how it's readers are feeling. it shouldn't be a difficult task to find a way to reduce Hate within the comments.

__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Evidence	I don't think they do. From what I see some newspapers want to know exactly how people feel even if what is written causing a bit of chaos
__label__Evidence	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Evidence	government today has way too much influence in our daily lives; libertarianism seeks to reduce said interference, while possibly also reducing the amount of money the government spends.
__label__Evidence	i think capital punishment is useful for some people because it turns them into better people
__label__Evidence	adopting a multi-party system leads to the formation weak and unstable coalition governments
__label__Position	I agree with the notion that being able to share our thoughts and feelings is a right and having people share their views can help people to question their own thoughts. The inclusion of moderators to prevent people from posting discriminatory or harmful comments would be good, but difficult to ensure these moderators aren't biased towards one argument
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Evidence	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.

__label__Evidence	Because nuclear weapons kill indiscriminately and inevitably harm civilians, they can never be used as a legitimate or just weapon of war.
__label__Evidence	I agree, I think and AI could filter this faster than a person. Also giving people to opportunity to report will help as well.
__label__Evidence	religion gives people a belief if a better life

__label__Evidence	no two people are entirely alike. ignoring individual differences and needs does not best serve the whole
__label__Evidence	Knowing the rules, unfortunately, doesn't mean that people respect them. There's a lot of hate speech on Facebook and a lot of it goes unnoticed.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Evidence	targetted killing could potentially help reduce the number of crimes if terrorists are killed before they can cause more harm
__label__Evidence	subsidizing journalism would give the government control over it
__label__Evidence	we should not ban whaling because it provides jobs and food for people.

__label__Position	The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is interestingly tackled in this article

__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.

__label__Position	using key words and having moderators might help
__label__Evidence	Article 15 of Indian constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender. But the proposed law on marital rape in the petitions recognizes only female victims. Hence it is discriminatory to male victims.
__label__Position	A lot of the times I hear people railing against the censorship of hatespeech it is because they aren't aware of the damage they are causing or have been caught out saying something they didn't think was bad to begin with. I think that anything that is removed should be explained to the poster as well as the impact that t could have on other people
__label__Evidence	There is little difference between the whaling industry and our farming industries; humans are entitled to hunt animals to eat them and utilize them to our benefit.

__label__Evidence	algorithmic trading is cost effective because it is timely and accurate.
__label__Evidence	the operating personnel of these companies has been working for the army of the nation. this type of company keeps them active and always ready to defend if necessary.
__label__Evidence	I agree. As per 'The Free Speech Balancing Act of Digital Intermediaries: An explication of the concept of content governance' (Johnson, Brett (2015)' online news outlets face several competing duties: to promote free speech, to prevent harm, to obey the law, and to make money. Their entire business model relies on discourse and to prevent that is to deny readers/users the very service they claim to be providing. Some kind of voting system would allow harmful comments to be surpressed by the users themselves. It should really be left to the platforms themselves to figure out a way to manage potential hate speech (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00550-7#Sec4) through their own platforms as they have a responsibility to both limit harmful speech but keep discussion free and open.
__label__Evidence	Yes I agree, I feel that we are probably fairly used to sifting through the rubbish on the internet, and at times the trolls can be entertaining, as long as it isn't nasty.
__label__Evidence	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	Serbia should join the EU.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Evidence	telemarketing is considered a nuisance to many and other forms of advertising are much more effective and less invasive.
__label__Evidence	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Evidence	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Evidence	we should adopt a zero tolerance policy in schools because it will scare kids into behaving
__label__Evidence	targeted killing is an immoral act, a government procured murder, that should not continue.
__label__Position	I believe the most appropriate action is to use a combination of computer algorithms and human moderation to monitor and remove hate language. It is important that this doesn't simply become censorship but should be focused on comments that are used to hurt, demean or offend others.
__label__Evidence	the cells used in stem cell research come from the murdering, harvesting, and selling of babies, all of which are highly immoral.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Evidence	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Evidence	this is a great way to monitor the section
__label__Evidence	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Evidence	people need the freedom to drive where they want by themselves.

__label__Evidence	we shouldn't legalize prostitution because it may cause higher percentage of drug rates and crimes along with prostitution rates

__label__Evidence	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
