__label__Attack	We cannot invest trillions in an attempt to reverse climate change, without first knowing that is possible, manageable and achievable in a reasonable amount of time
__label__Support	If governments around the world treat climate change collectively - the same way they treated World War 2 for instance - then is possible, no matter the cost
__label__Support	It is getter harder year by year by still possible.
__label__Support	yes I go with the statement saying If governments around the world treat climate change collectively - the same way they treated World War 2 for instance - then is possible, no matter the cost
__label__Support	We need to take immediate steps and put a full stop on organisation who are playing with our future just for a quick buck.
__label__Support	While I agree that it is getting harder every year, we need to do something about it now. It's never going to be an easy process, but the sooner we start, the better. We need to make drastic changes now so that policy and consumer interaction can be at the level necessary to move things in the correct direction.
__label__Attack	Many technologies like electric vehicles still plug into the grid and use fossil fuels. We do not have a zero emission grid yet.
__label__Support	I agree that we have to try. There is no quitting.
__label__Attack	Even if it is getting harder we have to at least try.
__label__Support	Obviously it is getting harder. Each year more damage is done and we cannot deny the inevitable.
__label__Attack	But is it even possible to fix now or is it too far gone?
__label__Support	If we try to make a serious attempt we can definitely reverse the harmful effects.
__label__Attack	It is not possible to technically change the climate problem
__label__Support	I totattluy disagree because.....
__label__Attack	If we do noting, we'll be all dead in 100 years
__label__Support	We can only do the best we can with the technology we have right now.
__label__Support	of course the feedback loops will contribute but the question is how much
__label__Attack	but how fast is it progressing and can we slow it enough to even make a difference?
__label__Support	Because people are flawed and invested in themselves first, it is hard to get cooperation from all sides to do something about a polarizing thing like climate.
__label__Support	What do you consider the feedback loops, first we have to list them.
__label__Support	Adaptation and fighting climate change often go hand in hand
__label__Attack	We cannot adopt but we should adopt to it because there is no other go with the affected environment unless helping the environment less pollution
__label__Attack	Since most of the climate change is caused by big organisations, I dont think just adapting to climate change is the right thing to say. There is a lot that is out of our hands.
__label__Support	I agree that we, as humans, can adapt to the situation as best as possible. But we can also take small steps towards change. The situation doesn't have to be impossible.
__label__Support	We do have to adapt and evolve with the shifting climate. It's too late to halt the process entirely.
__label__Position	We can only achieve by tremendous advances and investment in technology: clean energy production, CO2 capture in massive scale, hydrogen planes, ... , and much much more
__label__Attack	Technology is not our savior. We need to reduce overall consumption and adopt more sustainable practices on a massive scale.
__label__Attack	It seems that massive industrial scale projects are what caused climate change. Large scale industry is a major cause of pollution.
__label__Support	CO2 reaches historic levels everyday.When it is control the climate change returned normal condition.Unless future will be in worst condition.
__label__Attack	Yes the costs are very high and most technologies in the [past have failed such as wind turbines etc which need electricity which cancels the effort
__label__Attack	But who is going to pay for all thee changes? Big business surely will not foot the bill and pour own government in the USA is in so much debt already that we are nearing an economic collapse
__label__Attack	Already we are ruin the nature to observe the CO2 and other gases.Now we are expecting the solution in technology side.It is not fully solution for change the climate.So we want to focus the nature resources management.
__label__Attack	Human spoiled the nature to a great extent and they have to face the consequences and should avoid doing more harm to the environment any further.
__label__Position	Technology can not correct this problem unless u can grow more trees as quick as possible using technology.
__label__Position	Human spoiled the nature to a great extent and they have to face the consequences and should avoid doing more harm to the environment any further.
__label__Position	I am sorry but NO. Almost the whole human civilisation runs of fossil fuels pumped from the deep carbon cycle to the fast carbon cycle. It will reverse naturally over several million years, not the short-term which we can benefit from right now.
__label__Support	I agree with this. With that being said, we as consumers need to demand more from the same organizations. We need to go to all levels of government and demand that these same organizations give us alternatives in the form of electric and hydro cars while also proving that we are ready to purchase them to give these same organizations incentive to play along.
__label__Support	I completely agree with this. There are multiple exposes and car engineering shows were independent organizations show not only that we can reduce carbon emissions, but that we can also run cars way more efficiently with our current fossil fuels. If people demand the same level of efficiency with future fossil fuel using vehicles we can begin to make real changes. This will in turn give us the time necessary to begin building the infrastructure necessary for those alternative fuel sources as we will need to build electric gas stations and charge stations around the country before demanding an increase in those alternative vehicles from organizations.
__label__Attack	we need to adopt to the current situation , we should not deny that we are responsible for all the problem that we create in accordance with situation
__label__Position	yes I go with the statement saying If governments around the world treat climate change collectively - the same way they treated World War 2 for instance - then is possible, no matter the cost
__label__Attack	Even though damage is done, there are ways to counter the damage through other actions. If enough of these are done, they can cumulatively overpower the irreversible actions and thus reduce climate change as a net overall.
__label__Attack	Technology may increase to where it can be - like developing time travel.
__label__Attack	This should be part of every single citizen mendality in this planet. Assuming that this is a problem of someone else, then we will lose the fight before it even starts!
__label__Position	If you are ready to harm the nature by using technology then get ready to find a solution or alternative to nature if possible to protect the climate and environment.
__label__Attack	Physicist Stephen Hawkings warns that we are close to the tipping point, but climate change can be reversed if the human race acts now.
__label__Attack	Greenhouse gases were drastically higher when the dinosaurs walked, and earth survived just fine. Climate change can always be reversed, the question is simply how much effort over what period of time.
__label__Position	Today the growing population is struggling to live with the available resources as it is not sufficient to meet the demands of the people , so they have to interfere with the nature and exploiting it . You can say they are using more and more chemical in agriculture to grow more and fast which is not at all good for the human ultimately and to the nature.
__label__Position	We are simply not prepared to give up on our modern lifestyle to achieve this. Nobody wants to give up his cheap flight to exotic destinations, his big petrol car, cheap electricity, ...
__label__Position	Human populations are approaching carrying capacity on planet Earth. The scientific community thinks this is a number on the order of 9 to 10 billion people. Without population control, there can be no effective solution for reversing the effects of human-induced climate change.
__label__Support	There is a spread of policies that come under the heading of population control ranging from the coercive to the persuasive.

__label__Position	Conservation of resources may end up where it's eventually undone by someone who takes them, as nature doesnt like a void.So climate change can be neutral at best and getting worse at worst with this principle.
__label__Support	By our actions many species have been made extinct and the chemistry of the gasses that make up our atmosphere have been altered.Climate change caused extinctions are permanent, it follows therefore we cannot wind back the clock.

__label__Support	Educating people (such as making it mandatory in the school system) on how to reverse climate change can give people the option to make positive changes to the situation.
__label__Attack	All we can do is reduce our impact but not reverse it.Unfortunately is statistically inevitable

__label__Support	With entropy, all efforts to restore the atmospheric gas balance will still leave a lot of the changes to the worldfor a very long time.Mitigation might be all we can do at this point,rather than being able to fully reverse it.

__label__Attack	Greenhouse gases were drastically higher when the dinosaurs walked, and earth survived just fine. Climate change can always be reversed, the question is simply how much effort over what period of time.
__label__Position	Climate change is anyways is a hoax! 31,000 scientists reject global warming and say "no convincing evidence" that humans can or will cause global warming
__label__Support	There is a spread of policies that come under the heading of population control ranging from the coercive to the persuasive.
__label__Support	Agree, the biggest contributors of CO2 emissions (USA and China) should do the most effort to reverse this
__label__Attack	This should be part of every single citizen mendality in this planet. Assuming that this is a problem of someone else, then we will lose the fight before it even starts!
__label__Position	Adaptation and fighting climate change often go hand in hand
__label__Attack	i agreed it. because this is only by our hand to protect our planet from this climate change issue. so we have to should use green energy sources only in future.
__label__Support	pro 1
__label__Position	Human populations are approaching carrying capacity on planet Earth. The scientific community thinks this is a number on the order of 9 to 10 billion people. Without population control, there can be no effective solution for reversing the effects of human-induced climate change.
__label__Support	There is a spread of policies that come under the heading of population control ranging from the coercive to the persuasive.
__label__Attack	we have alternate way to think this problem. human population control is may be possible one way. but other way we have to follow and find alternate solution for this climate change problems like find reusable energy sources and green sources. mainly control co2 pollution through vehicles.
__label__Attack	There are a lot of moral issues to consider when talking about things like population control. Issues like these have been in public policy for decades without a solution.
__label__Attack	Population experts expect that the world's population will plateau in several decades without any coercion. Educating people about effective means of birth control and social responsibility could have some effect of speeding the leveling of the population sooner. There doesn't seem to be the need for drastic measures.
__label__Attack	I don't think that we should choose either mitigation or adaptation. It seems that both are very useful tools to fight climate change and other environmental concerns.
__label__Attack	I don't think that simply mitigating the problem should be our focus.
__label__Position	Climate change science is inconclusive.
__label__Support	I do agree. I do believe there is some impact on climate due to man's activity but this has been studied over such a short term that I am skeptical of any hard and definite conclusion.
__label__Attack	Imagine how terrible we all would feel if we made the planet cleaner for everyone only to find out it was a hoax?
__label__Support	Educating people (such as making it mandatory in the school system) on how to reverse climate change can give people the option to make positive changes to the situation.
__label__Support	I gree because....
__label__Position	Conservation of resources may end up where it's eventually undone by someone who takes them, as nature doesnt like a void.So climate change can be neutral at best and getting worse at worst with this principle.

__label__Position	Some damage towards the climate is currently irreversible to prevent reversal in time.
__label__Support	By our actions many species have been made extinct and the chemistry of the gasses that make up our atmosphere have been altered.Climate change caused extinctions are permanent, it follows therefore we cannot wind back the clock.

__label__Attack	Technology may increase to where it can be - like developing time travel.
__label__Position	For some people, "Man made climate change" begs the question. While I might not be one of them, I'll say assuming climate change is indeed man made, all we can do is reduce our greenhouse gas generation. This will require the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources to be prioritized more than it currently is.
__label__Support	It should be taught to children to make the world cleaner and safer for all animals.
__label__Position	I agree it is going to need a world effort to combat climate change. Not just a few rich countries trying to.
__label__Attack	Countries still catching up to the industrial revolution will argue it unfair.
__label__Position	Also, it is always better to do something than nothing, and then regretting it.
__label__Position	I am sorry but NO. Almost the whole human civilisation runs of fossil fuels pumped from the deep carbon cycle to the fast carbon cycle. It will reverse naturally over several million years, not the short-term which we can benefit from right now.

__label__Position	we need alternative technology also population control. large population need large resources.its bad. we need alternative and new technologies.
__label__Support	There is a spread of policies that come under the heading of population control ranging from the coercive to the persuasive.
__label__Position	I feel that climate change is happening on some level, but question how much of it is due to a natural cycle and how much to human activity. When it comes to stopping pollution and protecting the earth, I am on board. Where I draw the line is using climate change as a platform to implement socialist policies and take excessive freedoms from people.
__label__Position	And the Govt must give rewards to those who do activities to protect the environment.
__label__Attack	I tend to think that the government subsidizes too much already
__label__Position	I think the idea of the government rewarding people who participate in activities to protect the environment is a very good idea. It would encourage people to do that more.
__label__Position	I f we reduce usage of contaminating earth stuff eventually the earth will heal itself. The earth is a wonderous thing. Now the problem eventually will not be whether the earth can recover it will be if humans can survive in the toxic atmosphere created by humans. The earth will be here a long time its life that will become extinct. Focus more on not what will happen to the earth but what will happen to life on earth.
__label__Support	Well said, its been here this long, I think its safe to assume it will stay that way for a long time.
__label__Position	Climate change will never be reversible, humans are humans and far to many either do not believe it is happenings or cannot find the time to do any thing about it. As it goes now life on earth will be in jeopardy before my grand kids get to be my age.
__label__Attack	How are we in jeopardy? The earth has made it this long, it will continue that way.
__label__Attack	Im not sure what the poor has to do with it
__label__Position	With the increase of humans on our planet, we need to understand resources are finite and adapt.
__label__Position	We can only achieve by tremendous advances and investment in technology: clean energy production, CO2 capture in massive scale, hydrogen planes, ... , and much much more
__label__Position	If we identify the negative feedback loops and break them, then we have a chance of slowing or even reversing climate change
__label__Position	We can only achieve by tremendous advances and investment in technology: clean energy production, CO2 capture in massive scale, hydrogen planes, ... , and much much more
__label__Position	To keep the refrigerant management and forest restoration helps to change the climate.It could take a very long period of time but coming decades are survive easily.
__label__Position	Policy makers have vested interests with industry to ignore signals of overshoot and straining risks. Whatever action will be taken too late and there is no way to prevent feedback loops
__label__Position	Policy makers have vested interests with industry to ignore signals of overshoot and straining risks. Whatever action will be taken too late and there is no way to prevent feedback loops
__label__Support	there are ways to hold them accountable if we could get people to pay enough attention and apply political pressure for them to act
__label__Position	Presentation: Have one or multiple members share their screen and give a short presentation, then open up to discussion. Share a challenge: Each person has a chance to share a challenge that they want feedback on and then gets time for other participants to give them feedback.
__label__Position	Climate change is accelerating - due to feedback loops- much faster that what humanity can -or is willing to- decelerate it. Unfortunately is not feasible with current technology
__label__Position	I don't have a hard stance on this because I do not feel knowledgeable enough about the issue to say for sure what my ideal solution would be. I agree it is a gigantic problem that needs to be met with urgency and importance by all of us. I don't know that we could reverse climate change, it seems most damage has been done, but I'm hopeful taking stronger actions now would at least help reverse some things, and prevent current issues from developing further. It's worth trying.
__label__Position	The rising temperature causes all the problems .The human cause of climate change is not disputed by any scientific body
__label__Attack	Not all scientists input is put into the public eye and if a scientist is against the propaganda than they just eliminate him from being heard
__label__Attack	I don't believe this really. There are scientists who definitely dispute that humans are a cause of climate change. They also cite many types of weather patterns that cycle over and over over thousands of years that are also part of the cause.
__label__Position	There are two groups of people. one who want to save the ecology and another group who want to exploit the environment for making money. unless strict rules are passed to stop the abuse of nature we cant save the nature and the environment
__label__Support	Sadly many businesses just don't care and are all about making $$$$ and abusing the environment over helping take care of the current ecological crisis
__label__Support	This makes so much sense, and its not like it cannot be done. Many countries during the lockdown for Covid, showed they could easily have one day a month or such to have no pollution days where it would help the environment immensely
__label__Attack	Lockdowns are not the answer to the problem. Look how the lockdowns for the virus have caused the economy to go downhill and the depression and bad effects on the people both socially and psychologically
__label__Support	Regularly scheduled mini lockdowns are a possible part of a solution. More ideas like these need to be formulated and multiple avenues have to be explored and implemented. It's not about one solution or one quick fix -- it's going to be about a number of different plans and programs working together to a unified solution made up of many segments.
__label__Support	Yes, During this lockdown days, the earth seems to be very good. But one day is not enough.
__label__Attack	But how the the average person avoid these companies big expensive ideas when they are just about making ends meet now?
__label__Attack	Then what happens to those who cannot afford to buy new vehicles and what about all the oil producing companies and businesses that will be ruined?
__label__Support	That is true. Every country should take adequate measures in preserving nature and environment.
__label__Attack	even electric cars are not great for the environment.
__label__Attack	C'est la construction en elle même qui produit du gaz à effet de serre. Que les voiture soient électrique ou qu'elles roulent avec du pétrole ne change rien.
__label__Attack	I think there are bigger fish to fry at the moment.
__label__Position	This conversation seems to be pointless as our opinions will probably never be heard by those who are in control and authority and by big government who controls the people. They are the ones that need to hear and listen to the people through forums and discussions
__label__Position	The worst thing we could do would be to continue to do nothing. That's what's gotten us into this mess in the first place. Technology is evolving rapidly; think of all the changes and advancements that have been made in the recent past. Perhaps a solution is around the corner and we just don't know what it is yet. We cannot give up.
__label__Position	Placing blame and/or trying to figure out who's at fault is pointless. It doesn't matter if it's the corporations, individuals, or natural processes--the problem exists, whatever the cause. And it has to be addressed, even if it's expensive, even if it's monumental, even if it seems impossible to solve--because without working toward a solution, our planet and ourselves will cease to exist.
__label__Position	I think that growing more trees can reverse the adverse effects of manmade climate change. Trees release fresh oxygen. Protecting the environment is the key to reversing the harmful effects of climate change. It is most important to preserve the natural environment and plant more trees. Trees release oxygen which is very good for health.
__label__Support	I think this is definitely important and will help but we need so much more than this. To me this is just one of the many important steps and changes we must make. All of these things and all of us working together can make a significant change.

Protecting the environment is the key to reversing the harmful effects of climate change. It is most important to preserve the natural environment and plant more trees. Trees release oxygen which is very good for health.
__label__Position	I think that if we don't do something to start combatting climate change today, literally nothing will be there in the future to worry about - no economy left if there's no livable Earth left to inhabit. We're going to have to address this at some point, why not now? I'm not convinced that we can reverse what has already been done (ie, extinct species), but we can change the course of the future.
__label__Position	I think that generally speaking, climate change can be corrected for the future. But we need big corporations to be on board, and the federal government to start mandating it.
__label__Position	I don't believe that we can reverse the climate change that we have already done at this point, because we're too far gone. That said, I think that we do have the ability to at least slow it down or change the current course as to not do any more damage.
__label__Position	Every year that passes we lose tools or opportiunities that could work to counteract climate change as well as more damage is added - therefore is -unfortunately- irrevrsible
__label__Attack	This is the main problem that we are facing in the climate issue because some peoples are not considering the climate change problem. So the environment awareness is less. We need to consider the climate change.
__label__Attack	More focus should go to mediate the effects than trying to reverse climate change
__label__Position	There are technological, economic and political considerations that we must make if we are to reverse a trend that might otherwise threaten our very existence.
__label__Position	Refrigerants currently cause emissions throughout their life cycles, but 90 percent of emissions happen at disposal.
__label__Position	Sustainable efforts reduce and reverse the global warming trend.
__label__Position	I feel that manmade climate change can be reversed by everyone working together and making sacrifices to improve the environment. It will be made possible by people figuring out ways to save on carbon emissions instead of taking the easiest route. If we can do that in more ways than one, we should be able to save the planet.
__label__Support	By our actions many species have been made extinct and the chemistry of the gasses that make up our atmosphere have been altered.Climate change caused extinctions are permanent, it follows therefore we cannot wind back the clock.
__label__Attack	Technology may increase to where it can be - like developing time travel.
__label__Attack	I believe we still can. We could live amore local life
__label__Position	Billionaires who make money by killing planet earth, should be shot to death. They are not understanding what they are doing. Their aim is only money.
__label__Position	Maybe. But all humanity should collectively act together with the lead of the big super powers. If USA and China stay out, I am afraid it would be useless
__label__Attack	This should be part of every single citizen mendality in this planet. Assuming that this is a problem of someone else, then we will lose the fight before it even starts!
__label__Attack	In a neoliberal capitalist society, is hard to find incentives for "everyone working together" and "making sacrifices"
__label__Position	Rich nations rigged poor (powerless) nations. By choosing bio-fuel or dams solutions they just sentencing poor nations to extinction
__label__Support	NOT. To "sort" climate change we need to do a LOT, and one of those absolutely mandatory requirement is to use clean energy - no matter the cost
__label__Attack	arg1
__label__Position	I have heard that the Chile/Madrid Climate Change Conference Closes with Limited Ambition
__label__Support	True, I have read on one of the report on the COP205 that issues left unresolved included discussions on Article 6, common time frames, long-term finance, transparency issues for the Paris Agreement, report of the Adaptation Committee, and the report of the Consultative Group of Experts.
__label__Attack	That was COP25, I believe in this discussion we are trying to focus on COP26
__label__Position	This would have severe positive environmental advantages
__label__Attack	All the environment benefits can be achieved just by a vegetarian diet, you don't have to go fully vegan
__label__Support	Agree, think of CO2 emissions saved because of less caddle
__label__Support	also, less caddle means less incentives for deforestation
__label__Position	Enforcing what to eat to people is against principle of freedom - even if we talk about dietary options
__label__Support	Veganism is a choice, it should not be forced - especially to children
__label__Attack	If we raise our children with the same values like our generation did, then we are just fuelling the same viscous circle that destroys our planet
__label__Attack	this is extreme. I am sure we - as a humanity - can find a way to keep living in this planet while enjoying every once in a while a good steak.
__label__Position	Veganism, while more ethical, good for the environment, and healthier diet, is not feasible for a great proportion of the human population
__label__Position	In a lot of developing countries, dairy is a primary source of protein specially for kids. So no, this seems extreme.
__label__Position	Being vegan doesn't solve the collective issue of big farming and the drastic loss of biodiversity. Carbon footprint is not the singular way to measure sustainability.
__label__Position	We need a minimal set of protection measures (masks, ventilation...) in public spaces and public transportation.
__label__Support	This goes beyond just technical issues, it is also a matter of civilization for the general public to show it cares about fellow citizens with disabilities.
__label__Attack	But "personal liberty" can't be absolute: one person's liberty should not force another person into hiding. Also, the whole "state control" meme seems to be disingenous: in times of great crisis the state not only may but MUST intervene for the safety and security of all. That is the core reason for the state to exist.
__label__Support	Exactly, if not mandated there's also a strong negative social pressure effect where many people who are actually in favour of wearing masks don't dare to do so because of fear of being the social outlier or even treated aggressively.
__label__Position	position
__label__Position	make it so
__label__Attack	no it wont
__label__Position	No, I believe it would mute/cancel the freedom-of-speech spirit that should be contained within journalism.
__label__Position	No , I think that would seriously limit freedom of speech
__label__Attack	But too much freedom creates all the hate and toxicity we see in today's media
__label__Position	no, after all news paper should represent freedom of speech
__label__Position	No, free speech should be a right despite of the positive/negative approach
__label__Position	No, because the newspapers should only provide information and journalism, the hate speech should be condemned by the public, not censored by the newspaper
__label__Support	True spirit of journalism
__label__Attack	On the other hand it also eliminates the chance of reflections or beneficial interactions within the audience
__label__Attack	avoiding the issues does not eliminate it
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Position	No, everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Support	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Position	No, people have the right to express what they thing. But rather than removing access to comments, hate speech should be automatically flagged by the newspaper's website.
__label__Position	no, they could add some extension like IG to restrict some words and monitor comments as well. I believe removing hate speech is not against freedom-of-speech
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Position	If the moderation system is not well done, it is better to remove it but I think that it is better to leave this discussion space as long as moderators are present
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Position	Hate speech is hidden love that is just imperfectly expressed and should be protected
__label__Attack	quite an optimistic way to see it
__label__Attack	Nice point
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	The hate speech would obviously be reduced. However, if the comment section is totally removed, the rest of the comments which are important for knowing the opinions of the readers would also be removed.
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Position	preferences for extreme ethical opinions
__label__Attack	Human-based detection exists for certain content, but represents a really high cost for companies.
__label__Attack	No, there is human vetting processes also. But in many scenarios, the 1st round of filtering is done by automatic detections and then they go through human vetting, which may lead to scenarios with wrongly filtering comments.
__label__Support	but doesn't the detection ai get better at filtering the more it works?
__label__Attack	I do not agree...at all. Humans are biased by nature. They ideology, their vision of the world are their biasing drivers
__label__Position	it should target the insulting and violation to individual and groups right by law or common morality
__label__Position	when we talk about filtering the critical aspect that usually arise is the fact what would be the criteria who gonna decide what is hate speech and what is canceling people's right to speak
__label__Attack	But if people ́s right to speek is crossing the border towards hatered speech then you are disregarding another ́s right of respect
__label__Support	I agree, it's important to make sure that the way we design filtering criteria is not another centralized mechanism which undermines fairness.
__label__Support	This can be a very good 1st level of filtering, and maybe if there are situations which are red-flagged in high intensity, they can go through a human vetting process also.
__label__Support	sdfdsfsf
__label__Position	a proper solution is that by having a vote system the comments can be deleted by reaching to a specific point.
__label__Position	Lack of resources to create a more elaborate filtering system is a factor that can impact the process
__label__Position	what type of resources do you mean? You mena money to buy/implement a good filtering too, or human resources for filtering data? In both cases I think these are factors that can affect indeed the filtering quality and therefore its fairness
__label__Attack	Despite this there is woefully little work done to date on behaviour change and mobilisation within diverse groups, specifically in relation to ethnicity and disability
__label__Support	Major societal changes that will impact on all members of society are needed if we are to tackle climate change. Government, local councils, businesses, community and environmental organisations are all going to have to set targets and make difficult decisions. We need to ensure that there is active support for these changes from all parts of society.
__label__Position	We need an action programme to develop a more inclusive sector
__label__Support	Absolutely, and primarily any action has to be taken by civil society. There are examples of good practice within voluntary and non-governmental organisations but these are not yet common practice. The scale and balance of power needs to shift and resources found to develop this work as part of a core purpose.
__label__Support	A coordinated programme would be useful, but where do we start to build it? And Who should launch it?
__label__Position	To achieve diversity in tackling environmental issues we need to be ready to accept that a fair environmental policy would CANNOT MEAN treating anyone in the same way. Many people struggle with the concept and difference between equity and equality. As well put in this post: "Equality provides the same resources to all and pays little attention to the fairness of desired outcomes; while the practice of equity requires more foresight, and intentional allocation of resources tailored to individual needs to reach desired outcomes". https://www.trinet.com/insights/the-difference-between-equity-and-equality-and-why-both-matter
__label__Position	Knowledge on the subject should also be accessible and should be provided thorough multiple channels to reach our key audiences. I really enjoyed listening to IHBC @COP26 podcasts (see link) https://ihbc.org.uk/podcasts/
__label__Position	I have no knowledge to share, but perhaps I can use that positively by posing a few 'stupid' questions: - What are the threats to heritage buildings from climate change? - What are the threats to climate change from heritage buildings?
__label__Support	Many people have no idea what embodied carbon is, for example, and so some jargon-busting infomercials might be very helpful?
__label__Support	A very brief introduction to the effects of climate change on historic environments from Historic England can be found here: https://historicengland.org.uk/research/current/threats/heritage-climate-change-environment/what-effects/
__label__Support	Also links to Historic Englands Position Statements and Overviews on Climate Change here: https://historicengland.org.uk/whats-new/features/climate-change/
__label__Position	A discussion meeting to bring together key stakeholders and representatives from interested groups in Oxford could be an excellent way to start building a network and sharing knowledge and understanding. The Big Green Week at the end of September could be an opportunity to start this up! Start a list here of what you think key priorities and issues are!
__label__Position	The title of the discussion (increasing knowledge of all by all) is not related to its content (understanding the effects of climate change on historic buildings). therefore, there is disappointment and little engagement. For a good deliberation to work, its subject must be debated. But this is not exactly the case here.
__label__Support	This is a great approach that requires public funding too, to avoid wrong retro-fit choices to be made in heritage sites.
__label__Support	"The issue of consistency is a HUGE one. As a sector, we do our best but the Public Sector should focus on things such as the skill gap for instance" (Chris Jofeh, Consultant to Arup and Chair of the independent Decarbonisation of Homes in Wales Advisory Group)
__label__Position	Cost of upgrades, which are always higher for properties in a heritage setting, are unaffordable for individual owners in low wage, low property value areas.
__label__Support	"if costs of repair of heritage building becomes to high then the chances of these building to end in misreparis is very high" (Anna Beckett, Symmetrys)
__label__Support	If we are to retain these properties in use then their cost of ownership/occupancy must be made comparable with alternative properties. Options include ongoing financial support for operating costs, affordable upgrades to reduce operating cost.
__label__Position	"There is a disparity between planning policies and decarbonisation agenda at local authority level" (Paul Norman)
__label__Attack	These are not mutually exclusive, and sensitive decarbonisation proposals should meet with planning support. Planning is a balance.
__label__Position	"The scale of the heritage buildings problem is big, 125.000 buildings in 169 local authorities are managed by the Clarion Housing Group. The problem is not only about climate and heritage but most importantly about people" Paul Norman
__label__Support	Do you have a source reference? and replaces culture? (if heritage is added as the 4th) (Cherry)
__label__Position	"Great risk of unintended consequences of mass deep retrofit" (Crispin Edwards)
__label__Support	"E.g. rebound effect." (Crispin Edwards)
__label__Attack	The first and simple advice often given by one of my colleagues is “thicker curtains across window and doors” . It’s short term and achievable for residents while other interventions are in planning (John Preston)
__label__Position	" We should focus on quick wins while getting things organized with the industry properly" (Crispin Edwards)
__label__Support	specfically, enhancements to existing glazing such as draughtproofing, low emissivity films and blinds, insulated curtains, shutters, and secondary glazing
__label__Support	"Measures proposed that are inappropriate to building pathology" (Crispin Edwards)
__label__Attack	I think we should move internal toilets and bathrooms back outside as these are the greatest historic change in the moisture physics of buildings. Should we do this or embrace out inside toilets as a needed risk to the fabric of buildings to meet todays needs, just as we need to embrace IWI to meet future needs (Richard Lorch)
__label__Support	Traditional repairs are low carbon repairs. The industry hasn’t been training the repairers of 25%+ of the stock for over 60 years. Even the very expensive retrofit of New Court, Trinity College Cambridge had problems finding skilled people (John Preston)
__label__Support	If we don’t have the skills to upgrade 3000 heritage buildings a year, what do the panelists suggest for up-skilling the wider construction industry for the existing “non-heritage” building stock? (Richard Lorch)
__label__Attack	Skills needed for traditional as well as historic buildings. There have been qualifications in place for 10 years. The Scottish Govt has a retrofit Installer skills Matrix which requires qualifications if you work on an older building - why not in England too? This is basic risk management... (John Preston)
__label__Position	"Solutions for retrofitting" (Crispin Edwards)
__label__Support	"Government consistency re traditional buildings"
__label__Support	"Tools for homeowners, assessors, planners etc - STBA and others" (Crispin Edwards)
__label__Attack	Is central heating appropriate for many historic buildings (and the notion of wanting to maintain 19+ C) in these buildings? Do we need an alternative approach to the provision of thermal comfort? Should we aim to heat the whole building or just a few rooms? (Richard Lorch)
__label__Support	We should aim to heat people :) not buildings (Cherry)
__label__Support	Alexandra & Ainsworth Estate Camden by Neave Brown. Brutalist building unusual heating system, Grade II* listed. Freeholder is LB Camden, waiting to put an awful radiator scheme into the building and keep burning gas. Forcing their scheme into the building and keep burning gas. Forcing their scheme through and using the listing to not go further even though better options possible v. hard to challenge (Fiona Cubbin)
__label__Support	H ow are you tackling the trinity college Dublin project - what measures have you employed for this building? (Rachel Harris)
__label__Attack	You need to have professionals with the understanding, knowledge and skills to help owners of traditional buildings. (John Preston)
__label__Position	"If too expensive to adapt people wont do so, resulting in buildings in disrepair, and thus environmemtal and heritage loss" (Anna Beckett)
__label__Position	"We need to find the right balance between heritage preservation and continuous usability" (Anna Beckett)
__label__Support	"Indeed, adaptation and conversation sometimes in conflict" (Steven Bee)
__label__Support	"Climate Emergency Conservation Toolkit" in Islington a model for deciding what is locally acceptable" (Cristopher Jofeh)
__label__Attack	What works for Islington may not work across the country. Conservation policy work has always been constrained by lack of resources. It must be 30 years since we were trying to get govt to require Local Authorities to carry out Conservation Area Appraisals and keep them up to date. (John Preston)
__label__Support	"We also need time to reintroduce artisinal skills" (Steven Bee)
__label__Attack	"Tradtional skills training as part of a building conservation project has shown to be a successful approach" (Peter Cox)
__label__Attack	"Enticing people coming out of school to get into the sector, we need to make it sexy" (Paul Norman)
__label__Position	"The Heritage Council of Ireland recently run a course that reached 100 attendees and 70 waitlists) it was a huge success. A variety of UK Funding bodies should take this as a pilot and make it a virtual course that could be distributed to many more participants virtually." (Peter Cox)
__label__Position	"When the grid decarbonizes then a fair share of that made available to different building types" (Chris Twinn)
__label__Position	"How upgraded/comfortable should we make historic buildings?" (Kerry Mashford)
__label__Support	"We should encourage people to engage and enjoy living in these buildings" (Esther Robinson Wild)
__label__Support	"There are many people who can help with that" (Esther Robinson Wild)
__label__Position	"What types of legislative approaches are needed to allow for the right approaches in upgrading heritage buildings? (Kerry Mashford)
__label__Support	"More informed, well-advised people can make more courageous decisions" (Crispin Edwards)
__label__Position	"It is important to attract young people to study the built environment, sustainability, civil engineering, just as they currently focus on building new information systems. If we don't make these topics attractive to young students, the skills gap will only increase" (Paul Norman, Clarion Housing Group)
__label__Position	"We shouldn't be obessed by the numbers. Learning from the more difficult projects can feed into mainstream, unlocks potential value in the 20 of the 80/20" (Paul Norman)
__label__Position	"Existing building perhaps even less harmful from carbon view because it is already there, so even if less energy efficient maye be more efficient overall. Where is the cutoff point?" (Kerry Mashford summarizing chat)
__label__Support	"There should be a justification for ANY building being demolished" (Steven Bee)
__label__Support	"Example: 63 years to payback carbon for demolishing a building" (Peter Cox)
__label__Support	"EU is going to give a carbon credit for buildings that have been there for a long time" (Peter Cox)
__label__Support	"Starting in the middle: we don't demolish anything without justification, should be less driven by designated heritage status" (Steven Bee)
__label__Position	Heritage buildings includes the 30% of existing dwellings that are of traditional construction (solid walled or narrow 'rat-trap' cavity). Improving energy efficiency is important, but can be substantially achieved without deep retrofit, through a mix of appropriate repair, improvements to heating systems, enhancement of existing windows, and some insulation, as well as some behaviour change. Inappropriate retrofit will have unintended consequences including poor occupant health, fabric damage, harm to heritage value AND net carbon emissions. Relaxing regulation or weighing carbon emissions more heavily against heritage value would therefore be highly counterproductive.
__label__Position	It’s a matter of respect, to call a person the way ji wants to be called
__label__Position	Then we would need different names for animals, pets, and plants too. It would be ridiculous!
__label__Attack	Hey! This looks like slippery slope type of thinking
__label__Position	People will become dumber.
__label__Support	yes people will become dumber because they will train their brains power less
__label__Position	yes because people will rely on ai too much
__label__Attack	Some people may use AI responsibly
__label__Position	we should worried=== Lack Of Transperancy
__label__Position	Weapons automatization
__label__Position	Social media manipulation through AI
__label__Position	we shouldn't be worried about ai because it creates jobs regardless if a lot of people lose their jobs
__label__Position	A lot of people may lose their jobs due to AI
__label__Position	Weakening ethics and goodwill because of AI
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Support	Less restricted could mean allowing one comment per user or capping the amount of characters that can be used. I see this a fair
__label__Support	What about peoples right to freely express themselves on platforms
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Attack	It should not be made known to the public that certain comments have been deleted because it discourages participation. REMOVE THEM IN SECRET.
__label__Support	This will allow online users to think twice before spewing hate speech
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Attack	Unfortunately, newspapers are not always entirely neutral so perhaps they should sign up to some sort of independent moderation
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	you must run a bot system that will automatically detect and remove posts with mature language
__label__Support	I agree with this. They are quite good nowdays and can be used accurately to spot mature language
__label__Position	In my opinion, completely removing the ability to comment is a win for the people using hate speech. The problem should be tackled in another way. Machine learning/AI/bots are getting better and more accurate each year, so using one of those to pre-screen comments and in addition using human moderators to decide the not so clear cases is far more optimal choice in my opinion, as it wont reduce the freedom of speech and opinion, as it should be in democratic world.
__label__Position	Comment space encourages discussion of important topics and allows free exchange of information and so should not be eliminated. Independent moderators should be used in order to ensure that hate speech is quickly deleted and encourage users to express their ideas without using inappropriate or aggressive language.
__label__Support	Agreed
__label__Position	Comment sections are meant for social media platforms. The newspaper can post on a platform such as twitter in order to get comments - while disabling comments on their own platform.
__label__Position	Newspapers need to consider carefully how the comments affect readers' perception of an article - it may be preferable for the newspaper to remove the comment section unless they monitor the comments carefully: https://archives.cjr.org/behind_the_news/comments_color_news_perception.php
__label__Position	Should the comment space be removed, it should be evaluated how it will impact the newspapers and the readers. We can agree that what might be view as bad can also be viewed as good on the other perspective. Besides through conversations and other platforms hate speech is still used, trying to reduce it does not mean it will completely be used in the real world as well such as in the streets or TV.
__label__Position	People who are signed up to online newspaper websites need to be warned that hate speech or continual hate speech comments can result in them being banned permanently from the news websites. People from the newspaper websites need to hire someone, if they haven't, to monitor and control which comments should be eliminated.
__label__Position	Exactly and we can all learn from each other especially coming from different countries
__label__Position	Check this link: https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons that shows how widespread the problem of hate speech is, and how much hate speech online leads to violence in the real world. We ought to watch what we say on the internet because some people are gullible enough to put into action what people suggest should be done to mitigate certain subjective problems.
__label__Position	Without the comment section it would be hard to engage and interact with different kinds of people in different parts of the world. Its important to learn in all kinds of way. Free speech is a RIGHT.
__label__Position	Yes but according to this article, it shares the view that Newspapers should not be liable or held accountable for peoples views and opinions on comments, it not the views of the Newspaper https://thegatewayonline.ca/2016/01/newspaper-comment-sections-should-foster-free-speech/
__label__Position	Removing the comment section does violate free speech as not all comments contain hate speech and testing different measures of dealing with the comment section can be explored to see what works but removing the comment section altogether is a no.
__label__Position	Words and phrases that could be offensive should be banned from use in the comment section. Comments left on a post could be verified to be safe by a moderator before they are publicly visible to others.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Attack	True, but people take freedom of speech and it gives them the right to say whatever they want, without fear of persecution
__label__Support	But on the other hand, peoples opinions matter, it allows us to learn from each other when it is truly done right
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Attack	There already are websites for this and they're often echo chambers that create extremists that eventually shoot up malls.
__label__Support	In the book "Noise" it talks about taking the median for everyones view and making that the regulation. The conversation then becomes which views qualify as each end of this opinion spectrum? Surely not the hateful ones but a modicum of their views so they feel included instead of fuelling their distrust of systems not built for them.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Support	I agree to a certain extent - like Wikipedia, if anyone can contribute then there is no way to validate what's been said, and it can create "Fake News".
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	It would be helpful because it would discourage people from leaving unpleasant messages as they could be identified personally.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	By introducing a cyber bullying detecting software
__label__Attack	You'd have to get everyone to agree on a definition for cyber bullying before creating the software. Computers only know what you tell them, they aren't sentient beings capable of moral distinction. The human programming the software defines the meaning of hate speech, this really ties into the book "Noise" which discusses variables and the way it can drastically change outcomes based on the individual handling things. What is their life experience, have they experienced bullying, have they gotten therapy etc. If it's more than one person you have to collectively agree on shared experiences that culminate to the final definition of bullying.
__label__Support	This is interesting! I read an article about moderators with different policies on what constitutes hate speech and should be removed. There is an argument that some are too strict and moderate incivility, rather than just hate speech. Perhaps an AI version would have clearer guidelines programmed in? https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793
__label__Position	Completely doing away with the comment section would not be beneficial to the readers experience as reading other peoples thoughts is what sets online media apart from offline media. It plays a role in keeping the discussion going. It would be smart to rather monitor comments to ensure hate speech or utterances of a vile nature are greatly reduced through the use of some sort of algorithm that picks up on problematic words and deletes comments or it being done manually by people who will moderate the comment section.
__label__Attack	Regulations fail, and extremists will point to any minor failing as strong proof of their firmly held beliefs.
__label__Support	Absolutely, vague definitions are the downfall of effective communication. A lot like "Karen" replacing the actual words for situations like racist, entitled, rude, emotionally volatile, unreasonable etc. When we all hold a different definition for a word because it's been used too broadly it becomes harder to communicate. Clearly defining what hate speech is with links to the definitions in every format is what could help. People consume information more effectively in different modes like audio, visual, written etc.
__label__Position	If readers are not allowed to comment on what is on the media, then I don't see the need for the media to be even there in the first place if it is not for the people or the public. The better approach would be to rid the comment section of any sensitive or offensive words
__label__Position	I disagree with the stance of doing away with the comment section in its entirety, it goes against the premise of media which is to spark a debate or discussion.
__label__Attack	Media isn't about sparking debate it's about catching our attention, profiting off our attention and sharing their biased view with us. Some countries have tighter regulations for media than others as well, plus they write salacious headlines for sale knowing people won't always read the full text of the article. They cause the polarization in conversation.
__label__Support	I agree with you, i feel like thats what media is about, expressing ourselves.
__label__Position	by using an algorithm to detect certain words or phrases deemed as hate speech because algorithms are quite popular in social platform and have been proven to be effective and easy to source out information.
__label__Position	and also people should be made to understand that rights come with responsibility and should not use their rights to harm others
__label__Position	I think that readers who use hate speech should be reported and temporarily banned from the site, as I believe that we need comments section in online newspaper articles. It is important to share your views as we have freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	If we need other peoples opinions before we can form our own then we are literally just looking for confirmation bias of what we already believe
__label__Position	People who take part in hate speech should be dealt with lawfully so as its a form of cyber-bullying, that way less people will resort to hate speech
__label__Attack	We already struggle to prosecute rapists what makes you think cyber bullying takes priority?
__label__Position	I believe in democracy, equality and freedom of speech however I do not believe in hate speech therefore I believe that newspaper websites should keep the original essence of the newspaper and not a comment section as other newspaper websites with comment section seem to spread fake news. I think that since we live in a social media world, hence newspaper websites can post their article on them so that people can share their views on the article.
__label__Position	I think it would be helpful if we could create a trusted shared resource for quickly checking accuracy of information. Something like Snopes https://www.snopes.com/ for example that helps you quickly sort out whether the information is balanced. It doesn't fix the issue because there's always contention about "reliable sources" but it can help reduce some of that, perhaps news agencies can link them in the top of the comments section or include it as a quick link button when commenting so you can easily fact that comment itself without copy pasting.
__label__Attack	I think it is interesting to read the comments on a newspaper article, as the article is written from one perspective, while the comments show a much wider view. Even if I disagree with them, it is interesting and thought provoking to read the alternative view. Disabling comments reduces free speech and makes everything monitored and authorised - then you have to question who is controlling what we see?
__label__Position	I believe that comment sections should be moderated for comments that meet criteria for Hate Speech, while keeping as many comments as possible live. People must be allowed to express their opinions.
__label__Position	Disabling comments reduces free speech and makes everything monitored and authorised - then you have to question who is controlling what we see?
__label__Position	I agree with this, in that the public should have a say in the newspaper. However, I feel, that random members of the public could be unpredictable and could comment hateful things in the space.
__label__Position	To this, even though I agree with the right to free speech, and feel that it should be monitored for hate speech. This article below, shows the difference between the two. https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/hate-speech-is-not-free-speech-says-secretary-general-ahead-of-human-rights-day
__label__Position	Comments should be monitored and hate comments should be deleted immediately and those who engage in those activities regularly should be banned from using the platform
__label__Position	And also media contents should be cross checked and should publish truth only without hurting the parties involved personally.
__label__Support	The way to circumvent abuse of flagging is to create consequences for it. Being banned from the comments section in increments of time until someone is eventually permanently banned for too many infractions
__label__Support	AGreed
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Attack	I actually agree that eliminating the space for conversation on polarizing topics can reduce extremist echo chambers sometimes. Though they often move to other platforms that have zero regulations to hold that conversation when they can't have it where they saw something. Which increases the odds of being stuck in a hateful echo chamber.
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Doing nothing because of a fear that doing something will be ineffective, means simply that nothing will definitely be achieved. Freedom of speech is definitely curtailed if people who are likely to be attacked are themselves, afraid to speak. The experience of CreepyPMs in keeping their site open, friendly and inclusive, using 30 moderators for a relatively small site and a tough policy where in essence that comments must be conductive to a supportive environment and if not, can be removed, even if they have not violated a specific rule, seems to potentially curtail freedom of speech and could silence valid criticism but can also "allow marginalised and targeted individuals who are not likely to share their stories or opinions when the door is left open to the rest of the world" to speak. https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Attack	The dangers of allowing free speech has been constantly seen in different moments. A recent time was when Donald Trump Instigated riots in America, causing damage to buildings and applauding it... making it worse and worse
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Support	Absolutely, hate speech forms thoughts, which forms character which leads to violent actions with enough time. It's a very serious issue that causes real world harm to marginalized communities when left unchecked.
__label__Attack	I agree that hate speech should not be tolerated, but I don't think that it requires the total removal of space for comments, as the comments add value. I believe that moderation is the way forward.
__label__Attack	This article summarises it well
__label__Attack	This article summarises it well https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Support	I agree, everybody has freedom of speech and we all have to right to access t information.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Attack	Absolutely, if you are discussing the topic at hand - articles are meant to engage readers and grab their attention.
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Support	I totally agree, it will create more positive experiences to readers if it is removed.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	Best would be to use filters for keywords and have a functional helpdesk, team of mods,... If the mods ARE effective and the climate between the users is friendly, there is a high chance, that not many trolls/toxic comments will come up at a later time.
__label__Position	Having a 'pre-filter' of mods go through every single comment would be ineffective, since it wouldn't allow for a fresh and continuous discussion. Niether is it a good day to delete the comments altogether, since humans are social and need the interaction with others to develope. I am still for online filters and a competent team of mods, that can react to reported posts.
__label__Position	There could be a list of community guidelines that commenters would have to scroll through and check "I agree" or something similar before having access to the comment section. The community guidelines could include things like "No personal attacks" "No racial slurs or profanity" etc. It is important to remember that something is not automatically hate speech just because you are offended by it. Censoring all criticism and comments is not the answer, and neither is allowing a group of moderators to determine what is and what isn't hate speech. Community guidelines with clear outlines on what is and what isn't allowed is fair for all. Do not leave anything up to speculation.
__label__Position	Commenters with a history of hate speech should be blocked from commenting
__label__Position	For people cant help themselves but say meaning and hurtful words towards other commentator and towards the newspaper itself, laminating will be a great choice and idea.
__label__Position	I think removing the comment space will be of a disadvantage in terms of getting the engagement that the newspaper needs. Criticism doesn't always mean hate, however, filtering and censoring words will be the best option.
__label__Position	In all reality a troll and hate speech will always find its way into civil conversations and areas. The best would be to remove the ability from areas where sensitive people can avoid it.
__label__Position	Keep the comment space, and filter or censor explicit words.
__label__Position	AI technology could be used to override the possible bias that there might be if the moderators are human. It would follow an unbiased algorithm. https://www.smartmoderation.com/how-to-give-your-readers-the-comment-sections-they-want
__label__Position	although removing the comments section maybe an easy way to eliminate hate speech with will also prevent the readers from interacting and engaging in the posts
__label__Position	Removing the comment space is the easiest way to eliminate the hateful speeches from some of the readers
__label__Position	I think filtering hate speech comments can do that and allowing a better more positive and a welcome experience to all readers.
__label__Attack	Removing the comments limits speech, it goes against our freedom
__label__Support	Makes a more friendly and respectful environment
__label__Position	I think you could ban some words or have someone checking the comments and deleting the ones that are unappropiate, but limiting the whole comment section would be a mistake
__label__Support	I agree having an algorithm to delete specific words and phrases.
__label__Position	The opinion climate formed by news comments influences the opinions and comments of participants, providing evidence that those who hold strong opinions are more likely to comment when they perceive the opinion climate to be oppositional rather than supportive to their worldview. Creating an hostile environment. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563219303139
__label__Position	Removing the comments section can eliminate hate speech but also eliminates the ability for other readers to have a healthy discussion about the topic and add their own opinions and views. I think using a moderator or AI to moderate content could be a good way of eliminating hate speech. Or have a report button so that other readers can report such comments.
__label__Position	Even if we all do not agree with each other (it would be a boring place if we did!) I don't think it is right to completely removing commenting on newspaper websites and articles. But there are people out there who will use those areas as an excuse and a place to spout their horrible opinions and hate speech. When they do this then detracts from the original article as people will start to call the person out so it becomes all about them. There may also be people reading those views who could be influenced by them which is why they need to be removed as quickly as possible.
__label__Position	This article on civilrights.org discusses the fact that hate speech is pervasive and how we can all start to combat it. https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/combat-online-hate-speech/
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	By eliminating the entire comment secion you would be getting rid of the freedom of readers comments
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Attack	I disagree. I think other readers of hate speech could be influenced by it making the issue spread even further. You can share your opinions without using hate speech and with a balanced approach so it should be removed.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Support	Hate speech should not be tolerated and is a misuse of freedom of speech toward a goal that does not serve to benefit anyone
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Support	yes so that people can say their views
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Support	true, but maybe they can remove anonymity so that everyone can be accountable for what they say.
__label__Support	true, but maybe they can remove anonymity so that everyone can be accountable for what they say.
__label__Support	true, but maybe they can remove anonymity so that everyone can be accountable for what they say.
__label__Support	true, but maybe they can remove anonymity so that everyone can be accountable for what they say.
__label__Support	true, but maybe they can remove anonymity so that everyone can be accountable for what they say.
__label__Support	I agree with this comment. I really would encourage people to educate other people about the consequences and reasons behind hate speech. These factors might contribute to reduce it
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.

__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	Knowing the rules, unfortunately, doesn't mean that people respect them. There's a lot of hate speech on Facebook and a lot of it goes unnoticed.
__label__Position	Certain guidelines should be set and regulated to ensure they are being followed. Just as is done on plenty social media platforms. Any instances of prejudice or hate speech whether meant with no harm or ill intentions should be removed. Also an approval system can be set in place, so comments from readers can go through a filtration system before being posted.
__label__Position	Hate speech can be positive criticism and essential in some posts, altgough it can be offensive and totally uncalled for in other posts. A way in which social media apps regulate and monitor the comments, otherwise people have rights to freedom of speech.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking will violate human rights to freedom of speech and cause people to feel opressed, as that would mean that they can not voice out their opinions.
__label__Attack	We should avoid appearing like we are doing cancel culture
__label__Support	The comment space allows positive ideas to filter through
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not be implemented, people must learn to take some criticism in a positive way, it can be helpful.
__label__Support	that is actually true positive criticism
__label__Position	lts true hate speech should be taken as positive criticism
__label__Attack	apparently the target group does not consider it like that: https://journals.lww.com/psychosomaticmedicine/Abstract/2004/05000/Immigrant_Suicide_Rates_as_a_Function_of.9.aspx
__label__Position	While I fully appreciate the urgency of curtailing hate speech, I am strongly of the view that the space comment should not be eliminated because of a few bad apples. Rather an algorithm that can monitor and flag down hateful comments in real time could be used and thus positive and constructive contributions would continue to trickle in. Besides, merely shutting down the space comment results in cancel culture which is a step back in our dispensation.
__label__Position	This is not a black or white topic. The question is how exactly we define hate speech. Criticism in itself is not hate speech, but it is easy to take things to extremes, especially when someone expresses their opinion anonymously. Education about the reasons is important to better understand our own feelings and behaviour. Educate people do not restrict them!
__label__Position	“Addressing hate speech does not mean limiting or prohibiting freedom of speech. It means keeping hate speech from escalating into something more dangerous, particularly incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence, which is prohibited under international law.” — United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, May 2019 This is in line with my opinion related to this topic. Escalation is the real problem that could cause serious problems, such as hate crimes.
__label__Position	read though the comments and only put on the comments with the less hate speech on
__label__Support	Everyone is entitled to their opinions
__label__Position	I don't think hate speech should be allowed because it can cause more hate if readers agree so i think the comments should be monitored.
__label__Position	I think an AI that could identify some keyword related with hate speech would be helpful to flag that comment and allow further review
__label__Support	I think that would be good
__label__Attack	Free speech should be allow or we would be like communist countries
__label__Position	I think that comments should be monitored and certain keywords should be flagged for review. This wouldn't catch everything, but might help a little.
__label__Position	Reading the comments below, I do agree that people should be allowed to write their opinions online but I also agree that there is should be any kind of regulation that avoids hate speech. It has been discussed and shown over the years the impact of what is said on the internet in mental health. So I think it is time to be more restrict with alghoritms and detect certain keywords that are a red flag.
__label__Position	I agree that people should be allowed to comment (otherwise they'd just go and rant on social media), but there should be ways to flag, review and approve or delete hateful and disrespectful content.
__label__Position	I also would like to add that, as mentioned here, if there is no agreement in how to flag comments with hate speech, probably deleting the comment section would be better than leaving it. As can be shown on this article from The Guardian people in general associate the comment section as toxic https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation

__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.

__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments

__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Position	I think people should be able to express their feelings, but there should be a way to block hate speech
__label__Position	There can be some sort of system or AI that is able to scan comments for certain words associated with hate speech and if those words are identified, the comment is to be removed.
__label__Position	Those who are found to be using hate speech can be banned for a period of time from commenting on posts
__label__Position	By educating the masses on the psychological of hate speech on others
__label__Position	Against
__label__Position	I am still of the standing that some type of programme should be used to identify hate speech key words or phrases and remove comments that include them.
__label__Position	There should be a moderator monitoring the comment sections, removing the hateful and/or unnecessary comments.Another person should be in charge of double checking that the reasoning behind decisions made about deleting and keeping comments is valid. There should be a standard set for comments to be allowed to stay in the comment sections. Although the decision about whether or not the comments are hateful is susceptible to subjectivity, it's a better option than leaving hate speech on the website for all to view.

__label__Position	Perpetrators of hate speech must banned from the sites. This will deter and slow down would be perpetrators.
__label__Position	It's alarming that some people do not understand the dangers that are presented by accepthing hate speech.
__label__Position	Here are reasons why I agree with the position of having comments being moderated,it benefits everyone and prevents harmful or hateful speech.
__label__Position	I'm not seeing other positions so at this point I cannot provide a summary of my overall ideas.
__label__Position	Personally, I do not mind hate speech. It does not offend me. For the readers that are offended by it, they should have ways to eliminate it by maybe having the option to not see positions that contain certain words for them. Each reader should have the option to choose which words they regard as hate speech.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.

__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Attack	Because some peoples opinions can be hurtful to others
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Support	it would be nice if the comment could be made visible after it has been removed. others can know what to avoid and if it is NOT actually hate speech the conversation could be continued don't you think?
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	Education in media ethics: The first step in combating tribalized hate speech is realizing that, while the right to free expression is a fundamental human right, the rise of social media has produced a number of different channels for its creation, packaging, and transmission. The rights and liberties of journalists and their role in fostering and developing peaceful societies should be emphasized in media ethics education. The political, social, and cultural rights of individuals and groups, including the freedom of expression, must be made more widely known, as well as the obligations and societal repercussions that come with press freedom. Journalists need to have the knowledge and abilities to spot hate speech and disseminate anti-hate messaging.
__label__Position	I think there should a program that verify the comment before they are displayed on the newpaper
__label__Position	i do not agree with the method of doxxing people. hate speech has always existed, it is now on a more global scale because the world is more centralised as a result of social media. i believe the solution is censorship and moderation which sites like reddit and youtube already preactise.
__label__Support	strongly agree with andreas
__label__Position	We can reduce hate speech by having it moderated
__label__Position	End impunity for hate crimes: Newsroom monitoring and evaluation teams can help combat impunity for hate crimes. The goal of these groups would then be to track patterns in hate speech, compile reports, and alert important institutions and the civil society to them.
__label__Position	I think the best bet for reducing hate speech is by moderation. Either be it an actual person or AI. Completely removing comment sections seems like an infringement on freedom of speech.
__label__Position	It will because a person will be forced to say something positive or nothing at all
__label__Position	Moderation is the key to this argument, people like to talk and to share opinions, the newspapers readability might suffer if this is removed. there should be an algortithm censoring speech before it is posted and there should be an option to dispute if a statement is hate speech or not, which should then be reviewed by humans. Also it is very important to distinguish between hate speech and diferent opinions. Censorship should not equal an avenue to bully people.
__label__Position	Newspapers should have a clear indication of what they consider hate speech to be and what the consequences of posting hate speech on the platform are. Most sites require you to have an account in order to able to comment and you have to submit some personal information to create that account. The newspaper site should monitor comments and remove hate comments from the site and if you have been noted to be a serial hate commenter then your personal information used to create the account can be used to contact you for re-education purposes. This however, should come with a disclaimer so that people can know what they are getting themselve into.
__label__Position	I believe that if there was a program that could trace the people who are committing this crime and them getting punishment from the government law, it would reduce the hate speech. The problem is that people think they can get away. maybe this link can help: https://pmg.org.za/page/Prevention%20and%20Combating%20of%20Hate%20Crimes%20and%20Hate%20Speech%20Bill%20&%20International%20Crimes%20Bill:%20briefing,%20with%20Minister%20and%20Deputy%20Minister
__label__Position	Yes that could also help
__label__Position	We know from many studies that anonymity is a dangerous tool (https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-24373-001) that can cause people to agress in a way unusual to their regular behavior, what exacerbates this is when you see other people doing it also, it causes a sort of mob mentality (https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannecroteau/2019/02/01/our-society-is-broken-lets-fix-it/). So removing hate speech by using a flag system in tandem with moderatos wouldn't just help those who may be affected by it but also dissuade cruel people from commenting something unkind.
__label__Support	This article is interesting - perhaps a suggestion to use moderating language, or an agreement to respond politely and moderately, should be 'e-signed' by users before contributing.
__label__Position	All readers have the right to freedom of speech, which is protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. However, incitement of violence is not protected by The First Amendment. Since there are no laws regarding hate speech in the constitution - you cannot fairly censor or hide comments unless they are inciting violence.
__label__Position	Monitor comments made
__label__Position	Monitor comments (using technology)and block users that leave such comments
__label__Position	Use technology to monitor and block users
__label__Attack	Care must be taken not to accidentally block users
__label__Position	By a combination of monitoring and blocking people who leave such comments, and also having suitable laws in place to back this up
__label__Support	Having laws in place should ensure that hate speech is discouraged or punished
__label__Attack	Banning IP addresses could prevent users from a whole house or area being prevented from contributing
__label__Position	A combination of human moderation and automated actions should be applied. Free speech and the ability to comment is important to maintain the relationship between media and the reader (see Society of Editors Moderation Guide - https://www.societyofeditors.org/resources/). This needs to be balanced with contributing of human resources to combat hate speech using preventative and reactive measures,
__label__Position	Those who want to encourage and participate in reasoned debate should be given ways to be encouraged to do so themselves, and to contribute more. Social support can encourage people to participate in a more positive manner (https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-60830-006)
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Support	Such algorithms can be completely customized. For example: any posts containing a list of any key words can be prevented from posting.
__label__Support	it allows people to interact and share their opinion on the subject.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Support	they can monetize the paper
__label__Support	Because pretending as if it's not happening doesnt mean it will stop when there is a disable comment.
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Attack	I don’t think completely removing the comment space would solve the issue. A similar example would be Youtube removing the dislikes count on videos, it makes t he information less objective.
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	Education is k ey!
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Support	Its not fair, I believe its best to leave comment bar available to everyone because freedom of speech is still and thing and some who practice hate speech might be educated by another. Instead of leting one person practice hate speech elsewhere its best discussed and dealt with there and then. Something hate speech happenes dure to lack of knowledge.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	I agree with your opinion. I think trying to find ways to moderate the comments (either automatically or by a team of humans) would be a good step. Then it's also up to the responsability of the users themselves to have a good attitude.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	I agree that public comment sections should be moderated
__label__Position	It would be very difficult to achieve without removing the ability to comment (which, in my opinion , isn't t he best solution). That's the nature of internet anonymity.
__label__Position	The use of admins and moderators can be helpful in removing hate speech. They would need strict rules for the public in order to not let their own personal biases judge what is and isn't considered hate speech.
__label__Position	What about allowing the comment section, but having a built-in screener running in the background, that automatically prevents posts with certain hateful words it is built to detect?
__label__Attack	Good idea, however the elimination of hateful words won't completely eliminate hate speech altogether (ex. people can use alternate language)
__label__Position	having a screener in the background conrtolling everything thats coming in and also comment section
__label__Position	There can be a filtering system that filters hate speech
__label__Position	There is a strong need for newspapers to come up with strategies to manage this, as hate speech has been linked to increases in violence towards minorities, as seen here: https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons
__label__Position	you can make a screening in the background to control the context and also the comment section as everyone is allowed to their own opinion but not that aggresive in public
__label__Position	There is simply no place for hate speech in today's society. Even if you are not the intended victim, there are ways you can take a stand against it. The following article provides some helpful tips: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/take-action/engage
__label__Position	Reducing it requires everyone is the comment section to be willing to educate people who feel expresssing hate speech is a freedom of speech. Working together as the world and the newspaper to elaborate if the confusion is beyond. Somethimes it happens because people dont understand whats actually happening.
__label__Position	How about removing the anonymity part of it like everyone who wants to comment must be a verified member.
__label__Position	I agree that challenging hate speech is important and can see how the arguments for non-moderated but automated filtering systems discussed earlier might seem to make sense, on the surface but, if anything, the failure of these systems across the web to filter out hate speech is the reason human moderation is necessary fro any comments section, especially for a newspaper, where people often pay more attention to the comments than the contents.
__label__Support	I agree with you. I am a member of some public facebook groups for various things and they all have volunteer moderators who immediately remove harmful content. This is definitely feasible, especially if they are paid positions.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Attack	Yes, you can have your own opinion but that doesnt mean you have the right to spread hate.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?

__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	I do not agree with this, to solve this issue, there should be moderators to monitor the comments before they are posted
__label__Position	Maybe filter through comments
__label__Support	There are just so many options.
__label__Position	promote good stories about people doing good and helping society
__label__Position	I don't believe removing the comment section will help remove hate speech, but having a system that can track the device and the people that use that device can go a long way in removing trolls from a community platform and prevent them from becoming repeat offenders.
__label__Position	you wanna control people thoughts???
__label__Position	hate speech is still free speech tho
__label__Position	Maybe we shouldn't. If filtering changes people's honest opinions then it isn't a good thing. Moderating leaves it open to deleting what someone simply doesn't agree with.
__label__Attack	les modérateurs ont un rôle important à jouer mais, en fonction du flux de commentaires, il peut-être difficile à mettre en œuvre.
__label__Position	Maybe online newspapers can invest in text mining, where if hate speech is detected, the comment will not go through. Or, in the comments section, there could be a greyed message in the background that states a non-tolerance to hate speech.
__label__Position	I agree: https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/03/29/the-future-of-free-speech-trolls-anonymity-and-fake-news-online/
__label__Position	There's no easy solution, too much censorship and it gives the trolls a reason to complain, not enough and it allows hate speech to thrive.
__label__Position	Filters absolutely are needed in comments once again, and I agree that newspapers are needed to inform people
__label__Position	Newspaper websites are sometimes unnecessary https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1464884911415974?casa_token=RM42P4G5U60AAAAA:n6-vECv4AX2ILnJATk-2H_IyptM37ftGMKhNFh7pdCqtoNvJBWv9PvhvO1FuvRls-A2koV4QHA

__label__Attack	In my country, and I have no doubt in many others, incitement to hatred is punishable by law. So, when you write that it is not the problem of newspapers or websites, I can only be astonished. It is too easy to start a controversy that may have consequences and to defend it by saying: "we have started a discussion, the outcome is not our responsibility, we wash our hands of it".
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Support	I agree that removing the comments section is not a solution to stopping hate speech as this just encourages users to go to different platforms, users need to be able to post their opinions but newspapers should have a responsibility to monitor what is being posted as well as a responsibility on the tone of articles they post online as this can have an effect on the type of comments that users leave as some users will see an article and the tone of the article will make them respond in a controversial way which encourages hate speech.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Attack	I disagree people need to show what they think about what has been written
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	Just don't write about it
__label__Position	the opinion should be checked before publishing
__label__Position	Should be reviewed first before it gets published
__label__Position	pro
__label__Position	I agree that it all should be reviewed before it is published
__label__Attack	Agree and come to an agrrement of which part should be removed, or find a better way of writing it which does not have any hate speech in it
__label__Position	ban people who post hate speech
__label__Position	No one should be able to post hate speech comments or remarks. There must be moderations in place that regulate such comments and conduct.
__label__Position	After reviewing there should be a common ground as to whihc part results in hate speech so that it gets deleted or change the writing
__label__Position	I personnally think hate speech shouldnt even be discussed being a fact of the topic or not. Reason being every has easy access on newspapers you wouldnt want teenagers to be reading hate speech o newspapapers.
__label__Position	I think without the comments you will not be able to react to what you have read and have your say
__label__Position	Some people can just delete someone's comment not necessarily it is a hate speech, but because they do not like the person.
__label__Position	i believe it is neccessary to name and shame users to use hate speech but unfortunately some will tend to use fake names and profiles
__label__Position	another way to curb hatespeech is using empathy, as using humour can "fuel the flame"- https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2021/12/empathy-based-counter-speech-can-reduce-hate-speech.html
__label__Position	it is the newspapers responsibility to filter out hate speech and flag the users doing so, removing the comment section does infringe the right to free-speech.
__label__Position	Where children are involved, I think it is necessary to filter out hate speech. Dark comments or 'trolls' can be uneducated, and have opinions that are harmful to the developing brain, or just flat-out 'fake news'.
__label__Position	I do not believe it is necessary to name and shame users of hate speech, as although their actions are wrong, this may lead to humiliation and darker thoughts, self harm or suicide. Repying to the comment with empathy and education may be the best guide, and if the action does not change, possibly a block.
__label__Position	Whilst free speech should be allowed, social media companies have a responsibility to remove hate speech and to stop hate speech from being posted online, this can be via AI tools and algorithms that are designed to pickup on information posted that falls under the category of hate speech. Posts should be pre-checked first to confirm that they they don't fall under the banner of hate speech whilst still allowing users to express their opinions on a wide variety of topics. Also the newspapers have a duty not to inflame the situation further with their website articles as this is more likely to elicit a response from users that could be considered hate speech as users are more likely to respond to controversial articles and this could be seen as encouraging users to post hate speech.
__label__Position	A good starting point would be to ensure comments aren't anonymous, so that people think more carefully about what they write.
__label__Position	Exactly - there are plenty of other online spaces where people can comment on articles - no need for them to also be able to comment directly under the articles themselves.
__label__Position	One approach is that followed by The Guardian where comments are switched off for articles about topics which tend to generate a lot of hate speech https://www.joe.ie/news/the-guardian-website-will-no-longer-allow-comments-under-articles-about-race-immigration-and-islam-528924
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Attack	The idea of using AI algorithms to combat hate speech is an attractive one. However, using experience of Facebook, it's clear that AI systems are still not advanced enough to undertake this task without human oversight. Facebook often censors posts or comments unfairly because its AI algorithms doesn't understand the context. In short, I don't believe we can get away without using humans to check the flagged comments at least.
__label__Attack	AI algorithms are frequently biased. There's still a long way to go before reliable AI algorithms are developed. Until then, using AI algorithms alone to moderate the comment sections of newspapers will likely lead to harmless comments removed, and, on the other hand, harmful comments published. https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/02/04/the-role-of-bias-in-artificial-intelligence/?sh=3bf5308b579d
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Support	Yes it is not a solution because people will no longer discuss the contents of the article, we should keep the comment section open
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy

__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Support	I agree. Some for of moderation is needed. Users should have to agree to some sort of "anti hate speech" policy when signing up and accounts who violate the policy (by posting hate speech) should be banned. The moderation can be done similarly to how social media platforms such as Instagram allows users to filter out certain keywords from their comment section and any comments with those words do not appear in the comment section as seen here ( https://help.instagram.com/700284123459336 )
__label__Position	Comments should be screened, comments that are not insightful should be removed individuals promoting hate speech should be banned
__label__Position	The only way to reduce hate speech is to create an algorithm that will delete any comments that displays hate speech
__label__Position	In addition to the moderation, checks can be used (for example filtering software) to filter out common slurs/ derogatory words in order to make sure comments with such words are not posted to the comment section
__label__Support	Yes there should be
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	There absolutely are ways to facilitate healthy conversation and debates without allowing hate speech. Both algorithms and human moderation are ways to ensure debate can continue without resorting to abuse.
__label__Position	Have some moderation but allow a platform for healthy discussions to take place
__label__Position	I don't believe eliminating space for readers comments is a fair practice. People should be free to express their opinion. Hate speech can be a problem. However, simply turning off comments is not going to eliminate hatred; it will only sweep the problem under the carpet. In fact, allowing people to vent in the comment sections can serve as an escape valve for the negative emotions.
__label__Position	I'm totally against hate speech but I do believe in freedom of speech so therefore I believe the way forward is to have moderators regularly reviewing the comment section.
__label__Position	I think it would be a good idea to have someone or people depending how active the site is, monitoring the websites and all posted comments should be checked before being posted.
__label__Position	Make it so people can only answer in relation to the article and not comment on other people's comments
__label__Position	I think it would be a very good idea to have moderators on heavily commented on articles. Again I think it would help if comments were restricted to the article and people are not allowed to comment on what other people have said
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	If the newspapers are providing a platform on which abuse can be given, they do have a responsibility to prevent it. Abuse is in no way shape or form valid criticism.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Position	Hate speech does more harm than good
__label__Support	yes it's true several articles show the effects that harassment on social networks can have on mental health
__label__Support	https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/study-social-media-use-linked-to-decline-mental-health
__label__Position	People who choose to comment on newspapers articles are usually not a representative sample of the general population. Depending on which platform you are on, the views and opinions might be skewed. However, that can open the doors to interesting discussions. Moderating comments is a better approach when trying to get rid of hate speech
__label__Position	there is nothing to be fair about, hate speech must be eradicated totally from the online publication.
__label__Position	I think hate speech must be taken out.
__label__Position	It already happens on platforms like YouTube and Instagram so it's definitely possible for article sites.
__label__Position	True
__label__Position	We should all have the option to voice our opinion. If doing so can result in hate speech, then we have to find a way to fight it instead of trying to eliminate comments altogether. Flagging certain words or using algorithms could potentially could help hide comments that don't add any value and are just trying to cause harm
__label__Support	Totally agree. It still gives space to express but will limit the hate speech
__label__Support	This statement was inspired and taken from Secretary General (https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/hate-speech-is-not-free-speech-says-secretary-general-ahead-of-human-rights-day)
__label__Support	Banning hate speech will radicalize people who will only feel more oppressed by the opposition trying to silence them.
__label__Position	This statement was inspired and taken from Secretary General (https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/hate-speech-is-not-free-speech-says-secretary-general-ahead-of-human-rights-day) I am a firm believer that we are all entitled to freedom of speech. I am also a believer that nobody should feel threatened after sharing a written piece in a newspaper. The easy access to comment sections is drawing out the wrong type of people who post extreme forms of hate. I do not believe that this is the correct exercise of free speech. There are many ways we can share opinions, but attacking people online is not the way. Hate comments should be banned
__label__Position	hate speech should be regulated as it can be harmful to others. See the following article to back this up. Theil, S. (2019). “The Online Harms White Paper: comparing the UK and German approaches to regulation” Journal of Media Law 1.
__label__Position	Hate speech leads to violence and I really think it should be eradicated https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons
__label__Position	“Addressing hate speech does not mean limiting or prohibiting freedom of speech. It means keeping hate speech from escalating into something more dangerous, particularly incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence, which is prohibited under international law.” — United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, May 2019 https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech
__label__Position	Most comments that understood the question seem to agree that filtering comments with hate speech helps reduce hate speech as well as allowing readers to report inappropiate comments which are then reviewed and deleted. One, I didn't know is regulations within countries that require companies to remove hate speech like in Germany, this will be useful in that companies will take the law seriously to avoid fines and penalties.
__label__Position	There should be a system of other contributors being able to flag potential hare speech and a way to vote on whether the comment was hate speech, enabling a balanced consensus to be achieved.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	As technology becomes more advanced, there are algorithms that detect hate speech, for example on Twitter. People can also report hateful comments so that only appropiate comments are left.
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	I feel they do have a responsibility to monitor trolling and abusive behaviour as this can be harmful to others. A modern legal test of the legitimacy of proposed restrictions on freedom of speech was stated in the opinion by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. in Schenk v. U.S. (1919): a restriction is legitimate only if the speech in question poses a “clear and present danger”—i.e., a risk or threat to safety or to other public interests that is serious and imminent.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Support	Algorithms and AI are much more advanced than the common person thinks. AI is able to discern intent. It is not solely based on keywords like a primitive AI from 30 years ago.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	It's quite easy to use freedom of speech as an excuse when people comment on certain topics, so there should be some kind of restrictions on how people get to express their opinions.
__label__Position	I think it should be possible to filter out certain triggerwords with AI-Programs. Sure it is not the most optimal soltion. But perhaps more convinient for the first moments in a heated conversation.
__label__Position	I believe the comment section should not be closed but however, people should voice out their views whilst being respectful. There is no reason to be mean and hit below the belt. Obviously we cant all have the same views but if we communicate well, we might learn more from our differences
__label__Position	https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3394231.3397902
__label__Support	This article suggests that more hateful comments are posted when the article/content is about real world divisive events
__label__Position	I agree with your ideas. I think it still gives people a voice but without going too far
__label__Support	Flagging comments would be good
__label__Support	That is actually a good idea, but gives a lot of power to the moderators.
__label__Attack	Not to be rude, but I doubt people who post hateful comments would care. Imagine someone telling a bully that they're rude - I don't think this would change anything in their behaviour.
__label__Position	i agree free speech is im portant however it needs to be monitored carefully. free speech can very quickly turn into hate speech leading to crime and violence. much research has been done to show how serious hate speech can be and how much it leads on to other things
__label__Position	https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-and-real-harm
__label__Support	"hate speech has been identified as a common precursor to atrocity crimes, including genocide"
__label__Position	I think with the modern technology it's possible to find a common ground between not allowing any comment spaces and wild-west commentary. Hate Speech and the upholding of free speech is an shakey equilibrium. Certainly, the news outlets are in a special position in this case.
__label__Position	I am not sure if we can fairly reduce hate speech. People can be mean and will find ways to spew their venom on others
__label__Position	Computers should be able to detect hate speech if there is any and report and remove that comment whinin minutes of posting it
__label__Support	This is at a low cost to the newspaper and should work quite effectively to remove the hate speech.
__label__Position	By using moderators or AI to police the posts
__label__Attack	I think using AI would not prove to be very effective. If this AI was to be self-supervised (without any moderators) I think it would quickly start flagging not-hateful comments as hate speech since it's very susceptible to user input - see what happened to Microsoft's Twitter bot Tay. After a couple of weeks, if I'm not mistaken, the AI started posting very hateful tweets about the holocaust and minorities.
__label__Position	Advanced AI is the ultimate answer. It is the cheapest and most unbiased moderator option.
__label__Attack	https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/04/1025742/ai-hate-speech-moderation/ It is (at least for the moment) not really possible for an AI to filter out hate speech efficiently. https://hai.stanford.edu/news/why-ai-struggles-recognize-toxic-speech-social-media

__label__Attack	I personaly like the General Policy Recommendation from the Council of Europe to this topic: https://www.coe.int/en/web/european-commission-against-racism-and-intolerance/recommendation-no.15
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Attack	As much as I would *like to* agree, I unfortunately cannot. Free speech still IS a part of free speech. I'm afraid you can't have one or the other - they are co-dependent as I believe, humans are inherently seeking conflict.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Attack	I absolutely agree with that position. As much as I hope and believe people should not resort to hate speech, but rather have a civilized conversation and respect each other's opinions, I am aware people might simply not be capable of that. Also - hate speech is not illegal in most countries. Quote from Wikipedia: "While "hate speech" is not a legal term in the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that most of what would qualify as hate speech in other western countries is legally protected free speech under the First Amendment." Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_in_the_United_States
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Attack	I believe ALL websites with ANY content are responsible for the messages their content conveys - be it articles, podcasts, videos or comments.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Attack	This is true but with the way the news is setup, giving your own idea can lead to heated arguments which can lead to hate speech
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed

__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	The comment section should not have been removed but filter to remove anything that involves hate speech or entices violence, as this limitation revokes people of their freedom of speech
__label__Position	The reader comments space should not be eliminated as it prevents the concept of freedom of speech, however there should be a regulations or filters to remove such comments that may be harmful to other or include hate speech.
__label__Position	the comment section should be set in a way that filters certain words that promote hate speech
__label__Attack	I think this is a good idea, but people have a way of getting around these filters by using different fonts or characters that cannot be read by the filter bots.
__label__Position	allow people to say what they feel
__label__Position	by checking what people comment befor approval
__label__Support	This would be a good idea in theory, but there is not enough man-power to do this. Who would fund these moderators?
__label__Position	I believe that comment sections should remain open, but should be monitored and flagged for key words or harmful messages. Having a space to respectfully critique or share add on ideas allows readers to continue to think critically about the article at hand and form educated opinions considering both sides or an argument.
__label__Position	before people can comment, they should be required to complete a short survey that can detect their opinions on the issue, then the results would be used to whether allow the person to comment or not
__label__Position	By educating people about the harm caused by hate speech that results in people committing suicide
__label__Position	i believe commenting should have it's policy, where users have to read the policy before commenting. So if a user uses language that promotes hate speech, the comment should be removed.
__label__Position	Readers should be allowed to comment on topics that are available to everyone. We should not reduce freedom of speech we shold develop softwares that are able to detect when hate speech has been written then said comment should be deleted
__label__Position	Yes I agree with this!
__label__Position	This makes it hard fr the reader to connect to said topic as they cant express their views
__label__Support	true
__label__Position	The readers have the right of speech but as newspaper they can filter out words which protect the credibility of the paper
__label__Position	Once again, I think this comes down to thorough monitoring and censoring of specific words. Additionally, having an option to report a comment would be beneficial so that attention is drawn to that comment and can be reviewed by a third party to see if it is appropriate. Perhaps if there were many issues and after a period of time it was being found that more harm than good was being shared in these sections, that they may have to be removed.
__label__Position	The newspaper websites should allow only positive comments, if the comments are negative they shouldnt be apploaded
__label__Position	i think writers should also be careful of how they write their articles because sometimes their angles are the ones encouraging hate speech
__label__Position	Report those who comment using hateseech and ban them from said platform
__label__Position	Those commenting with negative comment should be blocked so that they cant be able to access the website again
__label__Position	Educate people that hate speech can lower a person's self esteem
__label__Position	Have filtering algorithms on the newspaper website to filter out comments that could be viewed as hate speech.
__label__Position	Educate people that people are loosing hope when they need help and some people are busy commenting with hate speech
__label__Position	People commenting with hate speech should be fined
__label__Position	Educate youth about the concequences of hate speech
__label__Position	When you are found commenting with hate speech you should be arrested
__label__Position	Comments posted by readers must be filtered
__label__Position	The newspaper should vet newspaper reader and make sure their platform is not dominated by racist
__label__Position	There should be fines introduced for hateful speech.
__label__Position	Once you are found commenting with hate speech, you should apologize
__label__Attack	But will that be effective?
__label__Position	Only People from certain age should be allowed to comment
__label__Support	hate speech will be reduced
__label__Position	In terms of readers posting a comment on a newspaper website, they should be informed on what the newspaper website sees as hate speech. Things will be clear from there
__label__Position	Online comment sections provide a space for the public to interact with news, to express their opinions, and to learn about others’ views. https://mediaengagement.org/research/survey-of-commenters-and-comment-readers/
__label__Position	The options users have, the rules commenters are obliged to follow, and the moderation regime they confront, could influence the quantity and quality of comments. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17512786.2014.899758?cookieSet=1
__label__Position	This should be done with a mix of moderation, community flagging and reporting before moving to disabling comments, based ona mix of moderative judgement and amount of flagging
__label__Support	it allows disagreement while preventing abuse
__label__Attack	Its open to gaming, ie getting stories taken down
__label__Position	The way to avoid constant closure of the comments section is to use well-considered, human judgement by moderators back by explicit codes of conduct with examples. Some evidence of this approach:
__label__Position	The evidence below gives you an indication that informaed moderation does work, especially were that to be combined withexplicit rules and things like a warning system.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	but it discredit the news paper

__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.

__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	I think this is a good solution for the problem. People will always find a way around it but it will eliminate at least some hateful comments.
__label__Position	That would take away free speech, however I think they need to add some sort of AI that can immediately pick up any forms of hate speech and immediately delete or even block it
__label__Support	That would reduce hate speech
__label__Position	Have slurs programmed in as keywords so that comments which feature them are not published.
__label__Position	Hate speech has no place in online debate. However, suggestions to use moderators to police forums are heavily flawed, as such processes will be open to personal bias. Who decides what constitutes hate speech? The notion of 'rewiring' perspectives, and 'tracking down' posters seems very authoritarian and not in keeping with a free and democractic society. However, people being unable to post from anonymous accounts would probably be beneficial.
__label__Position	The algorithm should have code that detects certain hate speech words and shadow bans them so as they do not appear on the site. with a warning that it will happen if the post is posted.
__label__Position	The best way to curb hate speech would be to have the comments section moderated for any forms of hate speech. In this manner people who have an opinion with substance can have a say in whatever article that was published.
__label__Attack	In an ideal world perhaps, but how would you recognise 'hate speech' and police this in practical terms without infringing civil liberties and free speech. AI offers one avenue, but many challenges remain and there are many risks with this approach: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0221152
__label__Support	I agree, there should be a policy on what is considered hate speech therefore making easy to censor hate speech
__label__Position	A key issue with many of the suggestions if how you would identify, define and police hate speech. Many suggest online moderators, but these are open to personal bias. Others suggest AI, but this has its own challenges and risks.
__label__Position	There should be some level of censoring applied
__label__Position	Numerous positions have already been provided and the following represents my summary/reconcilliation of said positions: IF the objective is to *reduce* hate speech without eliminating the opportunity for readers to comment, we must be careful and consider our options with forethought. Others have mentioned before that the authomatic censorship on the basis of keywords is a convenient, one-time-implementation approach to reducing hate speech. On this, I agree. Certain words (unambiguously profane or mired in hatred) should trigger the system to not post a comment (and further, shadowban a given user for some determined amount of time [or post attempts]). Software is not a substitute for human judgement, though, and there are always ways for people to circumvent software-based enforcement (e.g., simply writing profanity with punctuation between letters so as to still convey the same hateful message). Thus, *some* degree of human intervention is necessary. Having said that, the use of human moderators is also prone to certain flaws (someone mentioned personal bias; I mentioned emotional labour, burnout, and high turnover on the part of the moderators). One option that has some historic precedent is to crowdsource the task of regulating content (e.g., as in the case of Reddit, wherein the audience has the ability to "upvote" or "downvote" individuals' responses. This is not without its flaw as it may quickly spiral into a hivemind type situation (furthermore, ad populum is indeed a logical fallacy). We are also reminded that "letting the free market decide what happens" is a dangerous game. What I'd advise, therefore, is at least a tri-partite solution: The use of software to automatically screen and filter out the most heinous of comments that happen to include inexcusable hate-words, a public that has the power to upvote/downvote, and a moderation team that has the authority to overide the former two (in case a perfectly legitimate but unpopular post is racking up downvotes simply for going against the status quo despite not necessarily being hateful in intention). A TEAM of moderators will reduce the probability that any one single person's bias is unduly influencing a given decision. This is NOT a perfect solution, but I think it attempts to incorporate the goodness of many other solutions previously mentioned.
__label__Position	Having read through the opinions of others, my stance has not completely changed. It is important to censor comments, freedom of speech does not always equate to disrespecting the views and opinions of others. While I agree that comments should be censored, I do not agree that every comment should be removed. As mentioned before, a system can be implemented that removes comments with certain words, thus making the comment section a safe space for all who use it.

__label__Position	I have read through some of the cooments and my stance is still the same. It is no doubt that hate speech is a problem, however, not allowing the public the opportunity to comment on issues may not only be a problem against freedom of speech, it may also cause the newspaper to lose some of its loyal readers if they're not able to engage with the content shared by the newspaper.
__label__Position	I believe that freedom of speech is every human being's right, if it infringes on the human rights of another person then hate speech should be moderated. That being said it now begs the question as what is considered hate speech and the people who moderate the comments consider hate speech as.https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793?cookieSet=1stated in
__label__Position	I strongly feel that comments are an essential part of the readers experience. It assists readers by giving them a broader sense and understanding of the topic being discussed. Removing them would be taking a way an integral part of that experience.
__label__Attack	Have you actually read the comments on a newspaper article!
__label__Position	https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/073953299701800301?journalCode=nrja
__label__Position	This article tagged below explains the cons of hate speech on articles. https://ethics.journalists.org/topics/hate-speech-and-actions/
__label__Position	I do not see the value in the users comments and rarely read them. People often seem to post unverified rubbish presented as fact. I compare to a printed newspaper, where the only right to reply is by means of letters to the editor.
__label__Position	This United Nations Guide has a clear reference to what constitutes hate speech. I think it is important to remember that it is only hate speech when directed against individuals or groups of individuals. https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	True but having set standards could help reduce it effectively because freedom of speech also comes with responsibility.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Attack	Speech cannot be violence in and of itself. What you are suggesting closes down public forums and debate, enhancing the impact of closed minded thinking and echo chambers in our society.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Attack	I disagree, as newspaper websites should be held accountable (in some form) for the public engagement of their content. This should be done to mitigate the risks of cyberbullying https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/cyberbullying
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Attack	I don't agree. This would infringe on free speech. Rather have guidelines and censor any comments that promote hate speech.
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Support	This allows for people to understand that something will be done if they conduct hate speech.
__label__Attack	everyone should be entitled to free speech
__label__Support	Good way to educate society.
__label__Support	I agree with this because as much as one has freedom of speech, be mindful of others and do not be disrespectful
__label__Attack	People may feel as if they are being silenced.
__label__Support	This is more than just censoring
__label__Attack	Privacy concern.
__label__Support	Beneficial to the masses.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Support	Will allow for more focus on what really matters.
__label__Attack	But public opinion would be silenced, which is bad for democracy.
__label__Position	Go through and censor out certain words
__label__Support	Not so much swearing and negativity.
__label__Position	Censor out certain worsd
__label__Attack	I guess this works. However, people tend to find other ways to spread hate
__label__Position	anati
__label__Position	anati
__label__Position	Hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by educating people about the consequences of hate speech and what they can do to someone else.
__label__Support	The comment section should be a safe where everyone is free to place their opinion and ask question without someone making them feel somehow about themselves.
__label__Attack	some people wont like being told what they can and cannot say
__label__Position	Ensuring there is a process of discipline involved for anyone participating in hate speech. Measures such as warnings or account determination may be taken.
__label__Position	It can be reduced by warning people of the actions which will be taken by the newspaper article if they come across hate speech comments.
__label__Position	I don't think it's fair to eliminate comments from newspaper articles because the public is entitled to have their opinions heard. The best way to deal with hate speech is to moderate each comment before it is posted. Also the newspaper could ban accounts who engage in hate speech in the comments section. This moderation could be done through both human moderators and software to find trigger words signifying hate speech. It's important to democracy that citizens can have their say on the issues that affect their lives.
__label__Support	True. At the end of the day, the publisher controls what is published
__label__Position	The comment section can be monitored and any comments that have hate speech should be censored.
__label__Position	The technical team of the newspaper should select comments that don't promote hate speech and make those comments the only ones that are going to appear on the newspaper's websites.
__label__Support	I agree with this statement, however, we all know that users will just sign in under another ID. But agree in principal.
__label__Support	I believe it is fair for hate speech comments to be censored, because it could lead to violent public behavior. (read this: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech)
__label__Position	We need to hire moderators to check through forums and censor what needs to be censored. People should not be allowed to make hateful or negative comments.
__label__Position	I believe it is fair for hate speech comments to be censored, because it could lead to violent public behavior. (read this: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech)
__label__Position	I believe it is fair for hate speech comments to be censored, because it could lead to violent public behavior.
__label__Position	Good point. If people had to register their real identity, they would be less inclined to engage in hate speech.
__label__Position	There are many ways newspapers could use to eliminate hate speech from their comment sections. Methods such as software to identify keywords, moderators, having to register to comment, a report button, blocking users who post hate speech, and a clear set of rules displayed before posting. Using these systems should eliminate hate speech from comment sections while still allowing the public to have their say.
__label__Position	Newspaper websites may provide reasons of the consequences of hate speech comments.
__label__Position	I think that is very difficult to control. Maybe you would need a team of moderators constantly monitoring alongside bots to catch hate speech. Hate speech is unacceptable and should be addressed, however difficult to manage.
__label__Position	Using moderators, educating users, calling out trolls and haters!
__label__Position	I think rather than removing the option to comment/debate below an article, there could be moderators and hate speech buttons and bots to keep hate speech at bay.
__label__Position	everyone should be entitled to comment and have opinions but the comment section should be checked and hate comments deleted and that user blocked on the website
__label__Attack	How is this going to stop trolls that create multiple accounts so that if they are blocked they just do it from another faceless account consequences.l
__label__Position	There should be a system in place that flags negative words associated with hate speech and doesn't allow the comment to be posted and puts the person and comment under review.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Attack	Free speech is very important, but newspapers also has a responsibilty to ensure hate speech is not spread through their comment section.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information.

__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Support	I agree completely. I argue that it is not up to the newspaper websites to police such discussion and that comments only harm the neutral perspective that they offer. There are plenty of other discussion platforms #like Reddit, Facebook, or Twitter, where such discussions could take place and where other users have the power to moderate the community opinion themselves.
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Support	Totally agree
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Attack	I don't think banning people from commenting would lead them to do something more powerful or extreme.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Support	free speech is maintained
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Position	I think by blocking certain terms that are hateful when responding to others in comments i.e., you are an idiot, loser etc. Hate speech should not be present online.
__label__Attack	blocking certain words could automatically delete comments that are not necessarily hateful to another person
__label__Support	it is a great idea
__label__Position	By blocking the accounts of people that use hateful speech and not allowing them to access all newspapers websites
__label__Position	block the person who always use hate speech
__label__Position	I think that by removing anonymous commenting, you may stop a lot of people commenting at all which is bad for free speech. Not everyone who wants to remain private will use hate speech. Definitely more moderation would be a good idea though.
__label__Position	By having a system that detects bad or hate speech comments
__label__Position	Allow users to report comments.
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	I think everyone raised some good points already, but overall, it seems to be that some moderation is required no matter what, and that might be too costly for some smaller platforms to implement.
__label__Position	Allow others users to rate the comments and block those who receive bad ratings
__label__Support	right
__label__Position	I think there must be a system that will detect hateful comments and block them.
__label__Attack	I'm not very sure that an automated system is the answer. There are many cases of false positives, particularly when other users attempt to have a discussion with the offender. The machine picks up on keywords used commonly in hate speech and the users attempting a discussion may use these keywords as well.
__label__Support	If they are allowed to make their comments through other channels of communication then I agree.
__label__Position	1st argument: allowing hate speech to fester online is detrimental and can be hurtful to others. It can have horrific consequences. By moderating and removing hate speech comments, this should prevent any negative consequences from occurring.
__label__Position	There are other ways to reduce or block hateful comments without having to eliminate comment section.
__label__Position	We need to block the users that use hate speech and filter the comments that have any form of hate speech.
__label__Support	Trolling is human nature, it will never stop so measures need to be placed because this problem will never change unless people change. https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/03/29/the-future-of-free-speech-trolls-anonymity-and-fake-news-online/
__label__Support	agree
__label__Attack	But then no-one can give useful positive advice
__label__Position	Having bots to look for hate speech
__label__Position	Removal of comments entirely is akin to removal of freedom of speech and should be avoided.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	eliminating space for readers comments wouldn't be a good idea on my own opinion there's people who genuinely wants to give good comments and there wouldn't be space for them to.
__label__Support	agree
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.

__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Support	hate sppech exists wheather in a comments section or not
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Support	I agree with this as it is important to allow freedom of speech, however, not to the detriment of others. There need to be acceptable guidelines.
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.

Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Attack	certain words that are flagged as hate speech should be removed
__label__Attack	Privacy issues. I know that my information are already somehow online but no one would be willing to give them freely, with the risk of being persecuted.
__label__Attack	Freedom of speech is important, if we remove comments we remove other perspectives. Not all comments are hate speech
__label__Position	Provide guidance on what is and isnt hate speech would work i think
__label__Support	I agree, I think some people are unaware of what can be considered hate speech
__label__Support	i ddoubt this would work too well
__label__Support	HATE SPEECH is speech that is vulgar and intended to offend.
__label__Attack	Any expression that freely and openly gives a clear point that will not offend or insult anyone is not hate speech
__label__Position	i think minimum news coverage should be given to hate speech and it shouuld be very stictley monitered as well
__label__Support	Agree, it is essential to monitor hate
__label__Position	Provide a clear definition on what is considered hate speech and eliminate those comments that fit in that definition
__label__Attack	I dont agree with this, if hate speech is causing societal issues it should be talk about in the news
__label__Support	I agree, people need to review comments
__label__Attack	it would make sure that very offensive comments could be either moderated or removed
__label__Position	I think that eliminating the comments section altogether might be a useful idea as even moderators might not be effective in controlling the hate speech in comments section.
__label__Attack	That is a very minimalistic view as there could be many words that get missed and what happens if someone uses normal words that make a hateful sentence
__label__Position	modrate what can be posted before it allowed to be published finally
__label__Support	Yes, and also also others to report. If many report, the moderators will take a closer look.
__label__Position	There is a fine line between freedom of speech and hate. And hate can be interpreted differently for different people causing biased censorship. Therefore newspapers should have moderators from both sides of opinion that overlook comments to approve before they are published
__label__Support	i definately agree newspaper require multiple moderator who check every story before it gets published to the public
__label__Position	newspaper might remove comment section as a way to prevent hate speech. however, it does remove freedom of speech to those who would like to express themselves through comment section.
__label__Support	Yes, and moderators ensure that comments stick to this
__label__Position	Comments, especially on a heated/controversial topic, can quickly disintegrate into banter and spiral into hateful and hurtful comments. Therefore, it is important to reduce this occurrence with moderators that warn and remove those that cross the line. However, moderators can be biased as well. It is therefore important to first allow multiple moderators from different sides and create a definition of what is considered hate speech so that removal can be justified.
__label__Attack	that will still allow people to write hate speech, coz they can.
__label__Position	i think i good to create a program that can detect key words that used in hate speech.
__label__Support	definately comments section should be monitored before it gets out to the public
__label__Support	I think it would be a good idea to ban commenters for some time, they should be issued with the reasons why their post is offensive at the same time
__label__Attack	Is there any evidence to suggest people prefer the comments?
__label__Position	thats a good idea
__label__Position	Based on the analytics, most people disagree with suggestions put forward so it is difficult to decide on a way to reduce hate speech whilst comment sections still exist. Most people agree that moderation is a good approach, it's just difficult to know if all people doing this will be fair. It might be better to do it with AI so it's non biased.
__label__Position	freedom of speech is important for people to express their view, but that does not allow hate
__label__Position	Based on this thread, most people disagree with the statement so there should be some form of intervention to improve problems with hate speech. I think a fair way is hard to decide on because there are different issues with freedom of speech.
__label__Position	i believe comment are important, to allow people to discuss. sometimes you can get factual information from other people comments
__label__Attack	I agree. Especially people who work in that area of expertise and can give valuable inputs
__label__Support	This will improve the language but not the other content
__label__Attack	Additional administrative workload and time factor for posting comments
__label__Support	This would eliminate inappropriate comments
__label__Position	I believer that it is important to allow comments to encourage dialogue and varied opinions. Perhaps stipulating the rules of what behaviour is accepted in the comments section would assist in reducing the level of hate speech, although there are trolls who feed off doing so. The following article quotes: Dr Philips’ colleague, College of Charleston assistant professor of communication Ryan Milner, studies participatory media and public conversation. He tells me something similar when I ask him if comment sections should be the exception or rule of websites. https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation I think it could be a mistake to make them ‘the rule’ and then just leave them there unattended. I think if you want a comment section – and I believe in the power of voice to public engagement, mounting evidence to the contrary – then it has to [be] alongside a commitment to curating civil engagement. This means technological, editorial, and social steps to make them the agora you want them to be.
__label__Position	I don’t usually write something but I like reading comments. So I don’t want them to be taken away. There should be a combination of factors: moderators and a possibility for the users to vote a comment (like and dislike). Abusive comments should also be reported by the users, making the moderators job easier.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	a team of moderators won't be a viable option because, because people can't posts comments in real time
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.

__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	true there are valid criticism that are necessary
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Attack	Freedom of speech should be always encouraged
__label__Attack	But with freedoms we have to consider the repsonsibilities that come along with those. Your frredoms dont give you a right to infringe uopn anothers right by discriminating agaisnt them. Majority of constituions talk about freedoms and right but we cannot be only selfish and forget about anothers right to freedom and dignity.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Support	Yes this is a very important consideration in that we dont operate in a homogenous society. and culturally we are not the same, so what I consider harsh hate speech might just be considered banter to another group of society.
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	Moderation is the key to retaining freedom of speech in online spaces without allowing hate speech to be spread. Moderators should be screened beforehand to ensure that they are impartial and capable of identifying and removing forms of hate speech against all groups.
__label__Position	Online comment spaces should be platforms promoting free speech, with some restrictions in place. Human or digital moderators (AI) could be used to identify comments and phrases constituting hate speech and remove them from the platform without hindering people's ability to share their authentic views.
__label__Support	I agree, because not all comments will be hate speech, some are positive.
__label__Support	I agree that AI moderators offer an ideal solution. I think it's worth considering that having human moderators would mean that there are individuals who have to read through hate speech regularly. This research article provides more detail on this point: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/09/220916112424.htm
__label__Attack	Do you believe that a newspaper comment section is an appropriate system for dialogue with someone spreading hateful messages?
__label__Position	The main idea would be to create a community that self-regulates itself, in addition to investing in a good IA that identifies hateful comments and the extreme solution would be to only allow accounts registered for more than 1 month (example) to comment
__label__Position	Readers should be able to comment but be informed of certain comments that would be considered hate speech. If they are aware and still choose to comment hateful words, the newspaper website should feel comfortable enough to remove those comments since the reader was informed that comments like those would not be acceptable.
__label__Attack	it is censorship
__label__Position	the removal of comment spaces is not good for the well being of humans because other people share ideas using the comment space and other comments can make certain people happy.
__label__Attack	Other comments can also make other people sad
__label__Attack	yeah they can, but certain AI can be added on newspapers websites to detect and remove hate speech.
__label__Position	Moderating comments could be a viable solution. The use of AI could make it easier given that there could be thousands and thousands of comments, too much for human moderator/s to keep track of.
__label__Support	AI is the way to go for sure since there it's not human-based
__label__Attack	but AI is still weak right now to filter hate speech comments efficiently
__label__Position	Hate-speech is part of free-speech, it's hard to focus on one without affecting the other so what should be done is to write articles differently, a neutral way where both sides can see themselves because we become less aggressive when we feel part of a group
__label__Attack	Hate speech is used to intentionally hurt others. It cannot be allowed in modern-day society and should not be seen as free-speech
__label__Support	That's true. Most social media companies are already using AI to detect and remove hate speech. Here's an article about this: https://www.newsy.com/stories/artificial-intelligence-is-used-to-track-down-hate-speech/
__label__Position	A combination of both human resources and AI seems to be the best solution we have at this stage. AI needs that human touch for more nuanced tracking of hate speech. This article speaks of the combination of these two: https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/08/online-abuse-artificial-intelligence-human-input/
__label__Position	Hate speech can be avoided and combatted on online platforms. This could be through the use of Artificial Intelligence, explaining why speech is hateful and keeping people informed so that they know when speech is hateful. This article goes into further detail. https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2019/04/09/how-should-social-media-platforms-combat-misinformation-and-hate-speech/
__label__Position	By using a tool that searches for likely words: hate, etc.
__label__Support	This is a good idea, there are a lot of sites that use AI bots that block out hate speech, bad words, and they are more appropriate for all ages. Keeps the tone of the comments at a decent level
__label__Support	A similar tool is being used for music, to identify if it's DMCA free or not, if the music is commercial they ban your account online. Same thing should happen with hate speech. Scan the online media for bad words, specifics and then remove the comments all together.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.

__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	hate speech affects people differently, it might not affect some but it differently hurt others
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	It's true that hate speech is discriminatory and can constitute violence, but not all comments on news platforms are hate speech, and some are constructive. People should be allowed to share their authentic views on a subject, as long as those views do not discriminate against specific groups of people.
__label__Support	Banning hate speech cannot be a form of censorship if the views your express incite hate or violoence against other groups.
__label__Attack	hate speech is discrimination, but people should be free to express themselves on websites because not every comment will be hate speech and other people inspire other from comments, without the comment space people will be unable to interact online.
__label__Attack	Eliminating space for readers in its entirety removes any possibility of stimulating discussion. While hate speech is a serious consideration, I would hope that it forms a small minority of the comments posted on newspaper websites (but I guess this also depends on the topic since some are more charged than others). Surely some form of regulation would suffice to address the severity of hate speech.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Attack	The comments section can not create fake news. It may attract people with extreme views but not people making up news themselves.
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

__label__Position	Agreed
__label__Position	Asking for their constructive criticism and how it will benefit the individual and community.
__label__Position	we can do that by having strict rules on language and hate speech where one can be blocked from commenting or their comments gets removed if there is any negativity
__label__Support	Algorithims can be trained to understand what words to display and what not too.
__label__Position	The manner in which questions are asked on newspapers should be directed enlightening for a solution and positive response.
__label__Position	Maybe it is time to increase our love for each other and decrease hatred by practicing empathy. Getting to know each other in the real world will always be more constructive for our society than hating in the virtual world.
__label__Position	totally agree!
__label__Position	I agree with Emily, that perhaps we could all benefit from stepping back a little from the virtual world. The internet does tend to create pockets of like-minded people to air their extreme views with anonymity and this can become dangerous, as we ahve seen with groups such an Incels.

The internet does tend to create pockets of like-minded people to air their extreme views with anonymity and this can become dangerous, as we ahve seen with groups such an Incels.
__label__Position	Ultimately however, I think I have to agree with Patrizia. A comments section is fundamental. We must retain it, whether or not some people believe it garners hate speech or not. Personal attacks towards other people in the comments, for instance, whould not be allowed to stand. But general views, yes
__label__Position	But the virtual world its not a problem. we as people are the ones with unresolved matters
__label__Position	You are very right Diana. But, the virtual world does have its drawbacks. People can become keyboard warriors behind anonymity
__label__Position	having freedom of speech should not give you a right to spread hatred amongst others. there are many ways to be polite at the same time voicing your opinion out
__label__Position	but still people are bias, especially when it comes to serious matter/ or personal matter
__label__Position	There should be no comment area in order to limit hate speech. Newspapers should be one-sided sources of information.
__label__Attack	it is important for media to be criticised in order to validate it we do not have to accept what is written
__label__Support	would move the issue somewhere else
__label__Position	There are various articles and booklets on the internet, freely available, giving recommendations as to how online sites and mdia sites can reduce hate speech. This one says the following ''Social media companies and other internet intermediaries have a legal and ethical responsibility to take effective measures to reduce the dissemination of prohibited hate speech on their digital platforms and to address its consequences. This includes, where appropriate, content moderation'' It seems they are suggesting that all sites that allow public comment should preferably engage moderators to sift out extreme and obscene comments. I think, really, this is the best that can be done without curtailing free speech. Link jere to recomeedations https://www.idi.org.il/media/13570/recommendations-for-reducing-online-hate-speech.pdf
__label__Support	Training AI to do that would be a great way to prevent this phenomen
__label__Position	I agree with so many of the comments above - there are some really good ideas. I think comment sections are needed in newspapers because it's a way to communicate and connect on different topics. There must be another way to reduce hate speech. Censoring words is a good idea. I also agree that it's now newspaper's sole responsibility to stop it so why should they have to remove the comment section.

__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Support	i also agree with lawrenceM as i believe the filters need to be improved and if they arent there, then they need to be made,
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	Sometimes, in the context of a debate, aggressive language is necessarily to demonstrate the emotion of the people and their dissatisfaction

__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	due to the changing world and the improvement of technology,the internet is like a black canvas and anyone can put anything they want on it,but even though technology is improving most websites dont use basic protection,they could do things like add comment filters,then this ensures that hateful words or phrases cannot be used but positive and informative words and statements can be
__label__Support	people can share creative ideas and hateful words and ideas are not used
__label__Attack	There are always cons in any idea
__label__Position	I think we have to use some fact checking system that allows us to present thoughts and opinions, the system can block derogatory comments. This allows for a calm debate
__label__Support	Sometimes, the vocal minority are the ones which are giving the hate speech, having a system allows a voice for those who don't want to speak
__label__Support	One research by the Sage suggest that we are in a world of algorithmic audiencing, whereby we are presented information in a way to increase engagement. This can be good and bad, but often the idea of engagement is most known when there is conflict. HEre's the link https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/02683962211013358

__label__Attack	The same technology that allows social media to galvanise democratic activists can be used by hate groups seeking to organise and recruit. It also allows fringe sites, including peddlers of conspiracies, to reach audiences far broader than their core readership. Online platforms’ business models depend on maximising reading or viewing times. Since Facebook and similar platforms make their money by enabling advertisers to target audiences with extreme precision, it is in their interests to let people find the communities where they will spend the most time.https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons
__label__Support	Unmoderated online comment forums are magnets for noxious speech. For years they have carried people’s discontent out into the world, while the writers sit safely behind screens. It’s almost bittersweet to think back on the time we once blamed internet flaming on the online disinhibition of middle school pranksters. It is the many unhappy adults in the electorate who are posting the things they are really thinking in comment boxes. Nearly three-quarters of internet users – 73 percent – have witnessed online harassment. News website comment sections host antagonistic conversations between contributors. Nine out of 10 respondents of a Pew Research study said the online environment was more enabling of criticism. The squabbling can be overwhelming: As many as 34 percent of news commenters and 41 percent of news comment readers identified argumentative comments as the reason they avoid reading or joining the discourse. Multiple studies show online communities develop sophisticated norms that guide participants. Anger begets more anger. Unshackled digital vitriol is now volleyed back and forth online from all sides. Some commenters don’t even care if they are anonymous anymore. Researchers have found real-name comments on social media are actually nastier than unsigned commentary. Historically, American democracy always had some rudeness baked into it. For example, during the presidential election of 1800, incumbent President John Adams’ campaign proclaimed “murder, robbery, rape, adultery and incest will all be openly taught and practiced” if his opponent, Thomas Jefferson, won the presidency. Jefferson, meanwhile, described Adams as “a hideous hermaphroditical character,” with “neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman.” Civility in public discourse is often what people in power expect of their citizens. Demands for civility can be used by those with authority to deny power to those with none. People who feel marginalized or alienated use incivility and civil disobedience to fight the power. By causing offense and indignation, as we saw during Campaign 2016, outsiders gained massive attention for their cause. Yet “democracy only functions when its participants abide by certain conventions, certain codes of conduct and a respect for the process,” wrote cultural journalist Neal Gabler in an eloquent essay about how a hateful electorate threatens democracy. Gabler noted that the 2016 presidential campaign was referred to as the “hate election” because everyone professed to hate both candidates. It turned out to be the hate election, Gabler mused, “because of the hatefulness of the electorate.” He went on:
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.

__label__Attack	Privacy is incredibly important, I do not believe that you should have to provide personal details in order to participate in discussion.
__label__Attack	The level at which data can be tracked/who this data gets given to could cause repercussions of privacy especially with things like GDPR
__label__Support	Being able to track down those who have posted hate speech would be useful in putting a stop to them and may discourage those who like to post things anonymously from posting in the first place
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	This does sound like a difficult one. There is need for moderators and people who can or artificial intelligence that can screen and delete such comments. I do not think that educating people on being nice will work as some are just bitter for nothing.
__label__Position	news papper sites should filter comments and cancel posts that most promote hate speech
__label__Position	I am not sure you can fairly reduce hate speech without completely removing the comments space. Or you will have to have someone monitoring every single comment made to make sure it is not hateful. Unfortunately all speech is free speech, we just might not like what is being said.
__label__Position	We should not mistaken hate speech for freedom of speech. Trollers and mean people do hide behind that. Have we thought about the consequences of hate speech like suicides?
__label__Position	I think that it is important for readers to be able to comment. I think it is unfortunately inevitable that some people will choose to leave hate speech, there is clearly no easy solution to this, but I do not think that eliminating the comments section is the answer, nor is allowing hate speech to flourish for it has real consquences. I think moderators are perhaps the only solution.
__label__Position	once news is exposed to the internet, everyone has access to it, and right to comment any how they feel about the news, but hate speech is very unacceptable, if you find the news very uncomfortable, just skip the site and find news that suits your needs.
__label__Support	I agree that the hate speech perhaps should not be entirely removed. Sometimes a society has to confront its own ugliness/hatred head on, and removing it might do more harm than good (ie making commenters feel persecuted, perhaps making them even more hateful or violent). I also agree that still being able to access the newspaper might help change their minds.
__label__Position	once news is exposed to the internet, everyone has access to it, and right to comment any how they feel about the news, but hate speech, so an AI that can detect hate speech should be introduce, in that way it will eliminate hate speech not the space for readers comment section
__label__Support	In many ways, the debates confronting courts, legislatures, and publics about how to reconcile the competing values of free expression and nondiscrimination have been around for a century or longer. Democracies have varied in their philosophical approaches to these questions, as rapidly changing communications technologies have raised technical challenges of monitoring and responding to incitement and dangerous disinformation. United States. Social media platforms have broad latitude [PDF], each establishing its own standards for content and methods of enforcement. Their broad discretion stems from the Communications Decency Act. The 1996 law exempts tech platforms from liability for actionable speech by their users. Magazines and television networks, for example, can be sued for publishing defamatory information they know to be false; social media platforms cannot be found similarly liable for content they host.
__label__Support	Recent congressional hearings have highlighted the chasm between Democrats and Republicans on the issue. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler convened a hearing in the aftermath of the New Zealand attack, saying the internet has aided white nationalism’s international proliferation. “The President’s rhetoric fans the flames with language that—whether intentional or not—may motivate and embolden white supremacist movements,” he said, a charge Republicans on the panel disputed. The Senate Judiciary Committee, led by Ted Cruz, held a nearly simultaneous hearing in which he alleged that major social media companies’ rules disproportionately censor conservative speech, threatening the platforms with federal regulation. Democrats on that panel said Republicans seek to weaken policies dealing with hate speech and disinformation that instead ought to be strengthened.
__label__Support	yes, in this way since it will be able to detect hate speech, and readers will still have a chance to news others options, nor to add their thoughts into the account.
__label__Position	This is not just a newspaper comment section problem... it's a social media problem as well, more like an internet problem. We need way to not push people away, but educate them.

Nine out of 10 respondents of a Pew Research study said the online environment was more enabling of criticism. The squabbling can be overwhelming: As many as 34 percent of news commenters and 41 percent of news comment readers identified argumentative comments as the reason they avoid reading or joining the discourse. Multiple studies show online communities develop sophisticated norms that guide participants. Anger begets more anger. Unshackled digital vitriol is now volleyed back and forth online from all sides. Some commenters don’t even care if they are anonymous anymore. Researchers have found real-name comments on social media are actually nastier than unsigned commentary. Historically, American democracy always had some rudeness baked into it. For example, during the presidential election of 1800, incumbent President John Adams’ campaign proclaimed “murder, robbery, rape, adultery and incest will all be openly taught and practiced” if his opponent, Thomas Jefferson, won the presidency. Jefferson, meanwhile, described Adams as “a hideous hermaphroditical character,” with “neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman.” Civility in public discourse is often what people in power expect of their citizens. Demands for civility can be used by those with authority to deny power to those with none. People who feel marginalized or alienated use incivility and civil disobedience to fight the power. By causing offense and indignation, as we saw during Campaign 2016, outsiders gained massive attention for their cause. Yet “democracy only functions when its participants abide by certain conventions, certain codes of conduct and a respect for the process,” wrote cultural journalist Neal Gabler in an eloquent essay about how a hateful electorate threatens democracy. Gabler noted that the 2016 presidential campaign was referred to as the “hate election” because everyone professed to hate both candidates. It turned out to be the hate election, Gabler mused, “because of the hatefulness of the electorate.” He went on:https://theconversation.com/how-news-sites-online-comments-helped-build-our-hateful-electorate-70170
__label__Support	Internet education is definitely needed but not everyone will pay attention or adhere to it regardless
__label__Attack	Censorship can go too far if the power is in the wrong hands. https://youtu.be/YyMGO2MO6GU
__label__Position	Reduce the anonymity that hate-speech writers can hide behind - without that shield some may be less inclined to post because it can be traced back to them
__label__Attack	Racists can no longer hide behind anonymity.
__label__Position	Comments can be vetted and reviewed for key words that might be labelled as hate speech.
__label__Attack	I disagree with this to an extent, in order to have an open debate, both sides would have to be coming at the issue from a similarly open minded position, which realistically is not going to happen.
__label__Position	We shouldn't eliminate comment sections entirely as that comes with its own repercussions but there should be some form of at least minimal moderation available on these sites to ensure that certain topics don't then become completely overwhelmed with negative/hate-filled opinions - as this blog suggests "Comment moderation is essential to grow a digital community. Without comment moderation, you open your community to abuse, profanity and spam—and turn prospective fans and customers away. It’s your responsibility to ensure your brand environment is safe and inviting to your audience." (https://www.smartmoderation.com/the-quick-and-easy-guide-to-comment-moderation)
__label__Position	Maybe if there is a surplus of messages left then all foulmouth comments could be sifted out, allthough i agree this could leed to bias
__label__Position	The more I examine this issue, the more convinced I am that moderation is the key. Often in these situations, one side is coming in specifically to dishonestly represent the facts and in many circumstances, flat out fabricating, I think this article can explain a lot of what I am proposing: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiusKTzsPv6AhXTRMAKHa9vCkQQFnoECC8QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fscience%2Fbrain-flapping%2F2014%2Fsep%2F12%2Fcomment-sections-toxic-moderation&usg=AOvVaw0VBlEl0ndsB4s5IMnsHS4I
__label__Attack	civility is better!
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	eliminating the comment section is more like taking peoples freedoms away as people have the right to freedom of expression
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Support	But comments should be sorted to prevent hate speech
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Attack	An idea doesn't have to be aggressive to be classed as hate speech. It could be dismissive or belittling, or just downright repugnant. Would you be happy to see Nazi opinions put forward in a happy, smiley way?
__label__Support	That said, I'd agree that everyone should be able to express their opinions.....as long as they are public and the accounts are transparent, without the users hiding behind anonymous accounts. If they do that, then consequences can occur.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Attack	However, I tend to agree with this opinion: https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/why-ending-anonymity-would-not-make-social-media-better.php . I don't think hate speech will end with the end of anonymity. We have to think about the possibilities of safety for human rights activists that only come with anonimity.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Attack	I am deeply uncomfortable with the idea of 'tracking people down' for 're-education' for the sin of offering their opinions online (even if said opinions are quite obnoxious).
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Support	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comments_section
__label__Position	Reduce the number of comments.
__label__Attack	The united states supreme court has upheld the right to anonymity: McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/514/334/ "Anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority"
__label__Position	1. Only allow verified accounts to post - these accounts should be easily traced back to individuals. 2. Moderate comments with both algorithms and human visibility. 3. Prosecute.
__label__Attack	This is unlikely to be feasible. United states courts have repeatedly upheld a right to anonymity in this context: https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/why-ending-anonymity-would-not-make-social-media-better.php
__label__Position	We should make sure the personal details are acquired before commenting
__label__Position	People seem slit 50/50 down the middle one half saying newspapers should not have comments sections it should be one sided and the other half saying get the personal details of the commenters incase they do commit hate speech and I agree with the latte still giving people free speech but monitoring it
__label__Position	By having an algorithm that detects and deletes any hate speech comment.
__label__Support	If such a thing can be created then it could work well
__label__Attack	Having an algorithm do the work will inevitably lead to false positives and will also lead to culprits re-tooling their speech to skirt around the algorithm's 'rules'.
__label__Position	There is no one size fits all solution. With some newspapers taking an extreme viewpoint on subjects and individuals, these media outlets are actively encouraging hate speech. No comments should be censored but individuals that type hate speech should be held to account and either prosecuted or are required to attend an educational session - think Speed Awareness courses for low level speeding offences. And website that allows public facing comments should also have strict verification on accounts so people cannot hide behind fake or anonymous accounts.
__label__Position	Provide a reminder to commenters that ensure all comments to remain civil and that some people may not share the same opinion, and that is okay.
__label__Position	Eliminating one's ability to express their opinions on a particular site does not change that opinion. They'll just move to their own echo-chamber elsewhere where it'll fester without being challenged. All that's needed is a reasonable degree of moderation to keep the discussion relatively civil where opponents can have their discussions out in the open.
__label__Position	We are privileged to live in a society with free speech, it is important to keep it this way. Providing a voting system within a comment section allows for free speech to continue and the most relevant comments to remain at the top.
__label__Position	Censoring speech prevents progress as a soceity. (https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2016/04/free-speech-important/)
__label__Attack	Based on this article which i agree with, it is essential for humans to have the freedom to express their opinions. Free speech as given a voice to many groups of people to promote positive change.
__label__Position	It seems like many users think that having your personally details posted along with your comment would be a deterrent for people to comment hate speech
__label__Support	This would persuade people to think about the consequences of hate speech since they will have to take responsibility with people being able to identify them.
__label__Position	Get a group to fairly decide on words that should be banned
__label__Position	We need moderation by a group of individuals with valid reasoning
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Hate speech is some fairly clear definitions, particularly around race and gender [https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech], so it really shouldn't be hard to identify clearly offensive comments directed at a person or group of persons, over valid criticism. The only danger is if the moderator is also biased and does not like an opinion, but in these cases, an independent review will clearly show an abuse of moderator power.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	If a media regulate how people respond to their news, they can aid the fight against hate speech.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Who gets to decide what qualifies as hate speech? If I criticize someone from a protected class for their own bad behavior, what's to stop them from shielding themselves from that criticism by claming it to be hate speech?
__label__Attack	There must be an area for people to voice their opinions, even if some people use it to display aggression.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Attack	the algorithm could be abused by users
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Support	Exactly. Just ignore the hate speech. Like in real life you just ignore the bullies
__label__Attack	Asking people to ignore it is not a solution
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Attack	i enjoy reading comments but some comments can be sweary,name calling, troll like behaviour, which should be stopped.
__label__Support	good point,i see this daily on my local paper,some people make it their hobby to just run down everything and everyone via the comments section.
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Support	if No more trolls, political copy-pastes, or general rudeness and anger are in comments i think both sides of arguement/opinion can be heard.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Attack	It will be difficult to establish the standards for which you regulate people - other than blocking obvious words
__label__Attack	we can't trust people to follow standards
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	Newspapers should not be treated as fora for individuals to share opinions, and only deliver factual basis for news
__label__Position	sorry but we all have an opinion which we are allowed to express but we should also be respectful of others opinions,we should not actively give out hurtful words!
__label__Position	Public opinions on factual media outlets are inappropriate - Forums are are a more appropriate area for opinions and would be simpler to moderate
__label__Attack	Hate speech can be ignored, but does not eliminate it being seen and still potentially causing issues
__label__Attack	There is some evidence that AI systems can be pretty effective at detecting hate speech! For example: https://ai.facebook.com/blog/how-ai-is-getting-better-at-detecting-hate-speech/
__label__Attack	It isn't perfect but it is a pretty decent %
__label__Attack	It will be difficult finding people who will remain unbiased on issues they feel strongly about.
__label__Position	I agree with the comments that worry for the effects of removing comments on free speech - we need to allow for fair and diverse debate. I don't think that newspapers should be restricting comments that are only one side of the debate, as this goes a bit too close to restricting free speech. I agree that certain inflammatory words could be prevented from being used - it is possible that people would get around this, but the fact they are having to get around something might encourage them to reflect on their decision and the reasons behind it.
__label__Position	Freedom of speech should be preserved but it had to be regulated. I think comments should definitely be moderated by people. Banning words or using an algorithm has many flaws such as misuse.
__label__Position	Freedom of speech is important - however hate speech is not important to debate
__label__Attack	this is good idea but some words can have more than one meaning and be used it variety of different sentences. so maybe muting words that could be discrimatory could have its limitations. i.e if you mut the word gay ( this word then count be used it postive topics about gay rights marriages etc .
__label__Position	You can not, which is a sad state of affairs, there cant be free speech without hate speech. The world i now more tolerate of it and it does not shock in the same ways that it used to

__label__Support	I agree
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem

__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Support	I agree completely. People need to be educated
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words.

Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Support	I agree with this statement
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Support	it can be regulated
__label__Attack	how do you regulate what hate speech is and who by?
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__Support	there are some people out there for who having to provide personal information will not be a deterrant to hate speech
__label__Support	I think everyone should have freedom of speech but when it is hurtful to others, that is taking a step to far! Comments should be monitored.
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	Perhaps if there was some form of verification to reduce the hate speeches rather than eliminate free speech completely
__label__Support	It would stop hate speech the easiest way.
__label__Support	I do not agree we should be able to speak up
__label__Support	I think that is an excellent idea, perhaps using some form of AI could be used to cut down costs.
__label__Position	I agree. It is always good to allow people to express their opinions however readers of the comment should also be allowed the freedom to respond by either agreeing, disagreeing or flagging it as inappropriate if the comment is offensive.
__label__Position	Negativity is permitted and valid but hate speech is not. People do not deserve to hide behind the arguement of "free speech" to spread hateful messages
__label__Position	You should be allowed to give your opinion to express your view about a news article. To moderate this or to filter what you can and cannot say would it stop it from being free speech. What really needs to be looked at is to see how you can stop online trolling which I think is the root cause of some of these comment sections become so toxic. But for the media who is so depended on free speech themselves so that they can report on news in an unbiased way to eliminate the comment space is almost hypocritical. Just a weird idea here but perhaps you should do a quick test or verification before you can comment. A lot of people would not go through the effort of completing this if they just want to spread hate.
__label__Support	Really like that idea
__label__Position	I think that the introduction of moderators to remove any hate speech would be beneficial. Perhaps the introduction of guidelines as to what constitutes permitted negative comments.
__label__Support	Good idea. If it is clearly laid out what constitutes as hate speech then there can be no argument on whether or not a comment is deemed as such.
__label__Position	A pop-up can be used which reads "if any 'hate speech' comment is discovered, it will be removed from these comments".
__label__Attack	this literally achieves nothing
__label__Position	By having technology that can detect hate speech so that it can be blocked before it is posted.
__label__Position	I believe that all types of hate speech should be removed. All comments should be pre assessed by an overlooked before comments are posted. We should still be able to comment and have freedom of speach to express an opinion, but no hate speech.
__label__Support	Yes, any form of hate speech should never be tolerated.
__label__Attack	There is nothing wrong with a healthy discussion from opposing sides of an argument. The only issue is when people are posting hate speech. What is hate speech needs to be clearly understood https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech
__label__Position	To proofread comments and remove all hate speech before it is published.
__label__Position	https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/combat-online-hate-speech/
__label__Attack	If the information was moderated & hidden if deemed to be hate speech then it would still exist for the purposes of feedback but not be visible within the comments section
__label__Position	Comments should be monitored

__label__Attack	we can never be sure when it comes to people. It will be dangerous should people be allowed to express themselves
__label__Support	Reduced aggression could lead to less retaliation. If an idea/thought is presented in a balanced way, then a respondent may hopefully be inclined to respond accordingly.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	The moderation can be subject to the Moderator's own thoughts/opinions.
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	Moderation can be seen as restricting free speech.
__label__Support	Being respectful , tolerant of opinions and being open minded is a positive step.
__label__Attack	Cannot guarantee 100% data protection.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	Without the option for comments, the news providers become the sole voice of an opinion.
__label__Position	i agree that moderators have their uses but then unless they are trained properly their biases may creep in
__label__Support	Training is essential for the Moderators. Moderator will support monitoring.
__label__Support	removing certain words would definitely prevent people from purposely stirring up hatred through the comment speech
__label__Support	Persons will have to think before responding.
__label__Position	Commenters should agree to abide by all rules when signing up to the website and he banned for breaking the rules. Also all submitted comments must be thoroughly checked for negative for flagged words or topics. Also I think it would reduce the chances of this happening if users could not reply to each other or comment on others opinions. It's about each users initial opinion on a certain subject and less about judging others opinions on what they think!!!!
__label__Support	Somewhat agree with this statement. The marginalised are oftentimes the focus of hate.
__label__Position	they need to as often it is minorities which are affected
__label__Position	https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-63291527
__label__Support	Taking us to a reputable source.
__label__Position	removing comment sections on newspapers to avoid hate speech will never benefit anyone and will not solve the issue but it might help applying algorithm that will track words and sense tone from messages typed in by individuals. If the algorithm sense vulgar or hateful tone than must not allow the message to be posted.
__label__Position	Eliminating space for readers is not the solution because most of the time we use the platform to share our experience and knowledge with other readers which might be helpful for other people.a person who use hate speech need to be blocked .
__label__Position	After going through all the other comments ,my opinion on the topic has not changed. Newspaper Websites are where people should get the news from ONLY, not write their opinions. They can go express their opinion else where about what they have read , not on the website.
__label__Position	readers are always reading for knowledge of something new, something exciting and adventurous and this sometimes make them want to ad more to express their feeling to the writer. These feeling will not always be seen as good comments because some people are born careless about other people's feeling and they write as they please. I say this platform called "bcause" already has the perfect option on how to use the comment section perfectly and this is to use the option of "PROS AND CONS"
__label__Position	Comments on newspapers should be there for people to voice out their thoughts about certain topics because that is the only way to learn and interact with each other therefore the should be measures taken to monetize people's comment and delete those that are hate speech and irrelevant to that topic.
__label__Position	It would be easier if the submitted comment had to be approved before being posted.
__label__Position	There should be a strict comment management system in place, someone has to supervise it and react (and possibly penalise) to users spreading hate speech. The comments should not be anonymous since people feel more inclined to be hostile when hiding under a pseudonym. Maybe asking to verify your identity before posting a comment would make people think more before spreading hate.
__label__Position	I disagree and like to see others adding narrative and story to a topic. If it was just about news then it might as well be a list of bullet points rather than human interest or social history
__label__Position	I recognise that the comments can generate very divisive view points and generate much tension. Persons should be allowed to speak freely, but there needs to be balance.
__label__Position	The debate can be seen in the discussion here: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21670811.2020.1837638
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Attack	yes i agree with you, the comment section should remain open but people have to remember to be respecyful and consider other peoples emotions
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	we will not hear other peoples opinion, so this is not a good idea
__label__Position	Readers comments are often divisive and poorly researched.
__label__Position	I think the comment section should be open for people to participate in because this helps p[eople understand the information more and what peoples onions are but they should definitely be regulated and anyone that is nasty hating or threatening should be banned.
__label__Position	should be open to all
__label__Support	This leaves space for people to bully and be toxic without any consequences
__label__Support	Yes I agree, but guidance on acceptability and respect is often needed
__label__Position	using key words and having moderators might help
__label__Support	i agree, people who repeatadly post negative hateful comments need to have suspensions and bans
__label__Position	I also believe that a filter or having a group of moderators constantly filtering out the negative - hate speech would be beneficial. Similar to other social media platforms, users of the platform perhaps should be allowed to flag or report comments that aren't appropriate,and then a moderator should check the report and take the steps necessary to make the platform a safe space.
__label__Support	It is very difficult to police all the contributions
__label__Position	More control by moderators plus a code of conduct for users
__label__Position	It might work better if there is a clear process for other readers to be able to escalate or report comments that are offensive, incite hate or otherwise in breach of the code of conduct.
__label__Position	I still think a fliter needs to be added and then a mod can look over any comments that are flagged. This would likely stop people from leaving hate, if they know that their comments will not be posted/seen by anyone.
__label__Position	It is true that it would be difficult to remove and control all of the comments however i think it would be a lot more damaging to remove the right to freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	i dont think being able to use hate speech, racist/homophobic language
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of self publicity. If the community isolates the perpetrators by flagging negative content that would be helpful. Flagged content would then need to be followed by banning perpetrators
__label__Attack	should be included in free speech
__label__Position	Hate speech is so prevalent nowadays that proper measures should be taken in order to limit these harmful comments. However to stop people from expressing their opinions is creating another problem altogether. Those who aren't able to make help contributions should be blocked and stripped of their right to do so.
__label__Attack	Stripping perpetrators of the right to post is very appropriate as it takes away from the individual his desire to promote his views.
__label__Position	The newspaper must filter hate speech words
__label__Position	Nowadays with the amount of social media platforms that are available newspapers don't hold as much power. We get all of our news through the spreading of news in social media as seen in this article : https://kettlemag.co.uk/social-media-versus-print-media/

__label__Position	Newspaper should avoid subscription from people who use hate speech
__label__Support	It could help but would not solve the problem
__label__Position	The use of a system that detect hate speech before publishing
__label__Support	It could be tried
__label__Position	having moderators approve comments
__label__Attack	can algorithms be trusted
__label__Support	very time consuming
__label__Position	having comments moderated to ensure no harmful things get posted
__label__Position	It could be community moderated. Down vote and hide options if multiple people think it is not appropriate
__label__Position	There are many news sites, that have recently been found to not fact check and the apology or retraction oes not reach the level the original false article raised. I think the comments section can be invaluble to allow people to discuss and not be so one sided.
__label__Position	Unesco suggest 5 ways to counter hate speech in the media, (https://en.unesco.org/5-ways-to-counter-hate-speech) within this they suggest the regulation / moderation of comments and socal media as well as ending the impunity for hate speech online.

Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Support	true
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Attack	not fair on those who don't mean hate
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Newspapers have a duty of care to the reader so they should be vigilant
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Position	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Attack	Surely it is possible to have a free exchange of ideas without resorting to hate speech. There must be a level of basic human respect that can be maintained.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speech from newspaper platforms without eliminating space for readers comments I personally think when a hate speech has been posted, a report must be made immediately and the admin can deleted the hate speech
__label__Position	Overall, the comment section is a very critical part of a news paper website. Putting measures in place to allow fair and commenting for the users will help a lot and it will also boost the websites traffic as people will know that the website is safe for people to engage without receiving hateful comments.
__label__Position	Research in computer science addresses phenomena, such as toxic comments (van Aken et al., 2018), offensive language (Chen et al., 2012), abusive speech (Nobata et al., 2016), or profanity (Sood et al., 2012). Hate speech is frequently – but not always – used as a synonym. Equating hate speech with offensive language is insofar problematic as a comment can be offensive without referring to a target group. When scholars consider this group reference in their definitions, they often concentrate on explicit racist terms or consider other characteristics (e.g., religion or sexual orientation) that are used to stigmatize groups (e.g., Davidson et al., 2017; ElSherief et al., 2018; Silva et al., 2016). But researchers who use ethnic slur lists seldom distinguish between user-generated communication addressing individuals or generalizing derogatory speech to a whole social group. The main goal of computer scientific research is the automatic detection of hate speech in large quantities of data. To classify hate speech, one can choose a deductive approach, using dictionaries consisting of lists of ethnic slurs or category-specific swearwords. An issue regarding these keyword-based approaches is the nature of language. It is never static, the degree of formality and tone changes depending on the platform where user-generated content is published. Additionally, users adapt their writing or choice of words quickly to avoid censorship. (https://www.cairn.info/revue-questions-de-communication-2020-2-page-529.htm)
__label__Position	Some of these comments help other readers on ways to improve in certain areas of their lives but at the same time they can hinder others. I think speech platform should be controlled in a way that does not make the public feel bad
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Support	Technology should be able to parse out hate speech which has no room in any argument
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours

__label__Support	Total elimination of comments would not allow a discussion to take place
__label__Support	It could help others have an opinion but in a positive non hurtful way
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	I think it could cause more harm than good as people would find another way to
__label__Position	I feel like there are certain topics for which disabling comments is the best option. For example extremely sensitive stories about severe crimes or ones that involve children.
__label__Position	There could also be a disclaimer added before one can see other comments which encourage readers to fact-check and be mindful of what they're reading, while also having moderators.
__label__Support	I agree, that feels like a reasonable approach. Although I'm a little bit skeptical what comes to its effectivity.
__label__Position	We could add a moderating element to the newspaper site in order to prevent hurtful comments
__label__Attack	Because hate speech causes so many unwanted consequences, this kind of liberal approach doesn't seem fruitful. Although education and counter-speech are important (https://www.coe.int/en/web/european-commission-against-racism-and-intolerance/hate-speech-and-violence), we have to protect free speech while eliminating comments that incite violence.
__label__Position	Take a few minutes to breathe, meditate, and physically calm your body down before you start typing your response.
__label__Position	We can eradicate the anonymity of commentators so that they can understand that they will be held accountable for their comments.
__label__Position	Bad comments have to go if you got a bad comment you should delete and report
__label__Position	we can get a team of comment readers to proof read every comment and delete the hateful ones, because I don't think every comment is a hate speech.
__label__Support	Absolutely there is no form of constructive hate speech. It is all completely destructive.
__label__Position	Hate speech is something is completely unacceptable and should be eradicated by all means necessary however regulations are our best bet if we are to maintain freedom of speech at the same time.
__label__Position	I dont think we can eliminate hate speech from newspaper headlines. ONe idea could be do censor certain words, however, I think it is more important to educate people on their stance so they do no worry / are not concerned by others hateful words
__label__Attack	Calling on the denegration on other people is not "Having an opinion" your view is your own, and you can have it, however when that overlaps into criticising other people for no other reason than they are differrent is not a "view", it is bigotry. So there needs to be some form of moderation.
__label__Support	It is important to give everyone a point of view and allow them a space to voice it, within reason.
__label__Position	Moderating comments is a far better method than eliminating comments entirely. I feel a method for reporting comments, though not perfect, is better, and then reported comments can be examined and removed if necessary.

__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.

__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Support	I agree, this would be the perfect balance
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Attack	I feel this really limits free speech. Speech should be free as long as it's not harmful. Not all comments are mean/come from bad intentions. Without having additional comments, there wouldn't be a richness of opinion in the news.
__label__Attack	I strongly agree with your point due to people posting negative comments and can also lead to cyberbullying in a way. I feel like policies need to be in place to ensure that people who misuse the online newspaper website face certain consequences and the people who have access to the comment section also their accounts needs to be properly register for tracing.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I think also need to consider the peoples rights and ensure that they reduce the hate speech and increasingly integrate many forms of social media into their intimate, social and political lives, produce, are exposed to, and combat hate speech online.
__label__Support	This is a good idea, people might not even realize what can be classed as hateful if they've never experienced it before.
__label__Attack	People with genuine hateful intentions will not change because of this.
__label__Attack	This would completely eliminate everyone elses' chance for discussion
__label__Attack	Commenting on online platforms with hate speech is a lazy, cowardly way of spreading negativity. If those who partake in this sort of online behaviour lacked the platform to do this, I don't think they would act out in other ways. I think they spread hate online as it's a very easy way to do so and takes no energy and is anonymous.
__label__Support	I do think that people just comment on things even if they don't have a strong opinion about it, just because it's easy to. This is why I feel they wouldn't act out in another way if the commenting platforms were taken away, as they inherently don't actually feel passionately about an issue enough to put energy into opposing it.
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed

__label__Position	This is a win or loose situation. People will still continue with their comments even if it is not on the newspapers website. A person can take a screenshot of the topic and then twit it on twitter and then people will give their different opinions. The newspaper can still allow for readers comment however, the hate speech comments can be filtered. This is a democratic world and people have a right to have an opinion in what becomes available to them
__label__Support	I think in the cases of newspapers, the hateful comments can be removed before print. If it's an online platform then said user can be shadowed
__label__Position	Removing hate speech comments is also not a good thing because with the technology that we have, people will go and create fake accounts and still go back to comment hatefully and disrespecting words of which it will be a daunting task to delete all the comments
__label__Attack	Yes people are very technological savvy and capable of using fake accounts to continue spreading whatever comments without consideration and that makes it hard to trace them.
__label__Position	Hate speech will forever be a problem in society and its up to the newspapers website to make sure they publish newsworthy news that even if they come across negative comments, they know that on their side their story is true and there a no loopholes
__label__Support	We can never run away from hate speech
__label__Position	Hate speech can also be reduced by having a like or dislike option on the each comment. This would show how people like or dislike a certain comment. Just like how YouTube has a like or dislike option, the same should be done for the newspapers website
__label__Support	By monitoring the comments, it will make decent people to enjoy the platform and it will make the website respectful
__label__Position	People will always have something to say, either good or bad. The newspapers website should have credible sources from where they get their information from and also publish well articulated sentences to avoid unnecessary hate comments.
__label__Attack	By making rules we might lose some viewers.
__label__Support	Having rules will make online engagement respectful.
__label__Position	Hate speech in a form of criticizing the newspaper website can be a good thing for the website to improve here and there. Not all hate speech is bad
__label__Position	Another way for the community to participate in moderation may be to issue genuine warnings to people, this also goes more towards the root of the problem, telling people they are in the wrong, rather than shutting the door on them so they can post their opinion somewhere else. https://www.popsci.com/technology/nyu-researches-hate-speech-warnings-twitter/
__label__Position	i do not believe that speech should be restricted just like that. what constitues as hate speech? and what constitues as fair criticism? i believe the people today have become very sensitive and cannot critically think because of censorship of important thoughts and ideas. if we dont censor oversexualisation and crude language, why should we censor criticism? i believe hate speech which incites harm and calls for negativity flat out should be what is flagged by the administrators or moderators and the people should vote on it, not just one person.
__label__Position	newspapers are there to give news.most times it is not the comments which bring the hate but rather the non ethical journalism that we have online and physically today. newspapers should not have comments and rather do what they were made to do: deliver news and let the people think for themselves. i believe too many people rely on other comments and interpretations of news to make up their mind, eliminating critical thinking.
__label__Position	ithink the best thing to do is to not have comments as that can really alter someone elses perception. Especially in this day and age people tend to rely on comments to then pass their own judgement and that can cause hate speech. However if the comments were to still be present i think an idea would be to mute comments that incite any type of hate.
__label__Attack	I disagree, comments are how valid opinions are spread and change is made in the world. If there are no comments, there's no feedback.
__label__Support	The establishment elites will never stop the truth, they don't want to be criticised in any way. If truth is banned in online media, people will find another way of discussing truth, like samizdat in Soviet Union
__label__Support	Young people will risk being silenced
__label__Attack	Genuine hate speech will be ignored with that view
__label__Position	I beileve that the algorithm discussed in the 'Most Contested Position' is the way to go forward. Allowing people the chance to express opinions, but detecting and removing hateful or offensive comments.
__label__Position	I also think detecting & moderating potentially hateful comments both through algorithms and manual reporting is the best way to go about it. Comments should be held back for review if there's any reports or detection of potential hate speech. When reporting, people should have the space to briefly explain their reason for reporting though because a lot of times, hate comments can be nuanced or reference things that will often go above the heads of those reviewing the reports if they only have a very basic list of types of report they can choose from.
__label__Position	I think that the warning system is a good route, as the AI might eliminate valid arguments and miss hate speech accidentally. A warning system would still need an AI, but it warns users that their comment may be hate speech and if it is, the user can rethink their wording or risk posting it. If they post it, maybe a manual review can happen to determine if it was hate speech or not.
__label__Support	I like this idea - there could also be a warning system for those reading the comments, if something does get published that possibly shouldn't have. A warning stating that the following comment may be offensive and contain hate speech.
__label__Attack	I like the idea of AI. but it still seems to fail a lot of the time: https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/04/1025742/ai-hate-speech-moderation/
__label__Position	love this idea actually!
__label__Position	A combination of a warning system, detailing what might be considered hate speech and a manual review if potential hate speech is detected as well as on manual reports (allowing brief descriptions for reasons for reporting) seems like a good way to go about it. People who have a history of posting more than one hate comment on the platform should be moderated each time before their comment gets publicised whether it's detected as hate speech by the algorithm or not. They would lose the privilege of being able to comment instantly without review.
__label__Position	freedom of speech is essential but hate speech is not. comments should be left on but perhaps there could be a programme which finds key words and eliminates the comment if it seems to be hateful
__label__Support	I like that this comment shares the views of a doctor, from a genuine and respected source
__label__Position	In this same article, there is a section further down using reddit as an example. A particular subreddit inroducted strict rules for their comment section, and with over 30 moderators, people follow them and create a good environment. This shows that it is possible to moderate the comments and have a good, healthy comment section https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation
__label__Support	It's a good idea to reduce anonymity so more people can be linked to the things they say and rightly may think twice about coming across as a hateful person.
__label__Attack	although I do think that, however, we should consider how many people do in fact post hateful comments without the protection of anonymity. look at Facebook, for instance - it's absolutely full of hate speech from people posting under their names using accounts that people can view and learn more about them. perhaps if people are truly hateful then being known for this isn't a problem for them after all.
__label__Attack	reflecting on this, and the use of AI - here is a statement from Facebook about monitoring hate speech and now allowing these comments on the platform: https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/policies/community-standards/hate-speech/
__label__Attack	c onsidering that information, and the hate speech which is still on Facebook - is AI able to work effectively?
__label__Support	By holding them liabile it will remove negativity on the platform.
__label__Support	The comments need to hidden from the public comments and get approved to be viewed in online newspaper website.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	Some feedback is sometimes good for the growth of the newspaper website
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	I strongly agree with your opinion, however the reader comments need to be respect as a platform despite people having the right to freedom of speech.
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Attack	Algorithms also have issues and can be inherently racist: https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/18/21121286/algorithms-bias-discrimination-facial-recognition-transparency
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Attack	Not if the idea is hateful to minorities.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	Exactly, regulation is necessary, either by a software or an actual person
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	I disagree, comment sections allow the public to engage with the news and find people similar to them
__label__Attack	But what can be done about it? Will anything be done even with a report button
__label__Position	Someone should monitor the comments in the website such as administrator or moderator. Or comments need to review first by administrator before it can be posted on the website
__label__Position	I think we firstly have to call out hate speech in order for people to learn that it is not okay and unacceptable. The reason being online 'haters' tend to abuse their right to free speech such that it infringes upon the next person because they have the comfort of knowing that nobody will find put who they really are and confront them. By calling out users on the newspaper website and responding to their comment as the moderator of the comments, and actually suspending their accounts because of it can go a long way.
__label__Support	Having a moderator and strict rules in place to ban or suspend accounts that express a form of hate speech is needed. Actually replying to that comment as the newspaper will show everyone else that it really is not okay
__label__Position	Well..hate speech is a problem then there is freedom of speech as well. There is a possibility a writer is giving valid points.
__label__Position	Report button on every comment so that people can report hate speech from other users. This would require an actual person or software to evaluate the reported comments
__label__Support	I agree, people should have the newspaper identify hate speech, but also the newspaper needs to actually evaluate the reported comments
__label__Position	I think an idea can be given without cussing and there should be a report button if someone is getting aggressive.
__label__Position	Would require you to identify the hate speech so that people can learn that it is unacceptable and harmful to the readers of such comments. The keyboard warriors tend to abuse the freedom of speech. removing the the comment section would not be a good idea as we tend to be intriguid by the kind of feedback certain posts receive.
__label__Position	The best solution would be one that elegantly ties the reduction of hate speech in the comment section with no detrimental effect to the publics freedom of speech. This could be done by setting guidelines for hate speech, and also ensuring that the public provides identifying information such as their email address and especially their phone number. Both can be tracked to the person. To take it even further would be to be able to collect data such as ip addresses( with the commenters permission of course) when the person sends their comment so as to be able hold them accountable for any hate speech they send in. This will prevent people from using such language and hoping to hide under anonymity.
__label__Support	People would be more careful with what they say
__label__Position	I found this interesting article on how the United Nations suggests people react to hate speech directed at them or their organisation. https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/take-action/engage
__label__Support	Agreed, and it would still allow opinions to be shared
__label__Position	This article describes how censoring might lead users to leave platforms and join other platforms with lighter censoring rules https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/global-extremes/does-censoring-radical-right-social-media-work/
__label__Position	comment sections are necessary so we can see different opinions on one topic

__label__Position	comment sections are necessary so we can see different opinions on one topic
__label__Position	Hate speech, although in many cases is specifically excluded from freedom of speech, is often difficult to regulate. In such cases then subjectivity or bias can be used and that could be seen as a violation of the right to freedom of expression. This makes the whole situation a grey area and it is only by further encouraging dialogue and conversation that can we get closer to a definitive answer on this. Here is an article that addresses the trouble with regulating hate speech. https://www.thefire.org/is-hate-speech-protected-by-the-first-amendment/
__label__Position	There needs to be a fine balance between freedom of expression and stopping hate speech. The best way is for comments to be screened as that would still allow opinions to be shared while ensuring the safety of all readers
__label__Support	This article also discusses the use of moderators https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	I agree with your suggestion
__label__Attack	Totally agree but the team of moderators might be a high cost for the newspaper, especially if they need to evaluate every comment
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Attack	I do agree with you, but I think the people also should have a way of reporting comments.
__label__Support	I absolutely agree. It's newspapers responsibility that these comments do not end up in their comment section.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Support	i think so,people should be able to express their views but comments must be moderated
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	definitely agree with this comment,there is no place for aggression in an adult debate
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Support	Correct
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Support	Yes, public should also be able to express an opinion on a subject.
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	Requires a lot of moderation
__label__Attack	all criticism cannot be considered hate crime, sometimes it can be the harsh truth. How can we make sure these comments don't get deleted too.
__label__Support	Moderating will reduce hate speech and allow open discussion without personal, insulting opinions
__label__Support	I agree with the idea that anonymity on the Internet often has the consequence to make it easier for people to harass / be horrible to each others.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	You can ban some words, that usually helps a lot.
__label__Position	by tighter regulation of newspapers and make them responsible for their content, make them vet and verify all contributed content
__label__Position	every comment submitted by readers must be checked internally for hate speech
__label__Attack	That will take too long time to do manually, so it's best to ban some words in the start. If the user is using to many of the banned words, then ban the user automatically.
__label__Position	we cannot eliminate all contributions nor reduce free speech but all newspapers and content providers must acknowledge the role they play in spreading hate and disinformation
__label__Position	Limitation of words one can post, both minimum and maximum; this would force people to come up with better way of criticising, meaning a less likely chance for hate speech if they have to put in some brainpower to formulate what they want to say
__label__Position	I would disagree richard, newspapers can often fuel hate speech through their phrasing and the way they choose to title their articles therefore it is down to them to avoid hate speech spreading on their websites.
__label__Support	Some people are going through problems in their own life and express their anger online. None of which is acceptable.
__label__Position	People will not be aware if they are not taught about something, awareness campaigns need to be made to teach people about the importance of avoiding hatespeech as some of them do it due to the lack of knowlege.
__label__Position	By making people aware that hate speech is not good by creating awareness campaigns against hate specch.
__label__Position	Awareness campaigns need to be implemented to teach people about the significance of avoiding hate speech.
__label__Attack	It is hard to rely on awareness campaigns, as people who write hate speech are not very interested in any awereness campaing
__label__Position	The newspaper could automate hate speech content deletion. For example certain shares could be automatically deleted/removed.
__label__Position	it is very important not to be hateful to other people and their opionions,rather just not say anything.
__label__Position	people should be taught how to be kind and the implications of how their words could affect other people.
__label__Position	people should be taught how to be kind and the implications of how their words could affect other people.
__label__Position	They should automatically detect hate speech whenever detected and the delete it, that would be much better.
__label__Position	only constructive criticism should be allowed
__label__Attack	Using moderators and flagging can be abused to prevent valid comments. If the moderator doesn't like what you have written, or if there are several users who doesn't like you on the platform, they can abuse the flagging. Just look at YouTube and how many abuse the flagging to get rid of a channel or person who they don't agree with and who have strong opinions you don't agree with.
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	I agree, and I think it's best to ban some words that will offend people. I also think the users who are trolls should be banned early on to protect the comment section.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.

__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Support	I agree, i think several moderators should be put in place to review the comments.
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Support	I agree, its best to be respectfull whether you agree with an article or not.
__label__Support	Opinions shouldn't be classed as "hate speech". If some people (snowflakes) get triggered by different points of view they should refrain from reading the comments section rather than whine about "hate speech".
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Attack	Newspapers by their nature are polarised entities. Banning comments to diminish polarised opinions makes little sense if the newspapers themselves are pumping out polarised opinions.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	I think people should have the right to comment but should do so respectfully.
__label__Attack	I disagree - people should comment where it is appropriate but not on topics where the public is largely misinformed or can spread misinformation such as climate change. Comments on topics like celebrities are ok because they ultimately don't matter when compared to an important science-policy debate.
__label__Attack	I disagree. In an Institute for Government webinar yesterday (24/10 https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/events/what-works-government-evidence-policy) the point was made that the public are not educated to challenge what they read in the media. It is therefore naive to assume that people would start to search around things they read in the news because 1) we are not taught how to do this and 2) there is no motive for people to begin to do this. Based on the amount of conspiracy documentaries on Netflix and YouTube it is possible that people would indeed search around what they read but for negative/conspiracy motives rather than as ground truthing.
__label__Position	We can reduce hate speech by giving fair and non-critical comments that does not necessarily aim at bashing or making readers uncomfortable. We can be guided by acts that protect readers and that may try reducing hate speech without reducing the actual freedom of expression or speech.
__label__Position	hate speech is a reflection of two sides of a story ,all side of the story need to be published to allow the public to make up their own minds .
__label__Position	I agree with FransescoT online forums can be a wonderful community but hate speech with faceless people can ruin it. If you want to comment there should be some accountability.
__label__Attack	Some people with genuine or kind comments may be put off interacting
__label__Position	moderation is is very helpful in these instances,also having certain keywords automatically blocked.
__label__Position	We could put a system in place that would automaticly delete and report any comments that contain hate speach.
__label__Position	First, it would be important to define what hate speech is so that readers that want to post comments have a chance to self-modify their posts. Secondly, having a filter that will automatically block posts that contain proscribed words could also help to reduce the amount of hate speech featured in comments sections.
__label__Attack	The problem is some form of censorship would be required for writers if the definition of "hate speech" isn't universally agreed. Perhaps a trigger warning for readers of a sensitive disposition could be given at the start of an article. Different countries have different laws or understandings of hate speech. Will comments from different countries have to be blocked?
__label__Position	I think that education with penalties such as exclusion from the community for repeated offences is the best policy. Like many I agree that some people are unaware they unaware they have caused offence to others.
__label__Position	However there is the potential to much greater exposure to it on online than in past times. Therefore I continue to believe that greater controls on those posting comments will decrease mindless hate speech and promote constructive debate.
__label__Attack	The problem is hate speech really means political speech. It's a way of silencing dissent of political agendas that are transforming certain countries societies in a way people don't like.
__label__Attack	Free speech is the cornerstone of democracy - it can be political but it doesn't have to be. Democracies should protect those that are vulnerable from abuse online whilst also preserving the spirit of free speech. If this balance can't be achieved then it is dictatorship / authoritarian territory.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	I think this is a bad idea. The comments section is an important means of debunking biased articles or potentially gaining a different perspective on what others think about what you've just read.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	We need to distinguish between hate speech and political speech. Differences of opinions should not be classed as hate speech.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	I think it is the responsibility of the websites to moderate any hatefull comments. You can agree and disagree with somthing without hate.
__label__Support	A very good point. So-called hate speech is often used by leftists to silence political opponents.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Attack	Absolutely agree,and public opinion seems to favour this approach.
__label__Attack	A legal framework is needed to ensure that media outlets don't censor speech on the basis that it is opposite to their views, with the justification that it was hate speech.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Attack	Absolutely agree with you;removing the comments section will achieve nothing as it will drown out even sound contributions to the discussion(s).
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Attack	I think if saying something out loud in a public place would get you arrested, you should not be allowed to type it online.
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Attack	That is the problem not everyone thinks that they saying something hateful until someone mentions it.
__label__Attack	I don't think the intention is to be aggressive but sometimes expressing yourself may lead to saying things that hurt other people.
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Support	It could help return newspapers to places where people seek news rather than skip content to get to simply debate/abuse!
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Support	I like the balanced approach suggested.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	https://www.dw.com/en/turkey-introduces-jail-terms-for-disinformation/a-63435062 Here is an example of a news article, which highlights the potential dangers/misuse of personal datas provided to social media and news sites. Although this is not a UK based news item, it is an example of how information can be mis-used.
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	This closes the possibility of healthy debate and non-hate speech.
__label__Attack	I don't think this would a particularly helpful thing to do. Comment sections help readers make their contribution(s) to the discourse. Perhaps the development of algorithms that work through the comments to identify what's inappropriate and remove it.
__label__Position	I believe in an element of balance. Comment spaces should be available to maintain the opportunity for debate and opinion. However, hate speech and bullying should not be tolerated by publications. Moderators should be in place alongside fair 'flagging' systems allowing readers to highlight comments of concern. This could also be used for debates between those commenting, as these can often turn personal.
__label__Position	I think it is important to consider setting rules such as no hate speech if found then you will be removed. In this way it will limit hate speech.
__label__Position	I feel that all users should provide true identification that can be used if they use hate speech to find them/report them.
__label__Attack	I have heard some users fear this. For instance, those who post anonymously about their sexuality or gender in countries where they may face issues in cases of hacking/user info being made public.
__label__Support	In theory, I really like this idea and feel it could minimise bullying and hate speech online.
__label__Position	I understand that there will always be people saying the comment section needs to stay as we are all allowed free speech.
__label__Position	This would be a possibility, although even if people do not use their real names and details it is easy to track people online if they do not use a vpn (virtual private network) or tor (onion router). Connecting to a website reveals your ip address and a whole load of information which would be enough to track a person if a hate crime had been committed.
__label__Position	This is an interesting point - I wonder if some websites already use AI to moderate user comments and posts. I think AI could be trained to recognise hate speech, although it would have to be tested first as it could censor too much.
__label__Attack	I don't think they do. From what I see some newspapers want to know exactly how people feel even if what is written causing a bit of chaos
__label__Position	In today's world where technology has advanced to such a degree, I'm of the belief that creating parameters that protect individuals from any form of hate speech is very much possible through things such as AI. The removing of commenting sections could be argued as a violation to one's freedom of speech, it also means the views and opinions of the public will be lost which could have detrimental effects.
__label__Support	We really are in a high tech age and seem to have the ability to create all sorts of platforms, so we should be able to help moderate them via AI and similar.
__label__Position	In my opinion,scrapping comments sections is not the best way to go about dealing with the issue(s) around hate speech on news platforms. The sensible thing to do is to monitor comment sections for hate speech in order for it to be removed and the evidence suggests that the public is in support of such measures(https://mediaengagement.org/research/how-the-public-views-deletion-of-offensive-comments/),granted the moderators, whether it's a human or AI, remain neutral.
__label__Support	I agree with this, this tools can be helpful in reducing hate speech
__label__Position	It has been shown that comments sections are popular and do drive traffic to websites and make people spend more time on the site (so pleasing advertisers) So from a commercial/publishing point of view it would seem that some kind of moderation is the best way to deal with the problem and not eliminate the section altogether. (See https://webpublisherpro.com/your-website-needs-a-comments-section/)
__label__Position	Many companies are relying on AI tools to track down and remove hate speech. https://respondology.com is one of the tools that can be used by newspaper websites to reduce hate speech.
__label__Position	Hate speech can and does stop genuine free speech. This article implores us not to read the comments as they can stifle the voices of minorities. https://theconversation.com/dont-read-the-comments-misinformed-and-malicious-comments-stifle-indigenous-voices-180576
__label__Position	If we start to moderate speech online too heavily, we will push more people to radicalisation in dark web groups
__label__Position	Readers comments are an important space and whilst it's possible that people use them for hate speech, others use them to express informed opinions and for healthy debate.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	Time
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Support	information
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Attack	But the perpetrator of said hate speech should also be informed as to what they did wrong. Sometimes people might do these things out of simple ignorance and others are just genuine and deliberate in their actions.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Support	True people should be able to express their opinions
__label__Attack	However, we need a solution for this, else we may not be able to have any platforms at all.
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	Compelling argument
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	This may work
__label__Attack	Issue with time and who gets priority for arguments
__label__Attack	Hoping that they may publish is wishful thinking as well unless they have a system for it.
__label__Support	A different perspective
__label__Support	I actually really like this idea - it deals well with the issue of removing hate speech as nothing just gets automatically published and checked later. Yes it will cut down on the amount of comments overall but even that isn't a bad thing, if only the most coherent, high-quality comments are published.
__label__Support	I believe having the ability to read through the comments of other is very important when making decisions. The fact that monitoring is weak across most platforms is the biggest issue.
__label__Support	Allows space for other perspectives to be published.
__label__Position	I believe people should be freely allowed to express their opinions on whatever form of information is presented to them. However, there is etiquette to everything we do. If you cannot produce a compelling argument without approaching the area of hate speech then the internet isn't for you. I believe in order to regulate these areas, participants and viewers should be informed of any rules and regulations to the newspaper website, then accepting or declining said rules will give you access. In the case of a violation of the rules, moderators should remove individuals from the space, essentially banning them as they did not follow the rules, in that case they will need to message an administrator to possibly receive access once again.
__label__Position	I think there should at least be a 'report' button and any hate speech reported should be removed.
__label__Attack	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button
__label__Attack	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button
__label__Attack	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button
__label__Attack	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button
__label__Position	There is always going to be hate speech and comments, that is the way of the world unfortunately these days. But I do think it needs monitored more closely
__label__Position	by letting users know that hate speech can not be tolerated and then putting measures that can limit use of hate speech (warnings, report buttons, blocking, locking of accounts and also sensitizing users of consequences of using hate speech on comments space.
__label__Position	By warning users that hate speech will have consequences of being eliminated and blocked from the page and also making the system to monitor such users actively
__label__Attack	Some hate speech might actually be illegal, it should not be kept (https://www.report-it.org.uk/reporting_internet_hate_crime)
__label__Attack	Also it's not about restricting any form of hate speech, we also need to be reminded that our opinions can't be the only right one. Hate speech is hate, and a crime against who ever is being undermined
__label__Support	Report comment buttons would make that comment flagged up to moderators and therfore removed quickly
__label__Position	By blocking rotten apples who spew hate speech immediately
__label__Position	there are people who go in the comment section just to argue and cause distress to other people commenting and that needs to be monitored and comments removed if necessary
__label__Position	Space on comments is a must have because many users get to participate into a good course that could help many others and therefore those spewing hate should be harshly dealt with. Blocked actively so
__label__Support	Agreed
__label__Position	A reporting site that is accessible across all platforms would be a good start like https://www.report-it.org.uk/reporting_internet_hate_crime.
__label__Support	I agree, there are currently no online hate speech statistics available due to a lack of means to report hate speech: https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/what-is-online-hate-crime/
__label__Position	https://master03.ou.bcause.app/distr#step-9
__label__Position	One user by the name of AndreaP said in order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section Newspapers should be one sided providers. I strongly disagree with this argument. It is very autocratic and happens a lot in countries where media and citizens does not have freedom and oppressed by harsh leadership. Comments in newspapers help many to get raw information from the ground and open minds of many to see issues differently from differing opinions. Indeed comments section are necessary
__label__Position	If comments section is removed because of dominating hate speech than another option should be provided to constructive users. An option to send opinion pieces and letters should be available
__label__Position	I maintain that rules and measures should be put in place to regulate users and resulting consequences too in order to keep newspaper comments section free of hate speech.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	Negative thought. I disagree. any effort will definitely make a difference. If hate speech is not monitored at all, racists and narcissistic people tend to grow and get away with so much
__label__Support	The only way hate speech can be combatted is through open debate. Any restrictions on speech by the newspaper have the implication it could restrict this open debate and allow those with hateful comments to become isolated and potentially commit violence if their views go unchallenged.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Attack	Good Argument but at the same time we must look at how it affect people live most people commit suised because of hate speech
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Support	Totally agree if there wasnt a box to comment it would stop a lot of this
__label__Attack	Disagree. I think that newspapers have always been allowed to 'sell' information, but news sites do so at their own risk by eliminating vast swaths of subscribers and advertisers. A good reliable newspaper is also the best long term business model
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	I agree that moderators should be responsible for what is posted to avoid hate speech and offensive comments.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	the thing is people always find a way to say those certain words.
__label__Position	More Admin and block buttons
__label__Support	I support this, moderation should be visible.
__label__Support	I think that is a very good idea
__label__Position	the newspapers should have an algorithm that can detect comments which go against the community guidelines and ban these accounts. Spam accounts should also be detected and banned if they do no contribute constructively to the newspapers.
__label__Position	I think certain people should be not allowed to share their opinions publicly because their only intention is to create hate and to upset people. Separately, society need to be educated on how to communicate via Social Media.
__label__Attack	the things is they might create fake accounts or have bots commenting on their behalf.
__label__Position	How do you propose this to be executed?
__label__Position	In order to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. Active communinty management and moderation is required. This helps keep people in line with the community guildelines.
__label__Position	I remain unconvinced that comments sections do more good than harm. According to https://socialmediapsychology.eu/2016/10/05/onlineandsocialmediacomments/, comments encourage extremism and there is a large (22%) amount of abusive language. Discourse should take place, but not anonymously in online comments sections
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted.

__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	In the same way that society needs to fight hate, the Internet needs to fight online hate.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Hate speech on newspaper websites reflects bad on the publication. Therefore, removing hate speech is quite essential.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Support	i agree. it is not a permanent solution
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Attack	Education about hate speech has been around and people still practice hate speech
__label__Attack	i believe that people know what is wrong and what is right. they do know when their comments are harmful
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Attack	I would like to be able to see why this comment was removed.
__label__Support	This is a measured, moderate response which looks to preserve the best of both worlds.
__label__Support	i agree with this completely
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Support	People buy papers knowing the paper's political stance. I read articles to understand a journalist's perspective.
__label__Position	Have someone moderate the comment section and flag or remove comments that meet the criteria for hate speech. It minimises the hate speech problem while not restricting users from commenting their opinion or forcing them to conform their view to the post.
__label__Position	There should be moderators of the discussion, people who use hate speech should be informed of what is problematic about their comments, comments should be deleted or they might be hidden but you can open them and read the moderators comments. If educating is not helping after first attempt, person should be restrcited form further discussion.
__label__Support	I like the idea of controversial opinions still being available to see other perspectives, but not being forced to see them if you don't want to.
__label__Position	an informed overview about hate speech before anyone can comment so that they can know what to comment and not to comment
__label__Position	i agree that removing comments about hate speech is not the way to go
__label__Support	It is definitely the way to go. We should not allow hate speech
__label__Position	i believe that to permanently reduce comments about hate speech, the space for readers comments has to be eliminated, otherwise we will never completely reduce hate speech unless the platform for that hate speech is permanently removed.
__label__Position	One way to reduce hate speech on the platform would be to counter-argue the persons non factual point with actual resource backed up facts. Facts are hard to dispute and bringing in emotion to an argument makes you look bad, whereas showing facts shuts down their opinion while educating them and everyone else in the comment section. Source for this: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/take-action/engage
__label__Position	Another way to reduce hate speech in comment sections without having to have someone manually checking each comment is to have AI or an algorithm use filters to filter out comments that have certain trigger words in them and remove them as soon as they are posted. This is not a fool proof method but it would certainly stop a lot of hate speech filtering in and it would negate having someone sit and monitor the comment section of each newspaper.

__label__Position	i believe what should be prioritized is the permanent removal of the comment section. i also believe that people do not need to learn further about hate speech. people already know which comments are harmful and which comments are not harmful which is why they keep throwing those comments every chance they get. i stand with the take of eliminating the platform to comment and that will solve the solution. or the comment section should have moderators who can approve comments before they are posted.
__label__Position	Recent political positions in the UK have lead to more fighting for 'free speech' and saying that it is ok to be offended - this is shown in a police news release (https://www.college.police.uk/article/protecting-freedom-expression-updated-guidance). I would disagree - offending people is unacceptable.
__label__Support	I agree. People should not stay silent through fear of someone taking offence at what they say. How can people figure out what their viewpoints are on things if they aren't allowed to ask questions are think aloud?
__label__Position	A lot of technologies have an interface which removes certain hate words/offensive words and I believe this should/could be implemented. Or somebody needs to me a moderator and monitor the comments perhap
__label__Position	We should not allow newspaper websites to be moderated as this will lead to censorship and bias. It is possible that the moderators will let their own believes and preferences influence the decisions that they make and that could mean that people are unfairly censored. Look at this study from Germany, for example: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793
__label__Position	We are on a slippery slope. Soon we won't have any privacy online whatsoever. We won't be able to express ourselves properly and won't be able to be anonymous. Is it really worth losing our privacy and our right to free speech just to avoid potentially offending some people? This issue has been being studied and written about for years now. Take a look at this Pew Research Center article from 2017: https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/03/29/the-future-of-free-speech-trolls-anonymity-and-fake-news-online/
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Attack	Hate speech should not be taken as a form of free speech
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	upholds freedom of speech
__label__Support	can help educate
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	less ideas generated
__label__Support	no hate speech!
__label__Attack	no opportunity to discuss topics
__label__Position	rules for discussion could be posted before giving the access, mention that chat moderators are following all discussions and hate speech will be removed if occures.
__label__Position	Drawing the line between Freedom of speech and hate speech is critical, strict moderation and being able to hold people accountable will ensure hate speech is low. Moderators will just need to act impartially.
__label__Support	You are right. it is the people who do not know, what they are taking about, they make problems
__label__Position	Strict moderation of comments prior to them being published may be the only way to limit hate speech on comments sections.
__label__Attack	Would this not limit freedom of speech then ? people wont truly speak their minds if its being filtered first. Moderators would be given too much power ?
__label__Position	Proper moderation by the website owner should be required, whether using human moderators or using technology to flag potential hate speech for human review and action.
__label__Attack	I agree and as stated in this article (https://www.impactplus.com/blog/no-comment-why-companies-continue-to-move-away-from-comment-sections-on-their-website) it is possible to see that some websites actually already deleted the comment sections. They turned out to be quite useless as mostly trolls were commenting, while no interesting discussions were there anymore.
__label__Position	I would not eliminate the hate speech right away but rather alarm the user and ask them to refrain from that kind of speech or ask them to elaborate or explain the reasons for the anger. Maybe as a moderator I would try to understand their viewpoint because by removing the speech there will be just more anger and hatred.
__label__Support	I agree. It's also a good way to give a second chance to a person in order for them to change their behavior. And maybe help them understand that they are writing hateful thing, and educating them in a sense.
__label__Position	Removing the comment section will only create a bigger revolt and uprise from people that write hate speech, and it will move to another media outlets. So the problem should be treated not silenced it. It is the responsibility of newspapers websites to police hate speech in order to create a safe environment for an healthy discussion about a news article. Otherwise you are cutting short an experience that users might want to have. So by censoring all the comment section your make erverybody pay a price for something that they haven't done. Moderation is the key and should be done my the newspapers websites according to the values they have.
__label__Position	Removing the comment section should not be an option, we should not lose the right to freedom of speech based on the likelihood that a few may post hateful comments, strict moderation and being able to report hate speech is the solution. Having people sign up for platforms and use ID to which they could be held personally accountable is an option as well. Hate Speech often comes from being able to hide behind a keyboard, screen and a fake username.
__label__Position	Although technology could help reduce hate speech, there are issues. For example, the program has to be written by a human who themselves may have a bias which influences what amounts to hate speech or not. This is raised in this artcle: https://deepsense.ai/artificial-intelligence-hate-speech/
__label__Position	Many children and teens don’t want to be a part of negative behavior like name-calling, criticizing, bullying, and cyberbullying. Dealing with haters isn’t that different from dealing with bullying and cyberbullying. Teens who feel overwhelmed by all the drama on social media will often unfriend or unfollow people online to disengage.
__label__Position	With so many people hiding behind their virtual persona to post hate speech, it makes it hard for the organisations that run comments sections. As the article linked to below shows, such people become ever more inventive in circumventing the algorithms so organisations will have to keep up. https://www.fastcompany.com/90539275/facebooks-ai-for-detecting-hate-speech-is-facing-its-biggest-challenge-yet
__label__Position	I think that comments sections should remain on websites, but that they should be heavily regulated. Filter words could be used to discourage and identify hate speech, but in addition I think there should be someone who monitors comments for misinformation and who will respond with information and links in order to correct misinformed commenters. Comments are great to help encourage reflection and other viewpoints, but they can be very damaging.
__label__Attack	not difficult, would say need more work and maybe more money spent in discovering something new
__label__Attack	being ban or warned has the first step
__label__Position	would not be right if we take away the comment section. We would be punishing people that didn't do anything or even are people trying to help others and this way would complete stop everyone from sharing ideas or even help others in need.
__label__Position	This link shows that in 2020 Facebook reported that exposure to hate speech was only 0.11% which I think is a pretty good argument for not putting a blanket ban on comments sections https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/what-is-online-hate-crime/
__label__Position	https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/what-is-online-hate-crime/ shows that the exposure to hate speech on one of the biggest websites (FB) was only 0.11%. Surely this shows that there shouldn't be an overall ban on comments sections? Monitoring must be working.
__label__Position	I think consistent and thorough moderation is the way forward with this. Any public forum requires a delicate balance of free speech and regulation though this seems to lean to the former at the moment - any Daily Mail article is evidence of this in particular. I do agree with a number of comments here, in that keeping commenting open allows for healthy discussion and learning opportunities, however, it is often the case that many comments left (particularly on sensitive or divisive topics) are irrelevant and are outright bullying.
__label__Position	Moderation should be taken perhaps slightly more seriously - and for websites like Metro and MailOnline this is done so through active moderation rather than technological triggers. This link: https://committees.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/25756/html/ shows a pretty coherent list of moderating activity for the DMG group and it is promising to see that particular stories (often of a sensitive nature or relating to criminal cases) are not open to receive comments on public forums. It is often forgotten that news outlets' primary intention is to inform - it is only in recent decades that the element of discourse has been implemented (at least easily and openly, outside of writing into a newspaper to voice an opinion).
__label__Position	The difficulty with moderation is that it is subjective - if done so via human moderation if there is no existing framework to follow particular viewpoints or comments may not be seen to be worthy of removing though for others this may not be the case. If moderating is done so by filtering words or with no human intervention, over-moderation is a risk. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2056305119832588
__label__Position	WEBSITES BREACH FREEDOM OF SPEECH by eliminating space for readers comments
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	Agreed with above. Comments are possible without being aggressive and it does allow people to talk about topical things.
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Support	There needs to be a strict line between 'Free speech' and 'Hate speech'.
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	how do you decide what is disrespecful?
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	Newspapers are read by various demographics and have different types of people from different angles reading different ones, so a comment section does seem like it shouldn't be necessary
__label__Position	The comments that people make could be reviewed by a machine that learns the difference between an opinion and hate speech which can determine what comments can be on newspaper sites
__label__Position	We could monitor responses, blacklisting offensive words and possibly having unbiased humans monitor it
__label__Position	By putting in a classing program that will read and class information as it enters. That way things will work nicely and we wont see more of hate speech
__label__Support	It will create faster moderation of content
__label__Position	hate speech cannot be fairly reduced. Either you moderate it and will remove what some deem to be unfairly some kind of speech or you don't moderate it and allow hate speech to exist on the platform.
__label__Position	I think removing space for comments is not the solution because how else will people discuss the matter at hand or share their opinion. I think hate speech should be set to be hidden from being viewed instread.
__label__Support	Hiding them could be a good idea as it allows a log of this person, and could even allow possible banning of people from the platform if they use it in a bad way
__label__Position	We need to be very clear about what constitutes hate speech and create severe punishments for those that spread it.
__label__Support	Punishments would be good but also a mixture of education and this could help. Hate speech is a very person-by-person thing, what some may think isn't, some may think is.
__label__Position	People will always spew hate speech and regulating it may be difficult to do. Freedom of speech should prevail therefore eliminating the comments section would be wrong. The newspaper site may have an automation that identifies hate words and whenever these appear the comment should be hidden from the comments section.
__label__Position	The problem with moderating means that people may have a stance on what counts as a hate comment and may cause differing opinions and deletions of stuff that may just be outside someone's comfort zone https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793
__label__Attack	I agree with the comment but the link provided is quite biased and one sided.
__label__Support	I agree that removing comments is not a good idea.
__label__Position	After having read other comments it is clear that an AI would also allow for faster moderation and removal of hate speech faster. Additionally, an AI would not be as bias as an individual may be, who would have their own ideas about what hate speech is and can be.
__label__Position	A good way of reducing hate speech on websites of newspapers is to program the AI so that it adheres to the laws of the country that the website belongs to. For example in the UK the AI that moderates comments could use the CPS (https://www.cps.gov.uk/crime-info/hate-crime) definition of hate crime to control the comments.
__label__Position	All comments would need to be vetted before being posted on the site.
__label__Position	Furthermore, AI should be trusted in this case, as there has been development in the past two years on AI being able to detect and counteract hate speech, as shown on Facebook etc. (https://ai.facebook.com/blog/ai-advances-to-better-detect-hate-speech/).
__label__Support	flagging comments would be an easier way
__label__Support	It will also prevent a lot of spam and hijacking of the threads. If there is no moderation it can become a place to spam hateful and non hateful speech https://turbofuture.com/internet/5-Reasons-Major-Sites-Should-Bring-Back-Comment-Sections
__label__Attack	Democracy dies in darkness. Commentary on news was made to spark debate and deeper thought about new events. I feel something is lost if we remove this feature from news articles.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Attack	readers should be able to have their say
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Attack	that's right, comments actually can give a lot useful information but also give all the wrong idea about particular article.
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Attack	Yes but not all people are intelligent or polite enough, many people really like to hate speech.
__label__Support	Hate speech must be controlled in some how.
__label__Support	be responsible of your words
__label__Attack	Who now gets to determine the criteria, and what is topping them from being bias?
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	I think one way of eliminating hate speech is to filter the comment section by certain words that are considered hateful. We obviously can not control what people do but by filtering the comment section we can limit what people can and can not say.
__label__Support	too many hate words
__label__Attack	The requirement of a phone number is a reasonable one, but might restrict participation (i.e. there will be people who are unable or unwilling to give their phone number just to comment on a newspaper website). An alternative approach could be to enforce a 'waiting time' from account creation to the ability to post comments? This would prevent repeat offenders from simply creating new accounts after they were banned
__label__Position	I believe we can fairly reduce hate speech by developing an algorithm to flag any potential "hate words" that may come up and then have an actaul member of staff thoroughly read the comment to determine if it was indeed hate speech or not. Also collecting indentification information can be crucial to hold the offenders responsible.
__label__Position	You can reduce hate speech by moderating the comments and content management.
__label__Attack	I have to agree with DamianC above, I notice a lot of hate speech on twitter for example and I feel this would if anything create more problems as they would have zero control over the platform.
__label__Attack	But some publishers are indeed deciding to pre-emptively remove comment sections, whether across the entire site or just for specific articles they expect to lead to problematic comment sections - see some of the links within https://digiday.com/media/comments-sections/
__label__Position	I believe that education and awareness around hate speech and how it affects it`s victims should be a priority.
__label__Attack	People are using hate speech in non sensitive articles too.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a problem that has let some people to even take their lives. finding a way to eliminate it is a good idea but eliminating the comment section does not sound to be a good idea as every story gets interesting with interaction. the comment section brings life to a story so we cannot afford not to have it. I would suggest filtering the comments and blocking those with hate speech.
__label__Position	100% with you on this one.
__label__Position	Comments are important as they allow other people to express their views but at the same time it can be a problem when we have to deal with inconsiderate individuals.
__label__Position	The lines between hate speech and freedom of speecg and expression and constantly getting blurred further and further.
__label__Position	I believe that hate speech comments should have flagged and removed buy moderators
__label__Position	having a way of screening and removing those comments will help.
__label__Position	by limiting the number of characters that can be used in the comments and flagging for words or phrases
__label__Position	Verify all persons that can comment on the reader's comment section, this way everyone can be responsible and not hide behind anonymity.
__label__Position	I notice that there is a contrast between education and punishment towards offenders. For example, BenedictN believes that punishment is the best way to deal with hate speech. However, AllisonK and LawrenceM believe that education is the best way to deal with hate speech. I propose that all users should be educated on creating a respectful and inclusive discussion before commenting, but if hate speech is detected, punitive measures should include further educational measures that encourage discussing respectfully instead of avoiding discussion.
__label__Position	One reader said its ok to eliminate the comment section, I do not agree with them because we need to hear other peoples views on the topic and it can only be done in the comment section.
__label__Position	I believe that we can educate people against posting hateful speech. without specific reference i believe education is the best way to combart this problem.
__label__Position	By having comments moderated so hate speech is screened out
__label__Position	Having read some opinions I believe maybe the best way is for everybody to be ID Verified, I do have some concerns however as this will make it difficult for those who can not afford ID to contribute and a solution for that would need solving first in my opinion.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	Automatically hiding comments flagged inappropriate may promote hate speech as well, as coordinated groups may flag comments to target and suppress the speech of specific people.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it.

__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Position	I can't see anyone else's comments to respond to them either.
__label__Position	Make sure that reports of hate speech are actually hateful and not just people being upset with no reason
__label__Position	The active reporting of hate speech and the website being accountable for curating said reports
__label__Position	A way to combat the root issue of hate speech is to educate people. On the newspaper site there could be resources to inform people of how harmful hate speech really is. We can also educate people on our differences and how to celebrate these rather than turn against eachother. https://www.stompoutbullying.org/blog/hate-speech
__label__Position	I think there should be a definitive dictionary of hate words that is agreed by a government official and used as a algorithm to determine whether a comment is hate, they could then build on this without removing peoples ability for freedom of speech
__label__Position	Require all comments to go through a censor first. can limit hate speech. https://www.netreputation.com/internet-censorship-pros-cons/
__label__Position	regulations and setting values is the most paramount phase to consider when planning to eliminate hate speech from newspapers websites which clearly state that should anyone go beyond these rules will then be held accountable .

__label__Position	Comment spaces enhances social participation
__label__Position	newspapers websites should be first be monitored before published to the public
__label__Position	i agree that hate spech blocking does not really help in many ways. the root cause is the behavioral problem that needs a changed. i completely agree not to have comments section in many forums
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Support	the writer will not feel disheartened
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Support	You are right -People have lost the ability to debate, and think that shouting the loudest wins the argument.
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	Standards are measurable and can be published
__label__Support	Always a question of who guards the guardians
__label__Support	I think that people should be given the opportunity to have free speech but with people who are paid to moderate comments. Free speech should also include people being given the opportunity to say things others do not agree with as long as it is not promoting a violent crime to be committed against someone.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Support	No one can be informed about the debate - just the newspapers view - which in and of itself will be from their point of view
__label__Position	I do not think it can ever be totally eliminated it will always be there but there can be reporting tools for hate sppech.
__label__Position	I don't think this can be done, if there is space for comments there will always be people who want to abuse it
__label__Attack	one-tone approach
__label__Position	There should be more moderators who can 'hide' offensive comments that can still be seen by the poster, as well as their contacts
__label__Support	It is nice to read things you agree with, and proabaly helps sell newspapers
__label__Position	i agree, freedom of speech is our right, as long as its presented in a respectful manner
__label__Position	automatically delete hateful comments
__label__Support	It is possible to use evidence based methods to apply this type of solution, then its a question of automationon
__label__Position	most people seem to be of the opinion that cutting comments altogether is not constructive. A good point was made by an individual that viewing opinions from people you like only doesn't help you to grow (echo chamber).
__label__Position	Large companies need to invest more money in having paiI td moderators to monitor hate speech on their articles. I think all speech excpet for speech inciting people to commit violence or murder should be allowed even if i so not agree with it. I think that to prevent hate sppech it will start with educating young people
__label__Attack	I feel this could lead to propagating false information through inclusion of poorly researched urls.
__label__Position	By having companies employing skilled and trained moderators.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Attack	Hate speech is a blurred line and comes in different forms based on factors such as geography.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Attack	I think comments provide additional context and a barometer for the reception of the article. Removing comments completely would be a shame!
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Support	I also don't think the removal of a comments section will make them take further, alternative action.
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	I agree that moderation would help in this case so everyone feels safe to share their opinion
__label__Position	monitor comments before the are posted
__label__Position	I think all comments should be moderated. Otherwise people can post things which are untrue and these comments are spread to other forums by people who don't realise they are untrue.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should leave their comment sections open to allow for feedback from their readers. Although, it is important for them to also pay attention to moderating divisive comments from other readers.
__label__Position	what is the point of comments if not all views are allowed to be expressed?
__label__Position	Against removinh space for readers comment section
__label__Position	People tend to comment just to rile others up, which means it will be a lot of work to moderate. Perhaps an all or nothing approach is best.
__label__Position	There is some evidence that when hate speech increases in comments sections there is a difference in the linguistics used. Perhaps it would be possible to use artificial intelligence to pick up on this quicker than a moderator could.
__label__Support	This is a good solution which would reduce burden on moderators, whilst also automating some of the process.
__label__Position	I don't think removing the comment section reduces hate speech per se, it just pushes it elsewhere. I can't help feeling this sort of censorship is an infringement on free speech.
__label__Attack	Why do people read comment sections? To get informed and enlightened or because they are nosy and killing time? I think most of the time is the latter. I am not sure the comments expressed at the bottom of a page bring more value to the conversation than they bring potential offence, hatred and fights started just for the fun of it.
__label__Support	I think this is a good point. I hadn't thought about moderator bias.
__label__Support	That is a great suggestion, that way, we all get to voice our opinions and the newspaper doesnt censor the views of their readers.
__label__Attack	You're trusting an algorithm that would need to be trained by humans - so the AI itself could still be biased.
__label__Attack	I agree over-censorship is a negative, but there are laws about hate speech that should be upheld.
__label__Position	Although my default position is against censorship of free speech, I have to agree with certain commentators here that the comments expressed at the end of articles rarely have anything enlightening to add to the article, mostly it's just a way for the man in the street to vent and feel their view is being heard. I'm sure most of us can empathise with the feeling of helpless and invisibility a lot of commentators express.
__label__Position	Another way of dealing with the hate speech without removing the comments section is by asking the moderator or admin to remove the comment once you as a reader see it. https://www.unia.be/en/areas-of-action/media-and-internet/internet/how-to-deal-with-hate-speech
__label__Position	https://constitutionallyspeaking.co.za/no-turning-of-news24-comments-is-not-a-form-of-censorship/
__label__Position	I agree with other posters that moderation is the answer. There should be dedicated resource within newspapers that look at comments being made, and removing those that breach guidelines. Guidelines should be publicly accessible. Comment should be closed after a pre-defined period of time to reduce burden on moderators.
__label__Position	No one is going to give significant personal data or information, or if they do it will false information. I think all comments should be moderated all the time, and posts removed if they contain harmful or damaging content.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.

__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.

__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Attack	The algorithm could be really bad at catching irony which can be really harmful as well.
__label__Support	Yes, the most easy way to make sure that people don't spread hate speech any further would be to educate people on the steps that should be done before posting any of your opinions. https://www.thecommentingclub.co.uk/sharing-your-opinion/
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	While yes we should all be able to communicate freely, with the anonymity of the internet internet trolls go too easily unpunished and their actions not removed

__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	There should be a right to free speech and peoples views
__label__Support	That people can write hate comments
__label__Attack	Continuing as normal.
__label__Position	The question is? Is hate speech not part of free speech? I think people should be left to express themselves however they feel is appropriate as long as they are not breaking an laws
__label__Support	This is one of the most sane posts in this discussion. Thank you.
__label__Position	The author of the post can moderate all comments before allowing them on the page. This does present the issue that only the author's views will be portrayed
__label__Attack	Moderator cannot always be reliable
__label__Attack	They may edit out valid non hateful comments that are just not their views
__label__Support	I agree blocking all comments blocks free speech
__label__Attack	Im not sure moderation would be the difinitive solution
__label__Position	I think we can have proactive crowd voting or send to moderator functions, to ensure a timely removal items could be hidden if several votes are received over time.
__label__Position	Short answer: you can't. 'Hate speech' is a vague term, and what one person considers 'hate speech' might not be the same as someone else's.
__label__Support	more online platform needs a moderator role, too often you see posts on social media that have rampant hate speech going unfiltered and the commenter going unpunished
__label__Attack	it should be fairly obvious what differentiates between an opinion and hate speech. Hate speech should be banned and removed
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.

__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.

__label__Attack	The irony was nice, but for the debate it confuses more than clarifies ideas. So your opinion was a hate speech? If it was, should it be here? Otherwise, why it was removed?
__label__Support	Hi Fabio, I believe you are absolutely right. Comments should definitely be allowed but under some kind of regulation. Not all comments are useful or relevant.

__label__Position	I mean it is hard to find a solution for this matter, some people will say that you are taking there free speech away and some might say that you are not doing anything to solve this matter. In my opinion, I am for free speech and freedom but when your free speech and freedom are used to attack me then you are attacking my freedom too, and with that you destroyed the thing that you stand for and defend.
__label__Position	Removing hate speech comments is the solution to go to, if you attacked me then you didn't respect my freedom.
__label__Position	But education and training and awareness are also needed, so people don't repeat what mistakes they have done in the past.
__label__Support	I totally agree with you. Adding that the comment section must remain closed until the education of the people takes effect. Remembering that the learning process takes time to complete.
__label__Position	education is the solution
__label__Attack	Newspapers and the media have a big role to play, but so do others
__label__Position	Moderators approving posts before being public would be ideal, but expensive
__label__Support	I agree that removing anonymity online can help to moderate behaviour. With anonymity online users lose their inhibitions and can be more extreme as shown in this article https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Noam-Lapidot-Lefler/publication/220495001_Effects_of_anonymity_invisibility_and_lack_of_eye-contact_on_toxic_online_disinhibition/links/5f9590ce92851c14bce5ae0c/Effects-of-anonymity-invisibility-and-lack-of-eye-contact-on-toxic-online-disinhibition.pdf
__label__Position	Fact Checking may be a better solution than moderation that censors posters of fake news or hate speech. Research shows that censorship can serve to cement the posters conspiracy views (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304422X19301159). A 'fact checked' type flag could be helpful instead.
__label__Position	I think that comments at least need to be vetted so that when someone gives an opinion that is valid it can be posted but invalid, aggressive, nonsensical comments get filtered out.

__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Support	I don't think removing the comment spaceis a good idea, people should still be given a platform where they can voice themselves out. Having a team look through the comments and find those that include hate speach and remove them and maybe ban the people whith hatespeach comments from ever posting comments again.

__label__Position	Eliminating the comments section will reduce engagement and the sense of having a dialogue / encouraging free speech in the publication, which would be detrimental to the newspaper. Having comment moderation, in moderation (no pun intended!) would probably be the best way forward. https://ethicaljournalismnetwork.org/online-comment-moderation-emerging-best-practices
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Support	That is an interesting point. It would need to be an impartial party. I know sometimes FB and other social media platforms use algorithms to hide certain posts (usually due to language) so maybe that could be one answer?
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Attack	I overall agree. But, newspaper comment sections are very public and mainstream. Allowing hate speech on such places makes it seem less taboo, and more allowed. These aren't the kinds of ideas we want people to think are 'ok'.
__label__Attack	Don't think we should be censoring people
__label__Support	Stops the bullying and people feeling bad
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	We need to hold websites and social media platforms responsible for hate speech. This is especially important for large platforms with significant influence (e.g., twitter, youtube, facebook).
__label__Position	Discussion can be encouraged, but so often it leads to hate speech / one sided arguments. There needs to be a moderator in place to delete / hide certain comments, so free speech is allowed, but hate speech is not.
__label__Attack	Honest
__label__Support	I think the only way to stop this would be to review all comments before they are published and delete anything that is hate speech.
__label__Support	This would reduce hate speech and overall help to ensure a promote positive environment
__label__Position	While it may be silencing people's freedom of speech I still think it is appropriate to remove hate speech. There are other ways to express opinions without attacking another person personally.
__label__Position	Have a set of criteria for what counts as 'hate speech', and place the onus upon individual publishers to crack down on eliminating this speech
__label__Attack	Anonymity may also prevent people to explore ideas they feel are taboo and prevent them from seeking help. e.g. addiction, some LGBTQ+ issues that are taboo in certain cultures etc.
__label__Position	This article made me reflect on the definition of hate speech and I aggree with blocking comments that go against a persons protected characteristics - if a comment like that is made, it should instantly be banned from the platform / comment section. https://about.fb.com/news/2017/06/hard-questions-hate-speech/
__label__Attack	I think the writer can decide
__label__Support	There is laws against discrimination and so should be upheld

__label__Position	I definately think the way forward is to have moderators that will review all comments before they get posted.They can then approve or disapprove all the comments and flag inappropiate user names. Yiou could also add a way for the readers to flag inappropiate comments and these will also flag to the moderators.
__label__Attack	Moderator bias
__label__Support	Reduces the amount of troll comments
__label__Attack	Slows down discussion.
__label__Position	This is an interesting article on the outcomes of several news agencies that disabled the comments section. Some of the writers of articles were getting subjected to abusive messages. This would be another argument for verified profiles only allowed to access the websites with their real names and details.
__label__Support	Reducing scam/spam profiles, or profiles just intended for hate speech protects vulnerable people.
__label__Support	Anonymity empowers people and might make them more willing to express extreme opinions. Verified profiles reduces anonymity.
__label__Position	https://www.niemanlab.org/2015/09/what-happened-after-7-news-sites-got-rid-of-reader-comments/
__label__Position	Alongside moderators and verification of profiles, I think offensive language should be immediately recognised by the system and disallow users from posting and/or move their comment to a 'moderator' section to double check the context first.
__label__Position	Whilst I am pro keeping comments (with appropriate mods), to look at the arguments against: Removing comment sections allows the focus to be on the article, and if individuals still want to voice their opinion on it, they can still do so on another media platforms which allows the free speech. This 'extra step' may discourage troll users from leaving hate as 1) they are not as visible/cannot make as much of an impact on another platform and 2) interfaces such as Twitter and Facebook have their own moderation techniques.
__label__Position	Hate speech online requires different strategies for different platforms. Facebook vs. newspapers. Youtube vs. LinkedIn. Twitter vs. a specialised forum etc. All have different userbases and customs/habits that those users are accustomed too. There's no 'one size fits all' fix. We have to think specifically about newspaper websites - who's using them, how are they accessing them, what sorts of comments are the ones cropping up the most.

__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted.

__label__Support	Don't delete the comment section, at some point you will realise that some criticism are inconsequential
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Attack	I agree as it would feel very weird to not have comment sections
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions

__label__Attack	Cant be onesided as thats too bias, balanced viewpoint is better
__label__Position	I think having a filtering system to block certain hateful words could help and moderation of comments/report systems.
__label__Support	I completely agree, everyone should have the chance to give an opinion and also agree or disagree with the points in an article, however there is no room for hate speech. The best way to achieve an ability to comment on online newspaper articles and websites is to allow free speech but to regulate comments so as to avoid nasty hate speech, people then making such hateful comments could then be blocked from further comments.
__label__Position	By having stricter controls over who can sign up to the comments and blocking them from the sites when they use hate speech. It's unfortunate that it happens, but sometimes they are loud just to get attention. Starve them of it.
__label__Position	Having moderators remove hateful speech and providing better education.
__label__Position	Hate speech could be reduced by having word filters and hiring moderators that stick to specific guidelines and giving users warnings about their behavior
__label__Position	Hate speech could be reduced by having word filters and hiring moderators that stick to specific guidelines and giving users warnings about their behavior
__label__Position	I think this is a good idea and suggest similar ideas.
__label__Position	By implimenting a system whereby people who use hate speech can be held accountable
__label__Position	There should be some kinda strict word filtering systems with hired moderators that look through comment to identify potentially or offensive content, and also giving users clear guidance on whats permitted and whats not permitted
__label__Position	We can reduce hate speech by educating people of the dangers of hate speech on platforms like websites and newspapers.
__label__Position	I do agree with this, especially the screening by charities or organisations, but I would add unbiased independents (as long as they were competent).
__label__Position	We can reduce hate speech by holding the owner of the platform accountable for hate speech being on their platform, this will force the platform owners to put strict systems in place to ensure this does not occur.
__label__Position	We can reduce hate speech by holding the owner of the platform accountable for hate speech being on their platform, this will force the platform owners to put strict systems in place to ensure this does not occur.
__label__Support	I like this idea as it contains inbuilt responsibility, so it motivates the people in power to fix it, and competition between different newspapers will breed more effective methods to reduce hate speech effectively, which other platforms will copy and adapt
__label__Position	I agree with this.
__label__Position	I also think the concept of Counterspeech to reduce the impact of hate speech could be beneficial.https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/counterspeech-better-way-tackling-online-hate
__label__Position	Freedom of speech is possible without using hate speech. Hate speech should be regulated as it can constitute a crime. The problem with online comment space is that people commenting aren't accountable for what they write. So, unless there is a system where ID is used to set up an account to make comments, then the best solution is to allow comments but to regulate it, moderate it and ensure there are filters so that comments exhibiting racist, homophobic, misogynistic, etc language is removed and the person trying to post such comments are blocked from future commenting.
__label__Position	It's also useful to identify what constitutes hate speech as what one person finds hateful, another may not. Understanding why certain speech is deemed hateful by the vast majority is also a useful tool in this discussion. https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech

__label__Support	While this would eliminate all hate speech, newspapers would not implement it, as the interaction drives hits on their site, so the comments section is an essential part of spreading the news person to person
__label__Attack	This will cause readers not to engage with the website or newspapers

__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Removing all comments as a blanket measure is appropriate as it moves the conversations to other spaces. Newspapers should be for news, objective, they are no place for opinions
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Attack	An algorithm in itself can be bias and discrimatory as proven by studies, it also may not take into consideration different languages
__label__Support	I agree, we cannot compromise free speech, we need to find a way to allow free speech whilst targeting the removal of hate speech
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.

__label__Attack	Restricts free speech
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Support	Good. As long as it wasn't reported and the opinion was well written.
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Support	this can also be dealt with by having moderators who can filter fake news out/highlight the correct facts and refer to more up to date stories if relevant
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	Some people could cloud hate speech as 'open mindedness' and use it as a way to push their agenda without taking responsibility.
__label__Support	Removes pointless hate speech
__label__Attack	different people will have different interpretations of 'disrespectful'
__label__Support	People are entitled to an opinion that isn't hateful or intended to harm a person.
__label__Support	Sometimes being truthful can mean being harsh, but for the greater good.
__label__Attack	I believe everyone has a different threshold to how much hate speech they can handle. Some might take offence to things that others may not.
__label__Support	accountability by inputting details is a good solution
__label__Attack	Some would argue it removes their right of freedom of speech. Despite whether it is of hateful intent or not.
__label__Support	While I agree that we're all entitled to an opinion, I think it's important we understand the difference between hateful comments that are for hurtful purposes rather than an opinion that does not generate more hate
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	Discussion will always happen. This would encourage discussion to happen elsewhere in forums without direct reference to the news article or without any moderation. It also pushes discussion into social media platforms where discussion tends to be more polarised and less productive.
__label__Attack	I don't know. We still need thoughts and to allow people to comment incase the article is written wrong or is not sending the correct message out
__label__Support	I understand that not everyone can be trusted to enforce a well respected community of readers and therefore we should rid that oppurtunity due to previous incidents regarding hate speech.
__label__Support	but the amount of comments is what puts too much of a strain on moderators
__label__Attack	Hate comments can manifest into something much worse and is absolutely neccesary to destroy the source of the hate.
__label__Support	yes. good moderators are the key
__label__Support	yes. good moderators are the key
__label__Support	yes. good moderators are the key
__label__Position	not all stories need people to add their opinions sothat should ease the pressure on moderators
__label__Attack	People will add their opinions anyway, whether they are necessary or not
__label__Position	I tend to agree that newspapers should provide spaces for dicussion. It encourages people to read about the topic before making comments and peopel can easily reference reference the article in their comments. I think this allows for a more fruitful and productive discussion that on other platforms e.g. social media. However, hate speech is certainly an issue and easily derails conversations. While moderation of hate speech would be ideal, the burden on the newspaper is likely too great to do this manually. Perhaps a mixture of auto-moderation (flagging/removing key words), manual review by the newspaper and some form of community moderation may work well together.
__label__Position	I feel that people should be allowed to have freedom of expression online but should be held accountable for vitriolic and unbased hate speech, this could be achieved by proving identity and by using citations and references when posting online
__label__Support	online verification can create a more personal and tangible online persona in whch people feel accounatable and scrutinised
__label__Attack	passing legislation on free speech is difficult especially in countries with entrenched codified constitutions
__label__Support	This is a good idea, as it eliminates the need for a moderator to sift through every single comment but rather they only need to look through comments that have triggered the bot. Then, they can make a decision on whether it has truly conveyed hate speech or whether (less likely scenario) there is human/bot error in the process
__label__Attack	While I agree, there are many ways in which these auto-moderation technologies can be bypassed. https://newmediaservices.com.au/9-ways-to-bypass-auto-moderation/
__label__Position	up to this point, moderators have done a poor job as evidenced by the amount of hate speech so maybe the answer is simply to remove the ability to comment.
__label__Support	I agree. Considering much of this hate speech comes from bots it is impossible to keep up with it. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20563051221104749
__label__Position	You have to log on to write a comment, having character/post limits, comments must be verified by someone who checks for hate speech before approving the comment for publication
__label__Position	It's important that we remain a democratic society with acceptance of free speech, however it is a tricky balance between allowing free speech and the moderation of speech to prevent hate speech. I believe newspapers should be allowing comment sections, however it will be their responsibility to monitor this, and the social media website's responsibilities to monitor this on their platforms as well. How they choose to do this will depend on cost/staffing availability/bot technology, however it is an important action to take to prevent hate speech.
__label__Position	by having a moderator to manage the comments and a reporting system for people to use for any comments that contain for example hate speech. many social media groups now very effectively run these things and have spaces for all to discuss things in a respectful way. this works because there is a system to block troll commentators though and so a sign up system that allows moderators to monitor comment content would be necessary
__label__Position	Although free speech is important, this paper highlights the difficulties and tension of balancing the expression of ideas and healthy debate with the legal and moral ramifications of allowing hate speech.
__label__Position	Newspapers will be commented on in other spheres anyway. by separating this from the newspaper site itself this allows for almost anything to be said on the matter (depending on the controls in those spheres). The advantage to allowing a comments section on the site itself but also moderated and with a reporting system in place, allows for any misdirects or fake news that may pop up in the comments to be directly addressed along side the article and will allow peoples views and voices to be heard
__label__Position	hate speech moderation can also be difficult and will require intelligent human response rather than relying solely on the use of AI https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Attack	infringing on free speech
__label__Support	means that people can read read articles without bias or preconceived opinions
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Support	This would also encourage others to speak up more without sounding hateful.
__label__Attack	would require more than 1 moderator
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, feelings should be left out when giving your views.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Attack	The newspapers will not get to know how people realy feel about the issue at hand if the comment space is closed. The dialogue will be one sided
__label__Support	It can be useful for readers to see readers comments as they may present another interesting opinion or be informative in some way.
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Support	Think it may reduce misinformation from the newspapers if they are held accountable for what they say and the public dispute these given facts if they are not entirely correct
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	However it might not stop some people as they could believe that their opinion is correct and not hate.
__label__Support	That sounds good because then people know they will be held accountable for their comments.
__label__Attack	Requiring people to give a lot of information about themselves in order to give their opinion online is NOT a direction we should be going in. Moderators are fine; requiring people to dox themselves so they can be educated is not it.
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	In order for effective moderation to occur, some kind of consensus or clearly reachable policy on what constitutes hate speech (including dogwhistling, which may be less clear to a lay viewer) would need to be in place. This might require too much buy-in from commenters, but is necessary if anything can be consistently enforced.
__label__Attack	Being able to keep comments open is not a justification or a refutation of the presence of hate speech.
__label__Position	I always find it frustrating when a newspaper or other online media doesn't have a comments section. It just cuts you off from your audience. Hire somebody or somebodies to moderate. That's all you need to do. It's not rocket science.
__label__Position	It is important to understand what hate speech actually is. Attached is an example of what may be construed as hate speech, but it is only through a shared understanding of what hate speech is that it can start to be tackled. Effective moderation to agreed guidelines is the key.
__label__Position	Agreeing with others here: a standard of moderation would have to be communicated to the user, with straightforward policies of flagging or reporting potentially hateful comments. A synthesis of live and algorithmic moderators might be best, as certain words can be auto-flagged for review, whereas other things might involve a more delicate touch.
__label__Position	Moderation is necessary. Closing comments is not the answer, as communication can help people to understand each other's viewpoints. If you take comments away because you're afraid of hate speech, you're going to be creating a barrier between you and your audience.
__label__Attack	However a view point can be expressed appropriately as a constructive criticism by the target audience. Therefore you could argue that anyone who engages in hate speech is the wrong audience.
__label__Support	I do agree that comments shouldn't be closed.
__label__Support	Agreed, more understanding and education are always good for society. Moderation functions as a good intermediary for discussion.
__label__Position	Having a heavy hand in removing hate speech could backfire and reinforce certain readers' skewed worldviews. A study published on Science Direct (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304422X19301159) says that censorship of online comments can confirm commenters' conspiratorial views. Hate speech can lead to real life violence, but you have to go about moderation carefully.
__label__Position	I agree that you have to assess moderation carefully, as not to ruin democracy
__label__Position	Unless the comments encourages acts of crime on people and animals then it's not hate speech, it's you are a moderator and you censor certain comments because hew they make you feel then you are unfit for the job.
__label__Position	I think it'll be hard to do so, because everyone has the right to freedom of speech, but unless the comments brings acts of violence on people then it must be deleted
__label__Attack	Discriminatory words could be automatically blocked which will certainly reduce hate speech to some extent
__label__Position	I think through fair moderation, then the amount of hate speech will be reduced.
__label__Attack	However, there are often ways to get around automatic moderation, and manually completed moderation would use a large amount of man hours and money
__label__Attack	Think it is important to some extent to maintain free speech without heavy moderation from these newspapers who may be trying to sway opinions a certain way.
__label__Position	Aswell as moderation could potentially block people who have written hate speech or unsavoury language on these articles.
__label__Support	This would be very helpful
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	The issue at hand is not the total elimination of hate speech, but whether it can be reduced on newspaper websites. A newspaper must responsibly manage its public platform, and giving platform to hate speech is a problem it can manage. A newspaper is, by definition, not a forum.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Attack	We should all think before we comment freedom of speech does come with responsibilities
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Attack	When people are given choice to comment, trolls will come out naturally and therefore so will hate speech. You can only educate those willing to be educated.
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Support	This makes a good point. I think people should have freedome of speech but I also do think websites need to monitor comments.
__label__Support	I agree with this statement. All hate speech can be removed if being monitored properly.
__label__Support	I think moderators are essential for this job to ensure standards are maintained. For some people comment boards and threads may be their only available way to have their opinion heard. However that shouldn't allow for hate speech to be publicly viewed.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	I think people having to give personal data will make people think before they post hate speech or negative comments.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If newspapers did not allow interaction and went back to old school 1 way news, they would die out, nobody uses that anynore
__label__Position	It is a tricky one to get the balance correct. There will always be some people in society who are happy to spout nonsense/hatred online as they sit behind a keyboard. At the same time, there will also be people who wish to share their more sensible and respectful views on topics.
__label__Position	Flag up hate comments.
__label__Attack	this then gives them the attention they crave and publicises what they are saying
__label__Position	You can reduce hate speech from newspapers websites by having it properly monitored. Any hate speach written gets automatically removed.
__label__Attack	who gets to jugde what is allowed and whats not.
__label__Position	I agree with this and think more education is needed.
__label__Position	improvung people's education
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, and it is all of our jobs to try to stop it.
__label__Position	freedom speech is good but it assumes that common sense prevails too
__label__Attack	there is no common sense with hate speech so it cant be classed as free speech
__label__Attack	Education to try and find the root causes as to why the specific hate speech is rooted in some peoples minds
__label__Position	Allowing other members to flag comments for you could be very helpful as it cuts down on having moderators soft through everything. Good people usually are very helpful in flagging up hate speech.
__label__Support	Moderators who follow specific guidelines so that they are all consistent would be the best option to eleiminate bias
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	If you eliminate comments completely you both take away the right to free speech and inhibit the ability to have an open discussion about what constitutes hateful and offensive comments
__label__Attack	Freedom of speech should never be taken away.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Position	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.

__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	I suppose the problem here is what a person says is their version of "free speech" could easily be seen in a different context by a reader. It's a very difficult issue to get right.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	Algorithms can't be depended on. They will likely hold the bias of the creator or can't be smart enough to be reliable sources of end of for comment removal.
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	Can be misunderstood
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Support	I agree, what's the line between hate speech or just having a differing opinion
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Support	Reduces clear violations
__label__Attack	Free speech is a thing
__label__Position	People should be allowed to comment
__label__Position	Bringing a solution based on advanced machine learning which could automatically detect hate speech and disable comment function only for articles leading to commenters using hate speech.
__label__Position	I agree with the notion that being able to share our thoughts and feelings is a right and having people share their views can help people to question their own thoughts. The inclusion of moderators to prevent people from posting discriminatory or harmful comments would be good, but difficult to ensure these moderators aren't biased towards one argument
__label__Support	Also difficult to ensure that humans won't make mistakes and overcensor
__label__Position	I stand by my position of a moderator system
__label__Support	I would agree that a moderator system would be a better choice than removing the comments.
__label__Position	To be honest, I am torn, I think that good newspapers (good referring to the quality of their investigating and reporting) should not need a comment section. They should report the facts and as such, comments I feel are not needed, the goal is to provide information and comments are mostly opinions. What is the goal of the comments?
__label__Position	What if the website somehow blocks words which are hateful or discriminatory from their comment section
__label__Support	Social media companies are already using AI to do this and news platform should approach it in the same way - https://www.newsy.com/stories/artificial-intelligence-is-used-to-track-down-hate-speech/
__label__Position	I think this will affect free speech but I also agree that the option to comment on newspaper articles should be removed until a better solution can be found. Hate speech is serious and I believe the newspaper websites wouldn't remove the ability to comment unless they had no other choice. I agree with someone elses post that maybe having moderators in the comment sections would be a great start to ending hate speech.
__label__Position	I would almost agree that removing the comments would be beneficial. I've very rarely seen a comment on an article that actually contributed towards learning more about the content. It's typically just people yelling they don't agree without any true thought.
__label__Position	Whatever the decision may be, the law and freedom of speech needs to be considered
__label__Attack	It's extremely hard to draw the line. Surely someone being extremely harmful and discriminatory can just claim 'well it's free speech' ?
__label__Position	I don't believe that removing the comment section would reduce free speech at all. It's not removing your ability to talk about the article on a forum or with friends/family. I feel as though it's just removing it from an area where it is usually found in abundance. I can't begin to count how many times an articles comment section just turns into people spewing hate speech because they disagree with the content.
__label__Attack	I don't think this is about negative and positive comments but limiting someones ability to spread hate speech.
__label__Position	This evidence suggests steps can be taken to reduce hate crime, and maybe websites should take this into account, as Romania, which does not have these models in place, have higher hate crime online. However, how do we know this isn't just a cultural difference, rather than the efficacy of reducing hate crime in other countries?
__label__Position	There are already laws in place around removal of free speech to control hate speech. "Canadian courts have made it clear that reasonable limits can be placed on our freedom of expression in order to deal with hate" https://lop.parl.ca/sites/PublicWebsite/default/en_CA/ResearchPublications/201825E#:~:text=Canadian%20courts%20have%20made%20it,measures%20that%20protect%20free%20expression.
__label__Position	The use of the comments section is mainly to engage readers, but may be obsolete, and is there because it has always been there.....we should re evaluate its usefulness
__label__Position	Research shows that letting comments proliferate with little oversight is a “dangerous recipe,” Andincivility and negative comments can have a long-term impact. Certain commenting software use algorithms meant to flag problematic comments, but machines can only do so much. Should newspapers really be spending already depleted resources on monitoring comments?

__label__Position	Do not allow comments, they are unnecessary. Discussion should occur on other public forums. We don't conduct discussions by writing on a newspaper and leaving it on a train for other poeple to write their comments on it.
__label__Position	No-one should have to spend their time filtering out the disgusting things human beings are capable of saying about each other. Nobody has a right to comment on anything.
__label__Support	If you disagree with how they run their websites, run your own website.
__label__Support	every online space should have moderation its weird that this is even a discussion
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.

__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Position	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Support	Agreed! Probably can never get rid of it completely but taking steps to reducing it is 100% needed!
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Attack	I partially disagree - perhaps 'aggressive' is too harsh a word for what I am trying to convey but newspapers have to take action here, and in some cases it needs to be very severe action. Example here with the Washington Post: https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/04/21/comments-are-making-the-internet-worse-so-i-got-rid-of-them/, who say: "Comments are making the internet worse. So we got rid of them."
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Agreed, it's totally problematic once you start to censor opinion over simply bad language and obvious hate speech.
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Support	I agree, and this can be further enocouraged if the writerr or journalist engages with the comments that are being made on their story
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Attack	Great! I have a similar approach
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	how do we mute these comments? Cencorship?
__label__Support	I agree muting certain offensive words can have an impact on how much hate speech gets through on the website
__label__Position	More moderators would be the simplest strategy for reducing hate speech but there will still be a period of time where the hate speech is live on the website before being taken down. Using report buttons on newspaper websites can help the moderator identify the hate speech faster.
__label__Position	Admins!!
__label__Position	MAYBE JUST REMOOVE SOME PARTS THAT PEOPLE DONT NEED TO SEE AND ADD IT THERE IN ITS PLACE
__label__Position	By taking out some sections that people find disinteresting and replace it with something interesting.
__label__Attack	people will make will still use the smaller section for hate speech
__label__Support	it feels right
__label__Position	Not only hate speech but also internalized stereotypes has awful effect on online discussions: Please check this article. Moderation is a great idea as informed mods can decrease both hate speech and internalized stereotypes in the comments: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-018-0941-5
__label__Position	IT IS IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE WHO READ NEWSPAPERS TO FEEL SAFE AND FREE WHEN THEY READ NEWSPAPERS.SOME WEBSITES OR NEWSPAPERS DONT ALLOW PEOPLE TO VOICE OUT THEIR FEELINGS OR COMMENTS AND THAT SHOULD BE IMPROVED.
__label__Position	Although not specific to newspaper websites, this article shows that hate crime online has increased by over 200 incidents just from 2015 to 2018 so if the trend continues it is thought that this may now have increased to over 500 anti-sematism online incidents. https://www.turing.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2019-11/online_abuse_prevalence_full_24.11.2019_-_formatted_0.pdf
__label__Position	I think most people are reasonable and will consider others' feelings and stand points before they post, at least to some extent. The people we need to worry about are those who just post their opinions without any thought or care for others who may be offended or even attacked by their post. These people are very hard to control as they want to be entitled to their 'freedom of speech', regardless of who it may offend or upset. On the other hand, restricting what people want to say is dodgy territory and we run the risk of entering into murky waters of what can be controlled by 'the powers that be'. If we let them control what we say, we're only half a step away from letting them control what we do...which arguably we already let them do in 2020 with the covid lockdowns etc. On reflection I therefore think that newspapers should have filters set up in their comments sections that automatically block hate speech (this can be pre-identified words and phrases). This way, people wanting to cause trouble by posting hate speech won't be able to do so on the newspapers' websites. I also agree with previous commenters who have suggested making the comments section a little harder to find, which will put off some of the troublemakers and also hide any sensitive comments from those not wishing to read any of the comments. I've been on a bit of a ramble here but I hope this all makes sense!
__label__Position	My position as a reader and my argument is that bases on the rules of speech people have freedom of speech and expression. That should be done in a proper way without insulting others or hating or being racist in your speech. Websites and newspapers should not remove the comments of the people responding to hate speech. This is done according to the rules found in the following article: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230
__label__Attack	I don't think we will ever fully get rid of hate speech on these platforms unfortunately however more close monitoring could decrease it, as well as sanctions for those who write the hate speech.
__label__Position	In such a technolgical advanced world, we are not going to get rid of these comment sections that are on online newspaper articles. They provide a place were people can discuss their opinions and have debates. However, there is a minority of people who use those spaces to preach hate speech and this is an ongoing and increasing issue.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Support	Newspapers do not want to face critism by removing comments column, unfair society
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	It might lead to fake profiles
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Attack	The problem is establishing standards can be quite subjective and cause users to complain about censorship...
__label__Support	I agree there must be standards. Good point made there.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	It allows racist views to be challenged
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	Have a moderator than overlooks all readers comments and makes sure they're all suitable.
__label__Attack	Some views use coded racist language. Eg gypsies are often described using disguised phrases
__label__Support	will encourage dialogue
__label__Position	Have an automated word elimination that will detect words that promote hate speech and not allow them to be posted.
__label__Position	While hate speech and offensive language are quite difficult concetpts to pin down, there are topics which are considered by law such as recism, xenophobia, anti-semitism, etc. Some form of moderation could start there.
__label__Support	Not allowing anonymous posts will turn off individuals from commenting, that's limiting the ideas that others could have contributed
__label__Position	Not allowing anonymous posts as well would force individuals to process comments internally before publishing on a public platform.
__label__Support	Posting anonymously is not good. We should all be accountable to the website providers who have a duty to monitor their sites and act upon racist homophobe etc
__label__Position	Be more strict when allowing people to create profiles, that require identification before allowing anybody to comment. If they choose to be anonymous do not allow them to comment.
__label__Position	Websites need to be held accounbtable for hate speech
__label__Position	Our freedom to do anything as part of a society is limited. Thus freedom of speech should be no different. Poeple need to be held accountable for their mistakes, so everybody else's rights will be protected. So having a set of keywords which are not allowed to be used is a way of reminding the writter that using the offensive word he/she is trying to use is considered a crime. An additional way to handle that is having the flag option by users and a team of moderators who follow a standard and will verify if flagged comments should be maintained or not. Lastly, anonymity might bring a feeling of impunity and even its possibility, so a way to avoid that is allowing one profile per person/email, where a fake username can be set, but, in the backstage, the website will know who it is that wrote each comment.
__label__Position	Allowing people who have profiles with the website to comment. Anonymity should not be allowed. Information that is traceable to an individual could be implemented(even though may be intrusive) could be requested when creating a profile. Examples, a cellphone number that is FICAd , student number, loyalty card number and the like.
__label__Support	Would make people think before posting
__label__Attack	Spam calls
__label__Position	Perhaps vetting people more thoroughly would be a solution?
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Attack	The hate speech will go underground and may appear in other closed forums or whatsapp groups.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Having an open platform allows racists to have a forum to vent
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.

__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Support	agree with this! Lack of education is often the biggest culprits when it comes to hate speech - many people are scared of things they don't know about.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	If there is not a comment section, writers will not know how the reader feels about the article.
__label__Support	No hate speech will be written
__label__Position	Having comments be reviewed before they get posted would help - if the newspaper doesn't have enough resources to have someone manually review all comments, then some kind of automated solution filtering out certain keywords could be implemented.
__label__Position	Have a system that flags hate speech slurs, and then have a person or system review those comments and either allow them or remove them
__label__Position	I don't think it's helpful to cancel the comment space completely, we should have the ability to post our thoughts.
__label__Support	This is a good way to monitor comments
__label__Position	I think there should be a comment section so that writers know what the readers like and dislike but hate speech should be fully eliminated and any users using hate speech should be blocked for a period of time.
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Attack	This would create issues of illegibility and would only create more confusion as to the user's intent when the comment was made.
__label__Position	Blocking words does not stop hate, what we need to do is have a filter that alerts a human so that a post. Posts/users should be identifiable to the platform they post on (not identifiable to the post but to the platform should any hate crime be identified)

__label__Position	screen it before it gets posted, hire more people, they need more jobs available anyway
__label__Position	to reduce hate speech it is important to raise the stakes of what happens if you are caught. scientific evidence and criminological theory shows that if someone perceives greater risk in their actions, they are more likely to desist.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted.

__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	That will just give newspaper websites the opportunity to publish fake news without anyone challenging them (https://en.unesco.org/sites/default/files/journalism_fake_news_disinformation_print_friendly_0.pdf). for example, if they post fake news about covid, no one will challenge them and anyone who doesn't have enough information will believe what the article says.

__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Attack	The whole point of comment sections is so that people can provide their opinion on what they've seen/read, stopping this only minimizes debate and being able to view differing opinions. This then leads to break off groups choosing to use other platforms and thus having platforms with polar opinions which can be dangerous as people could be exposed to only one viewpoint

__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	People should be allowed to express their opinions as long as they are done so respectfully
__label__Position	By blocking comments with offensive words related to the topic, and banning individuals who constantly engage in hate speech.
__label__Position	Reducing hate speech needs to be a priority. We need to teach people how to express their opinions effectively without reverting to hate speech, we need to educate on the extent of the hurt hate speech brings and the trauma it is often derived from. Education is key and allows people to debate and disagree with respect, those who cannot do this should be removed or monitored from sites
__label__Position	By simply educating people about what harm hate speech can do to a person
__label__Attack	Trolls don't really care about anything but trolling so trying to reason with them is futile.
__label__Attack	People who are spreading hate speech usually won't care for being educated
__label__Position	filter out widely used hate speech phrases by pre-establishing those words in the back end and also by using moderators
__label__Position	I think the best solution is a self-policing reporting system. Allowing the users themselves to have a say in what is problematic would save a lot of time otherwise needed to moderate the platform.
__label__Position	I think that hate speech should be reduced through widescale education about the origins, hurts and trauma behind words which are used. By educating people learn how to respect or debate in effective ways without insulting or offending. UNESCO are suggesting that addressing hate speech through education can bring respect for each other.
__label__Position	We need to create a society where we can debate with each other respectfully, we can know which platforms to use and not rile each other up without offending. It is widely suggested that education can address the extent of hate speech: https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/addressing-hate-speech-through-education-global-education-ministers-conference. However, this needs to go hand in hand with moderation of sites to ensure people are kept within reason. It is not a case of any one single solution.
__label__Position	I love the suggestions about having real life moderators and user flagging comments for moderation. It's very effective on Meta.
__label__Position	I love the suggestions about having real life moderators and user flagging comments for moderation. It's very effective on Meta.
__label__Position	We can start by encouraging people to debate and say their opinions to incite meaningful and helpful conversations and comments instead of hate and other harmful communication types
__label__Attack	Unfortunately, we are way to late for this. The internet has been used for more than 20 years and it's getting worse. Hate speech does a lot of damages and we need to act quickly because it causes a lot of harm for several groups of people, ethnic groups, etc.
__label__Position	Algorithms for detecting hate speech are not yet as effective as human moderation, but I believe in combination with human moderation it can be a very useful tool to flag only potential comments for manual approval, rather than every comment. https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0221152
__label__Position	The most effective way would be to produce effective and fair algorithms that can detect use of hate speech along with help of human moderation.
__label__Position	My position on the topic still remains to rather find ways to reduce or even eliminate only the hate speech, instead of no speech at all. I find it interesting to read other people's opinions on different types of topics and I usually learn a lot.
__label__Attack	it is not always possible to monitor every single post
__label__Position	Filter the comments so that any with known hate speech terms cant be posted. Make sure people sign in to make comments etc
__label__Support	i agree with having to sign in to be able to comment.
__label__Position	FILTER
__label__Position	You would need to detect which accounts are using hate speech and ban them from writing posts
__label__Attack	What happens if they are detected falsely using hate speech
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	As a moderator in other capacities, I can tell you it takes a lot of time to manually review every single comment as they come in.
__label__Attack	We can always try to reduce it. It's important to let people with good intentions comment and protect them against hate speech commets, than can do a lot of harm https://www.coe.int/en/web/cyberviolence/online-hate-speech-and-hate-crime
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Support	Yep, it needs to be a holistic approach. People have a right to speech but they need to be educated in how to express them kindly.
__label__Support	Hate speech should be considered as a crime and people who promote or do hate should save time

__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	But proper moderation is difficult to achieve.
__label__Position	you ca reduce hate speech by adding an ai bot that can distinguishly remove between violent words from a comment. A report button is as useful which can allow for moderators to review comments and decide on the level of polarization.
__label__Support	Hate speech is complex and jubjective. AI is still developing and not good enough to understand basic debate let alone interpret language, Too easy for AI to take words out of context.
__label__Position	The newspaper websites should have AI bots that are able to detect negative comments and strong hate words so they are able to monitor which comments should be posted or not
__label__Position	this is not possible, this will result in censorship.
__label__Position	this is not possible, you either allow free speech or you don't
__label__Position	It is only possible t have the comment section removed in order to relive audience from seeing hate peech under posted magazines. It may infring frree speech, but prodominety shall remove hate speech which can be scientifically tomrmenting to the mind.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.

__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Attack	Hate speech is not just someone's opinion. It affects people's lives with real consequences, resulting with cases such as severe depression and suicide. https://www.journalofcommunication.ro/index.php/journalofcommunication/article/view/322/307
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Hate speech can unfortunetely bean opinion base within this modern world. Being oversentativie to certain comments can pottentially reduce freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	I agree with removing comments but not for this reason
__label__Support	Just remove comment ability

__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Attack	Many user has been learned using words, that algoritm can rotate
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Attack	Comment sections have become so ingrained in the news website experience that their removal will at first seem almost an affront to free speech.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Attack	Why couldn't you directly comment on the newspaper? How is a different platform going to really help?
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Attack	I agree that restricting comments would limit hate speech
__label__Support	Removing comment spaces completely reduces social participation which is super imporrant for educating others.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	Re-education sounds quite dystopian.
__label__Support	educating people
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	Whilst moderation can be good, you're at the whims of the moderators own thoughts and prejudices. And at times may not be acting in the interests of the organisation they're working for.
__label__Position	By having rules or standards everyone needs to adhere to
__label__Attack	It's a good idea, but too many get giddy at trying to break rules and in doing so, ruin things.
__label__Position	Everyone has very different lived experiences. Comment sections should be a place for open and fair discussion. We just need people to oversee these conversation to make sure hate speech is not present and everyone gets a fair say.
__label__Position	Using tool, that automaticully remove discussions where is wrong kind words
__label__Attack	Banning comments only based on keywords will remove certain comments fore sure but won't help in reducing hate speech
__label__Position	using moderators to regulate the comment section and removing offensive/harmful content and taking disciplinary action against accounts that often post/take part in promoting harmful material
__label__Position	reader comments are important and helpful to many users as well as the newspaper website as it can provide crucial feedback as well as being a place to further discuss relevant topics. it should not be removed but there can be many steps taken to make sure it is void of any harmful or offensive material. for example, using a program to detect and remove comments containing offensive words, or having moderators to manually remove/take disciplinary action against harmful comments and accounts
__label__Position	Simply removing the comment section on newspapers websites seems too simple to be effective. Hate speech are allowed by the fact that people are fairly anonymous on Internet. So a solution would be to implement some kind of ID check before creating a profile allowing to comment. If someone knows they can be traced back, their speech will also be not hateful.

__label__Position	this is an example of how one country chose to deal with combating hate comments without infringing on the freedom of speech- by imposing a bill where a person can be sentenced accordingly
__label__Position	Maybe they can have an algorithm or ad admin who checks and approved the comments that don't have any hate speech or have certain words barred
__label__Position	By monitoring individual responses and removing those not deemed suitable for publication
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	Removing them removes those concerns and creates a more positive website experience for the reader
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	while free speech is our right and we are entitled to our own opinions, when you are promoting/endorsing hatred and discrimination of any sort, the line should be drawn. having a discussion/debate with opposing sides is normal and gives insight to both sides with little bias, but that cannot be used as an excuse to be hateful or discriminatory.

__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Attack	How do you propose to address the root causes?
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Attack	comments can be moderated and removed
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	However it could be argued that t it is so difficult for moderators to see the difference between someone practicing their freedom of speech and the idea of hate speech against a protected characteristic.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	I think we can do this by having comments sufficiently moderated and removed if needed if they are producing hate speech.
__label__Support	This would work well with non-bias moderators
__label__Support	Facts
__label__Support	Freedom of speech
__label__Position	Comments are important as it can help create a balanced view and promote healthy discussion, maybe software could pick up on key words or phrases and then a moderator could look more in depth at questionable comments.
__label__Attack	yes i argree with this. it would not show that the newspaper is biased by leaving the positive comments only
__label__Position	We can fairly reduce hate speech from websites withou teliminating space for readers comments through education on the moderators on what the fine line is, in my opinion!
__label__Position	This can be done through lectures and youtube videos highlighting how moderators should approach those committing hate speech. It can also be done by teaching what hate speech itself actualy is, and how it affects people.
__label__Position	We can also do this through letting moderators know how it feels to be victim to hate speech online, through getting hate speech victims to describe what it feels like, so moderators are more precise with their moderation!
__label__Position	One interesting argment I feel is quite important to consider, is when you are posting your comments online, does that comment come from you or could some argue / percieve that it comes from the company hosting the discussion, as quoted in this article: https://time.com/5770755/threat-free-speech-online/
__label__Position	comments should be moderated but we cannot remove all the negative and leave the positive comments. it would look like the newspaper is being biased
__label__Support	Its ok to have some negative comments as long as they are balanced and not offensive or personal
__label__Support	Its ok to have some negative comments as long as they are balanced and not offensive or personal
__label__Position	Another interesting argument is that there is a risk with platforms that alllow annonynimity online. For example as quoted here: https://www.csl.mtu.edu/cs6461/www/Reading/Davenport02.pdf and it can allow hate speech to go unmoderated.
__label__Position	i think a law should be made that if you do not delete hate speech from your website or article than that newspaper will have to pay a fine.
__label__Attack	It can be difficult to monitor everything all the time, but I think if something is reported and not deleted then fair enough.
__label__Position	I support the decision of newspapers to remove the comments section. They should have letters pages like theiur hard copy versions where a letters editor decides what should be published.
__label__Position	Newspaper comments and letters pages in particular are a good place for national conversations
__label__Position	maybe if certain words are used, they are recognized and the post cant be posted.
__label__Position	hear is a study based on this, worth a read https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea
__label__Position	Head speech acan also have a very negative impact on people mental health too. the newspapers can make people look really bad and not write the correct information. we all remember how much the media contributed to Caroline Flack. Im NHS staff, all the stuff that was said about us during COVID. most was ok but you look at papers now and read comments about us now, than 2yrs ago when we were heros. its so depressing

__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes

__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Attack	I think some people are out there to hurt so know they're commenting hateful things but know they can get away with it because there are no consequences.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed

__label__Support	Potentially reduces correction or dissenting information on the article
__label__Position	The editor must appoint a diverse panel, meaning from different backgrounds to screen comments
__label__Position	I think there could newspapers should have a policy where they have the right to delete any comment that is hate speech.
__label__Support	One of the problems with social media is the use of bots which dramatically wreak havoc with algorithms. It creates a technical imbalance and an environment that is less reality based and more echo chamber. Cleaning this up would be a huge start.
__label__Support	internet is not a devil, people are
__label__Support	only likes and dislikes are enough
__label__Position	REMOVAL OF HATE SPEECH DOESN'T ENTAIL THAT THE SOCIETY IS NOT DEMOCRATIC.I BELIEVE IT IS SAFE SINCE NEWSPAPERS ACCOMODATES DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS FROM DIFFERENT SOCIETIES.SO BASIC NON HATE SPEECH LANGUAGE IS FAIR TO MY OWN POINT OF VIEW
__label__Position	I think the ultimate solution is educating people on hate speech but the newspapers should also not spread the hate speech
__label__Position	monitor the comments that are posted
__label__Attack	people are going to feel like their views are supressed
__label__Position	It still seems important to focus more on reporting the news and far less on giving a newspapers opinion of the news. But straight news doesn't make the clicks or the money. Looking at the current changes to CNN are a good indication that anger sells and straight news does not.The anger is what keeps the comments sections alive.

__label__Position	The comment section is a good way to be interactive with the public and creates a community where discussions can take place and people get to exercise freedom of speech. However if not regulated it could cause harm because people use it for hate speech
__label__Position	Given that hate speech is an illegal and destructive thing (https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=Detection%20of%20anti-social%20behaviour%20in%20online%20communication%20in%20Arabic) and given that moderation is often opaque and unaccountable (https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=The%20New%20Governors:%20The%20People,%20Rules%20and%20Processes%20Governing%20Online%20Speech) I think I'd go back to my original comment and highlight a system focused on transparency, perhaps similar to reddit and/or wikipedia where almost all social interactions are documented and available under a persons username reference, thus allowing for easy accountability either for other readers to review, moderators to ban (or restrict) and police and other legal systems to use as evidence if and when needed.
__label__Support	I agree to remove it and that opinions should be on the third party sites.
__label__Attack	It does take away freedom of speech on the website
__label__Position	I think monitoring the comments through AI or a human would solve the issue while allowing free speech
__label__Position	I think comments should definitely not be deleted. It's a lazy way of reducing free speech.
__label__Position	Technology should be used to detect and remove hate speech. An example of how well this has worked is Facebook (https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/hate-speech-prevalence-dropped-facebook/) which said hate speech has dropped by almost 50% with their algorithms.

__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?

__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Attack	This is not in line with our right to freedom of speech.

__label__Position	It goes further than this. We live in a society that has a lot of cry babies. We need to be impervious to negative comments from strangers on a social platform and that is anonymous. Most people need to grow a pair, develop a spine or stop being cry babies. Once this is achieved you will see that any contribution you make to a discussion will be debated in a civilized manner.
__label__Attack	I believe you are referencing an AI, but that would require certain technology and datasets for it to understand what to look for. You can also argue that hateful words can be used in a certain context to argue a point, rather than as a directly hateful comment.
__label__Attack	I agree,the should be someone who's hired to check comment and to block.Also those who bully people shoul not be allowed on the site
__label__Position	The comments could be examined for offensive language. For instance, there might be a robot that scans comments for offensive language and deletes them.
__label__Attack	Not allowing hateful comment does not mean we limit people freedom of speech but promote kindness.
__label__Position	We all understand the importance of freedom of speech but hate speech cannot be tolerated and for newspapers to continue using the readers comments section its important that they must have a website bot or person who will be responsible in blocking hate speech comments and ensure that individuals who use hate speech are blocked from ever engaging on their platform.
__label__Position	By currating comments individualy in person upon reporting. Auto block certain words e.g N word
__label__Position	https://law.stanford.edu/projects/regulating-freedom-of-speech-on-social-media-comparing-the-eu-and-the-u-s-approach/ The blurred dichotomy between what makes a good or bad speech makes it hard to define how a comment section should be moderated.

__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	People should be allowed to give their opinions because where else will be able to read how people feel about certain things happening around other than comments. I just think they should be monitored and taught to not post hateful comments.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	True and in my opinion the right to freedom of speech should trump any counter argument.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Support	Would benefit society more in long term.
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Support	I absolutely agree, everyone should be able to express how they feel however shouldn't do so at the expense of others.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Support	comments can be important to portray the views of the opposing 'side' of the narrative of the article
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Support	i agree with the comment about fake news, a lot of people reading online articles are vulnerable to taking information at face value without checking whether or not there is actual evidence for this
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	A combination of computerise moderation (to filter out offensive words) and human moderators can reduce such hate speech.
__label__Position	attaching more serious sanctions for people who use harmful/hateful speech.
__label__Position	filtering undesirabled words and employing human mods to check comments
__label__Position	By making sure that contributors/writers remove any hate or negative speech if it violates the guidlines set.
__label__Position	Hate speech must be eliminated. The only way to do this thoroughly is with human moderation.
__label__Support	this is a great way to monitor the section
__label__Support	law enforcement could be notified easily
__label__Position	Use software to filter out offesive words.
__label__Position	if technology is improved, it would make it easier to identify and possibly eliminate hate speech ASAP. furthermore, this will allow the poers that be to identify the people responsible for spreading hate speech and potentially allow for authorities to intervene. hate speech deeply affects and threatens us as humans, therefore it should be taken seriously.
__label__Position	I believe a new software should be made that becomes an extension to an app that will block the hate speech
__label__Position	the comment section is for sharing information and opinions without the need of hate speech. those who promote and share hate speech should get banned from the comment section
__label__Attack	Without the use of id and controls to set up acounts, people once banned will just create new accounts.
__label__Support	It is great to ban them but they would create different profiles again to put out their comments. One good side of this idea is that they would consistently have to do extra work in creating new profiles to put out their hate speeches, and hopefully, one day they would be tired and give up.
__label__Position	In as much as we would like to shy away from it, it is inevitable that people will have something negative to say. It is up to the developers of the website to filter through comments or at least set an approval time for each post.
__label__Support	that is true the developers hate to filter, using mods and bots to detect the hate speech
__label__Support	https://www.unia.be/en/areas-of-action/media-and-internet/internet/how-to-deal-with-hate-speech
__label__Support	the link provides usefull ways for people to deal with hate speech
__label__Support	yes. if their going to make money from individuals, they should also suffer the consequence of creating a safe space for them.
__label__Position	newspapers can invest in software that will filter offensive words.
__label__Position	I think there should be a limit where this "hate speech" is only about the work that is done in order to be criticized. Otherwise it becomes very hard to distinguish whether a criticism is about the work or is it personal attack.
__label__Position	Hate speech is not a criticsm and should be avoided
__label__Attack	it is a thin line to censorship
__label__Support	even if it were criticism not all criticism is valid and should deserve a space
__label__Position	Freedom of speech does not mean freedom of consequence, just because you say something it should not be without consequence if it is harmful. Hate speech is harmful and should be restricted and most of the time it is not constructive or helpful.
__label__Position	by actively reviewing the comments and restricting hate-related language
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.

__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Attack	limitations are important.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Support	people will be deterred to rely on information on newspapers if there are no guidelines regulating hate speech
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	There are always other spaces, such as reddit or twitter, where one can discuss articles- they do not have to be discussed on the same page they are presented
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Support	Agree with this. It's about getting the balance right to allow people to voice their opinions and add to the discussion without being hateful to others
__label__Attack	I agree while hate speech can be and should be monitored and removed immediately in order to reduce trauma on affected group and not to embolden other bigots. Platforms should still allow users to express opinions contrary to the creators. Peer review of reporting works well in these instances when someone goes too far - but this is also abused by with review bombing
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Attack	i don't agree with this - you should be able to give an opinion if it is valid and relevant.
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	It is difficult to determine what is considered hate speech as everyone has their own biases
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	The trouble with the online newspapers/media is they already show bias to certain stories depending on where you read. Comment sections can be useful for discussion but it's a shame that not all people use them in the best way.
__label__Attack	This is totally untrue.Freedom of speech will exist one way or another and newspapers shoul dbe promotign public views by regulated platforms, so they can be in touch with peoples real thinking and also allow othr people form their own opinions about current issues
__label__Attack	If journalistss are allowd hteir view and opinion which in many instances can be objecive, public should defientley be allowed to shar theirs, since ournalists are there to promot information and possibly dialogue as well
__label__Position	I believe comment sections should be moderated more to prevent the obvious hate speech and statements that do not add anything useful to the discussion
__label__Attack	Yes, any views shoudl be substantiated and when its obvious that it serves an agenda it should be deleted
__label__Support	Protected classes can be addressed properly by preferred terms. Reduces fighting over "political" issues instead of the subject at hand
__label__Position	Just pay moderators
__label__Attack	Moderators have their own biases and blind spots who would be picking the moderators?
__label__Position	Develop AI which is able to detect and delete hate speech automatically.
__label__Support	This is silly, AI is always built with the bias of its creators
__label__Attack	agreed.AI woudl be more objective and impartial thtn human moderators
__label__Position	by censoring certain key words that can reflect hate speech
__label__Position	I don't think it's a good idea to eliminate the comment space from newspapers, thereby reducing readers' ability to weigh in on news items. I think newspapers should use software programs that can flag potentially hateful commentary and automatically remove it. As well, newspapers should have moderators who can check to make sure that any hate speech is caught and removed as soon as possible after it appears.
__label__Position	systems need to be able to flag hateful speech in posts and remove them timelessly
__label__Position	The idea behind that is to locked people expression and democratic, we do not need to police everyone, there is a certain freedom of expression
__label__Position	i think the comment section of any newspaper is very important and helps the newspaper understand how it's readers are feeling. it shouldn't be a difficult task to find a way to reduce Hate within the comments.
__label__Position	Taking an evidence based approach, it does seem that removing hate speech can reduce its effect, but it might drive its would be posters onto more extremeist online communities where they are able to reinforce their views. Thus it makes the views less acceptable, but reinforces and radicalises a small number. Thus, education and inclusivity of all- no matter their beliefs- has an important civic purpose.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a big issue on the internet and social media in general, it is a very bad idea to eliminate comment sections in their entirety. Doing this can give rise to extremist websites whether they are on the left or right. There are many ways to control it but each has their own pros and cons. At this point it is impossible to know which method is the best, the best option would be to run tests and see how the users react.
__label__Position	In summary, I think comment sections in newspapers should be preserved but with some form of moderation -- both automatic through software and human-driven. I recognize that there is a need to protect free speech, but hate speech goes beyond the type of discourse that should be protected.
__label__Position	I think will be fair to eliminate the space because everyone needs to give their opinion so it must be better to come up with a solution to block those who post hate speech
__label__Position	Peer reviews of reporting comments should be checked by at least two moderators with two different background in order to facilitate the process and prevent review bombing instead of policing hate speeach
__label__Attack	The problem with allowing commentary to flourish without restrictions is that it can undermine the credibility of legitimate news sources. Frank Waddell, associate journalism professor at the University of Florida, noted that “If you see a bunch of individuals online who are leaving negative comments on a news article, you might think most people are evaluating this news as low quality,” Waddell said. “When asked to evaluate the news yourself, you might also think the news is more negative relative to someone who reads that same article without comments.” https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/
__label__Attack	Agreed. I found a similar article and the more people feel censored the more hate sites thrive. Instead of a platform where people can engage and educate.
__label__Position	(https://mediaengagement.org/research/how-the-public-views-deletion-of-offensive-comments/)
__label__Position	agree with not deleting comments, we should live it open and just regulated
__label__Position	For me, the most surprising position expressed here was that there should be no limits on online commenting by the public. I am concerned that such an approach would lead to dissemination of hateful views by a small minority of commenters. According to www.poynter.org, National Public Radio in the U.S. did a survey and found that only 0.06 per cent of users actually commented on their website and that 491,000 comments actually only came from 20,000 individuals. https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/
__label__Position	https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons
__label__Attack	It is a lenthy and compelx issue since different countries seem to have different rules and law governing freedom of speech according to their cultures or even political establishements
__label__Support	Legisation should be applied based on same principles thoughout countries to preserve freedom of speech and also ensure hate speech and arising violence is eliminated
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.

__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments

__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Attack	I agree and I think because there are so many people with so many different opinions, it should be censored before it is either posted or passed through the section.
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Attack	I do not agree with the idea of submitting a large amount of personal data. That is unenforceable and goes against the GDPR. I also do not understand the 're-education' argument. Who is supposed to educate them and are these supposed "educators" professionally qualified?
__label__Attack	Moderators are useful but they will have their own bias and we cannot guarntee that they will be impartial, thus we remain in the same position
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	Asking people to identify themselves when doing their registration. If we remove the anonymous factor, people will be afraid to act like trolls.
__label__Support	I agree, but trolls want to be trolls if they wanted to be trolls. People should be held accountable as well.
__label__Support	I agree this article https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/03/29/the-future-of-free-speech-trolls-anonymity-and-fake-news-online/ speaks about hthis also. Being anon givens comfortability and lets people hide behind a false identity, taking that away would likely reduce hate speech on popular newspaper outlets out of fear of being identified. However, those with these views would likely continue on more far-right news outlets
__label__Position	Removing the comment space from newspapers infringes on on freedom of speech, a sure way to combat this is by eliminating anonymity.
__label__Position	One alternative is the so called watching-eye effect. It is known that "under watching eyes", people tend to present less antisocial behavior, and a higher comment quality in these comment sections. Source: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0144929X.2022.2114937
__label__Position	If the aim is merely to reduce hate speech then I think eradicating the comment section goes too far. Why should people not be allowed to comment and have their say. The newspaper is punishing the public for the crimes of a few. It seems rather unfair. I think the best method is to have monitors.
__label__Position	Free speech is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it is necessary for an effective democratic society and on the other hand, people tend to abuse the right. Newspapers and publishing companies are major symbols of free speech, however, and there will always be disadvantages to be endured, hate speech inclusive. The solution is not to disable comment spaces but to continually implore and push for cooperation amongst readers.
__label__Support	I agree with this argument. It is important to balance the right to freedom of speech against the need to reduce hate speech.
__label__Position	the best way to address hate speech to make it clear to the viewers regarding the consequence of hate speech. Also, only individuals who have registered on the platform after providing their details can be allowed to comment. furthermore, new accounts must be placed on a probation period and cannot be allowed to comment on the same day that they are created.
__label__Support	I agree, these may seem tedious at first but they are necessary actions newspapers should consider.
__label__Support	This is true because it takes the focus away from the real news!

__label__Position	removing the comment section is not a solution to addressing hate speech. The important is not censored viewer comments but to censored hate speech. there are a few options to consider to address this: 1. only registered viewers can make comments. personal information such as identification information that can be used to directly identify the individual commenting. this will reduce hate speech for fear of being exposed in real life and possibly charged with a criminal offense. 2. comments that come through should be filtered through a platform before being posted. 3. addressing hate speech through education is also another option. however, this assumes that people making such comments are not aware of the comments that they make. https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000380290

__label__Position	According to research by La Trobe University Australia, hate speech can be eliminated if we make use of Artificial Intelligence technology. This way, AI can scan the comment sections and search for certain derogatory words and phrases for elimination. This has been suggested by some participants as well. via https://www.latrobe.edu.au/nest/can-combat-rise-online-hate-speech/
__label__Position	The Leadership Conference Education Funds gives us ways to combat hate speech online, whether it be newspapers or social media to make sure that people's rights are protected. A link is given below, because there has been instances that hate speech not only started now but has been with us from eons, but people have found ways to deal with it. Here’s how you can help combat hate speech online and stop the spread of violent actions: Hold platforms accountable for hate speech. Report tweets, YouTube videos, Instagram posts, Facebook posts, and other speech that spreads hate to the platforms that are hosting it and demand action. If given the opportunity, be specific about what you find offensive and why. Raise awareness of the problem. Talk to your friends and family about why hate speech is not a problem just for the internet, but our societies and culture at large. https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=f872b161360cb19eJmltdHM9MTY2NjIyNDAwMCZpZ3VpZD0xNDgwZDNmYy03ZTI1LTYzYzMtMGZiZC1kZDNiN2ZkZDYyOTAmaW5zaWQ9NTQzNw&ptn=3&hsh=3&fclid=1480d3fc-7e25-63c3-0fbd-dd3b7fdd6290&psq=how+to+reduce+hate+speech+online&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9jaXZpbHJpZ2h0cy5vcmcvZWRmdW5kL3Jlc291cmNlL2NvbWJhdC1vbmxpbmUtaGF0ZS1zcGVlY2gvIzp-OnRleHQ9SGVyZSVFMiU4MCU5OXMlMjBob3clMjB5b3UlMjBjYW4lMjBoZWxwJTIwY29tYmF0JTIwaGF0ZSUyMHNwZWVjaCxoYXRlJTIwYWJvdXQlMjB0aGUlMjB3b3JzdCUyMGluc3RhbmNlcyUyMHlvdSUyMHNlZS4lMjA&ntb=1
__label__Position	Learning and unlearning hateful speech has to come from education, being used an early intervention method would likely support a reduction in hate speech overall and therefore in newspapers
__label__Position	1. Integration of the comment section with a non-anonymous social media platform such as Facebook is necessary to reduce hate speech. 2. We need to address the issue of social media encouraging polarising views. Most social media of nowadays allows you create a bubble that shares a singular opinion without looking outside of the bubble. The lack of exposure would contribute to the hate speech. 3. The education system needs an almost complete overhaul. Education about things such as critical thinking, marginalised groups, bullying, creativity and imagination would reduce hate speech because they are well educated. 4. Consideration for every student is important. Things that could prevent a child from learning efficiently are important such as learning disabilities, poverty, etc. They should be addressed by using things like free lunches and creating accommodations. Paying students to go to university would encourage even greater critical thinking 5. The government should care more for its citizens. It is things such as poverty and illness inducing stress that could prevent people from thinking clearly before they speak. Prioritizing happiness and wellbeing would most definitely contribute to the lowering of hate speech by for example, highlighting the country’s nature, prioritising social welfare, and closing the gap between the rich and poor. In conclusion, the truth of the matter is that people have these horrible opinions because they are stressed about something and cannot think clearly. That and a lack of education. Focusing on these issues would result in a massive decrease of hate speech
__label__Position	The government needs to address this issue at its root instead of looking for a bandaid to put over the issue. That means prioritising social welfare and improving the education system because the main reason why there is so much hate speech is because of a lack of education and stress that prevents people from seeing clearly.
__label__Position	Possibly it depends on the story in the newspaper, but generally speaking does anyone really pay attention to the comments? Sometimes people go out of their way to cause uproar and a lot of the comments, especially in the Daily Mail, are actually bots confessing true love to their "princess Meghan"
__label__Position	My position is that comments should be allowed and not taken too seriously, although if someone replies to a comments, it is probably to point out an error.
__label__Support	I agree with this sentiment it is surely a step in preventing the spread of hate speech.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	we cannot remove reviewer comments altogether. i believe a method to filter or censored hate speech is necessary.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Support	I agree it would be a good solution better than moderators because moderators are humans and they can make mistakes.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Support	I completely agree as people will just go elsewhere and make it much more worse.
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Attack	They should still be responsible for their words, as they are adults, so surely they know what they are doing.
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Support	I find it very helpful when the comments includes updates or links to a more current news story
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	There must be a team of moderators, who constantly look at new comments being posted, and approve them to be visible for others, or remove if inappropriate.
__label__Attack	A bot could not fully remove hate speech and could even possibly remove valid points and arguments thinking it was hate speech.
__label__Position	It would be a shame to remove the comment space from online newspaper articles - although I don't think that removing it would be undemocratic, or an infringement of freedom of speech. People are free to pass comment elsewhere after all, in their own blogs or social media pages. I think part of the problem with online commenting is that people can do it anonymously and without fear of reprisal. If every online comment had to be linked to an identifiable person - so readers could see who they were, who their friends were, where they worked - I think there would be less of a problem with hate speech.
__label__Position	Some people just like to spread their negative vibes on strangers, not worried about serious consequences, as the worst thing that can happen to them is the comment being removed. There should be consequences!
__label__Attack	I agree, but I don't know what the mechanism would be for linking comments to the actual people who made them.
__label__Support	Yes, and online people do things casually - clicking 'like' or retweeting without any kind of fact-checking.
__label__Position	I think removing the comment space is just avoiding the problem. There can be interesting and thoughtful comments and we would miss from them. Newspapers websites should instead try to regulate the comment space by introducing a bot or hiring appropriate moderators or there should be some punishment to discourage the use of hate speech.
__label__Support	I think adding chat bans for repeat offenders of hate speech could help.
__label__Position	I found this article:https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/14/meet-guardian-best-below-the-line-commenters
__label__Position	Sorry, I intended to add to the above Guardian-article-link, that it surprised me because it suggested that, to some extent - and in some forums - online commenting is not anonymous. I was quite heartened to read that a few of those commenters interviewed had actually been temporarily banned at one time or another, for some comment they made, and that actually this had greatly affected them. Possibly this is just the attitude of this people who actually take responsibility for their own comments and are willing to be identified, though. I don't imagine that the people who make death threats or rape threats are quite so distressed by the prospect of being thrown out of a forum.
__label__Support	I agree with you, anonymity does seem to increase the level of hate speech and trolling. I found this article interesting though, it talks about the risks of splintering the internet if AI is used to limit speech too strongly. I found it interesting https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/03/29/the-future-of-free-speech-trolls-anonymity-and-fake-news-online/
__label__Position	Removing hate speech from comment section should be a must as there should not be any room for hate speech in our society. My original thought was that commenters should not be allowed to remain anonymous and that any hate speech by them should have real life consequences. Having had this original thought I am now inclined to say that commenters should be allowed to remain anonymous an example behind my thoughts are that in some countries it is illegal to be gay and those who are, are persecuted. If for example they wanted to post on an article or give an opinion on an LGBTQ issue then they could be identified. There are more reason to remain anonymous, found here https://www.techiexpert.com/reasons-why-people-seek-anonymity-on-the-internet/
__label__Attack	This is what most social media companies already do. Often the AI sensors the conversation based on the pre-selected criteria without the intervention of any human moderator, because there is too much traffic for humans to monitor. This leads to a reduction in free-speech.
__label__Attack	While I see the logic to this argument, the publics interaction with paper newspapers and slower press looks to have declined according to this article, therefore I'm not sure this solution would work: https://clubs.waketech.edu/wake-review/magazine/creative-writing/non-fiction/the-decline-in-newspapers-a-closer-look-joseph-ahrens/
__label__Position	Defining "hate" speech is difficult. A good starting point is The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (summarised on Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_laws_in_the_United_Kingdom ) but I would strongly suggest looking at the original source in English Law.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	I think that removing peoples ability to comment would be more harm than good because they will just do it elsewhere like social media platforms.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Attack	I agree that in removing hate speech there is a chance that we could be silencing valid criticism and curtailing freedom of speech. However, I do think that sometimes there can be a fine line between criticism and hate speech and I would much rather see valid criticism removed than to see hate speech spread.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	While I agree that it is free speech, just because it's free speech shouldn't mean it should be allowed especially when its there for everyone to see.
__label__Attack	But allowing hate speech to flourish would mean that comment space would be filled with spammers and hate speech and it would become useless.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	While I agree that hate speech is such, I feel like getting rid of the comment section would really go backwards and do more harm than good.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Attack	I definitely agree on the part of sciencing valid criticism
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Attack	I don't think algorithm can accurately detect hate speech.
__label__Attack	I think the comment sections still need to be a respectful safe place to share your opinions. Free speech can be communicated in respectful way and still get your point/opinion across
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	But humans are humans and some abuse these priveleges by posting what they like without considering the consequences.
__label__Attack	Taking away comments will mean a one sided news media and that is dangerous.
__label__Support	Thats why its best to have set rules. Like swear language, certain words, threats and stuff like that but anything that is just opinion should be allowed no matter if you disagree or don't like what is said.
__label__Support	It is important to review your comment before posting it, online there is more chance of being misinterpreted so carefully choosing your words can help to minimise this.
__label__Support	To add to my previous comment about having clear and established rules I refer to https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/article-1388145/House-Rules.html The daily mail is well known for having a very open and sometimes contentious comment section. By having clear rules and removing posts that break rules and not based on opinion or thought. You can allow people to say controversial things as long as they stay within some boundaries
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Attack	I agree with Dominic , who becomes judge of what is true, what is without bias, what is hateful versus what is simply disagree, disapprove, dislike. Do we say happy things only and simply create artifical safe spaces where only positive ego boosting comments are allowed?
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Attack	There’s a psychological effect where being presented with information, even in the context of given facts of“this is wrong and inaccurate” actually reinforces the belief in that information if you already made up your mind on the issue.
__label__Attack	When your beliefs are entwined with your identity, changing your mind means changing your identity. That’s really hard for most people.
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.

__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	have an active moderator to remove any hate speech
__label__Support	this would be a good start, i think that having a moderator would help to eliminate hate speech
__label__Attack	some people would still make hate comments, as they could give a false name to begin with.
__label__Position	Having moderators or AI to automatically remove content that includes keywords with cursing or inflammatory language, having a report/flag button so people can report and remove very offensive things
__label__Support	I agree, I think and AI could filter this faster than a person. Also giving people to opportunity to report will help as well.
__label__Position	I believe that having free speech is totally fine but comments that are offensive, hate speech or discriminatory in any way should be removed. The comment section should be monitored.
__label__Attack	I disagree, the person commenting can do so in a manner that isn't hateful. Only people who choose hate as their platform in getting their opinion across will be blocked. Hopefully these people rethink their approach and try again in a different manner
__label__Position	Hate speech is a topic that has many sides. it depends on a person what they see as hate speech. I can see an opinion on a subject while another person will feel attacked by that opinion. This is a thin red line that I do think AI's created in the world with trying to please everybody. In the end, the opinion of a person is not seen as an opinion anymore, but rather hate speech. My suggestion would be for all people to respect each others opinion, like we use to and not take everything so personal now a days. If the shoe fits, wear it. If it does not effect you, don't comment. And NEVER be personal in your opinion. Live and let live again in the world is what is needed.
__label__Position	I guess hate speech is open to interpretation. What might be interpreted as hate speech or offensive by me might not be the case for my fellow citizen. So it is a really fine line. So how do you manage that effectively? Will an AI be sufficient? Costs for human intervention would be too high.
__label__Position	I would say i agree with DamianC, in as much as control can be implicated to have order, we end being biased in allowing some to share their opinions and some to be blocked off, essentially we just need to respect one another.
__label__Position	I think nowadays most people keep up to date with the day's news via social media sites such as Instagram, Twitter or Facebook. So removing comment section from news sites will not stop the hate speech as this could be done freely on any of the other platforms. You are never going to get away from hate speech completely but I do think limiting same by using AI could help in reducing same.
__label__Position	We cannot reduce hate speech because in as much as it is hate speech, it is still speech which everyone has a right of, if everyone respected one another we would not have this problem, having speech never created to much freedom, but losing respect for someone else is where the problem begins .
__label__Position	i would say having the option to report an offensive comment would help, other than nothing at all because then that is a start to correcting someone's choice of words or point of view.
__label__Position	Unfortunately the definition of hate speech differs from country to country and in some, they exclude certain races, certain groups, and the list go on. The UN has a guideline of what hate speech is, but again, someone commenting from another country does not really see that as hate speech, while the other do. Again, this is where AI technology is not such a good idea to moderate a platform. I do think that hate speech has become so broad in some countries that one can not say anything, or someone takes offence. So, what do one do, well, do not get personal. I agree with NormanW that they can disable comments when a topic is sensitive. That will avoid personalized comments. I agree also with JenniferP, hate speech should not be tolerated, but that does not mean you must take offence if a comment is not directed at you. Do not take every comment personal. I am the older generation, and we use to keep our opinions non personal and use to RESPECT people and their opinions. But times has changed and here we are. I still would like to see peoples opinion and agree with moderation by REAL people of NON bias status.
__label__Position	Check this out https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/03/29/the-future-of-free-speech-trolls-anonymity-and-fake-news-online/
__label__Position	Maybe if the person commenting can only do so through a social profile like Facebook, it would police their response more so than being anonymous? Although someone can just make a fake account and I have seen people ruin their social reputation by saying questionable things online very publicly and not caring so moderators may be the best option.
__label__Position	i think that if you are going to leave comments your name should also be published.if you could do it so people have to sign up before they can comment.
__label__Attack	You can reduce hate speech in the comment section by flagging certain vocabulary which directly relates to hate speech, which then will automatically block the comment and therefore cannot be posted.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Attack	Stops hates speech
__label__Support	Stops people with genuine none discriminatory opinions to express themselves
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Support	Absolutely. I think there is a thin line between disallowing free speech and blocking what others may see as hate speech. The trick is finding a balance between the two. The newspaper must avoid being seen as blocking views that may differ with them.
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Support	Yes but it can also reduce the preaching of misinformation and hateful ideologies
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	By 'standards', maybe certain words should be blocked? Users who continue to post blocked words eventually being banned.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Support	I disagree with this. Previous to social media and comment sections, newspapers often printed responses from readers. Journalists and those giving opinion pieces should face scrutiny and feedback from readers.
__label__Position	Could there be some coding introduced to remove foul language before it's even posted?
__label__Position	Moderation, as a paid (not volunteer) role.
__label__Position	it can be done
__label__Position	There should be some filters to remove bad comments
__label__Support	I agree with this, or some coding introduced in the background somehow to not even allow bad comments/words to be posted at all.
__label__Attack	i'm not sure this would allow the nuance that only a human could see though?
__label__Position	It can be done by taking into consideration the feelings of the people who will get to read the newspaper. The person or persons that will be responsible in writing the newspaper must know what will and will not hurt the people who will be reading the newspaper.
__label__Position	I think there should be red flagged or blacklisted words that shouldn't be allowed to be used in reader's comments. If a certain post contain such words, it should not be automatically exposed to other readers but should be reviewed first by the admin to check if it meets the standard before being exposed to everyone.
__label__Support	I feel like this would be the mos t ideal solution.
__label__Position	Hate comments are always not good for any person
__label__Position	Ai and human moderation combined could combat a fair amount of hate speech https://www.samaritans.org/about-samaritans/research-policy/internet-suicide/guidelines-tech-industry/effective-content-moderation/
__label__Position	Websites can use filter options as mentioned here in this article, https://www.consumerreports.org/social-media/filter-hate-speech-hoaxes-violent-clips-out-of-social-media-a6432199534/
__label__Position	It looks as if the Government have been trying in recent years to develop plans for tackling hate crime - including targeting schools, working with newspapers and media to spread the word.
__label__Position	Freedom of speech is important but it should not infringe on other people's rights. Hate speech does infringe on other people's rights but this should not affect people who also use the website to comment.

__label__Position	moderating the comments
__label__Position	moderating the comments
__label__Position	moderating the comments would surely help
__label__Position	use an algorithm to filter out words such as slurs and offensive phrases but also have a person who's looks over the comment in order to make sure they comply with hate speech legislation
__label__Position	It is important that people are able to have a voice, especially as it can be a great tool in educating people, and giving people a variety of viewpoints that they wouldn't necessarily get to often hear. Sometimes we learn best by hearing and understanding the views of other people. We don't have to necessarily change our opinions, but it can help us become more aware of why or how people feel a certain way about things.
__label__Attack	I can see their point of view, however hate speech can't be considered a viewpoint as most times there isn't even a good enough argument to support people that leave hate speech's point of view.
__label__Position	I stand by what I previously said and think that moderating the comment section is the best solution.
__label__Position	It is so important that we are able to give opinions and reactions to newspapers on their platforms. Free speech should be encouraged, not silenced. It can be moderated, and those who abuse this space should be dealt with accordingly. https://www.liberties.eu/en/stories/why-is-freedom-of-speech-important/44136
__label__Attack	its hard to find moderators without bias
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	I think that would be unfair to other people who do not post hate speech.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Support	Could exclude nasty comments
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Support	This could be done through public opinion, such as what the general public would consider less restricted and what is acceptable in current society.
__label__Support	It is important that views are challenged and there is a forum to do that in
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Support	educational policy
__label__Support	I agree and also that some comment may not have been posed to upset/hurt, but can do, so educating people in how to respond would be a good thing.
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	This may negatively impact the public. As newspapers may publish news in a manner deceiving the truth and those who are not aware would believe lies.
__label__Position	Not possible to to it completely, hate spech can be quite subtle. Needs real time moderation.
__label__Attack	In a fast moving comments section with lots of commentators it would be impossible to moderate in real time.
__label__Support	The fact we are discussing it with different responses is evidence of your point that it is a very difficult question to find a solution to.
__label__Position	I think it is ok to remove the comments. There are other places people can go to express opinions.
__label__Attack	If a moderator removes a comment then they should have to justify why to the contributor who may be upset at their comment being removed.
__label__Position	People do not fully understand the power of words and the affect they have on others. Removing the comments section would provide a solution but this would also limit others from giving their fair opinion. A system should rather be implemented in which hate speech can be detected and individuals held liable for their comments.
__label__Support	It reduces hatred
__label__Support	I agree it is an individual's responsiblity to choose their words carefully, and if they don't then their comments, or eventually if they persist, their accounts should be removed.
__label__Position	This is possible, in fact awareness should be brought to this topic.
__label__Support	agree
__label__Attack	this is true opinion is important
__label__Support	https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/combat-online-hate-speech/#
__label__Position	Holding platforms responsible for all content they publish would help
__label__Attack	Whilst I agree that the platforms should be responsible, with the vast numbers of people contributing to some platforms it is virtually impossible to moderate every single comment.
__label__Position	I think that the idea of users submitting personal data before making a comment can have positive and negative effects - positive in the sense that the user may think twice before posting hate speech and that they can be tracked down and educated; negative in the sense that the user could be on a website that wants to use user's personal data for the wrong reasons. I am still of the view that comments with hate speech need to be filtered out because each individual needs to be responsible in their speech.
__label__Position	There is no cure for hate speech, but there is a way to stand up against it. Speak out against hate speech - fight racism and bigotry with love, empathy, compassion, and strength. We may not be able to eliminate hatred entirely, but the more steps we can take to educate and support human beings, and speak out against injustice, the better this world will become. Resources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech
__label__Support	A way to deal with this could be starting laws against hate speech or have punishments in place.
__label__Position	Hate speech should be addressed by the public. Those who see the hateful comments should not continue pass it but rather bring it to others attention and stand against what is being said. The problem remains if everyone is not willing to do anything. Once people realise that there are consequences, that is when hate speech will reduce. Read here: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/take-action/engage
__label__Position	People can be shown all the ways that they should act but if they are not held responsible they will not watch what they say https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/take-action/engage
__label__Position	A position that surprised me is one that says that "... there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers". Newspapers are run by humans and humans can make mistakes. Also, engagement on current affairs is very helpful should the newspaper article be written in a manner that may be confusing to some people. I think educating people on the devastating impacts of hate speech should be prioritized. Posts with hate speech should be removed and the user who posted it should be educated on why their comment contains hate speech. Education on how to be a socially connected population should also be prioritized. https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech
__label__Position	Only allow people to chose their comments from a pre-set acceptable range of options. These could range from being pro or against an issue but prevent hateful language from appearing.
__label__Position	/?Are there ways to better police it and identify key words/phrases? Is there an automated moderator program?
__label__Attack	I don't think this is the way forward - check out this article:https://ai.facebook.com/blog/ai-advances-to-better-detect-hate-speech/
__label__Position	Despite our general right to freedom of speech, hate speech remains inextricably linked to hate crimes and intolerance. A hard stance should be taken by newspapers against hate speech, utilising moderators to remove hateful comments, despite the fact that it could be construed as a restriction on free speech.
__label__Attack	Free speech should be entouraged but newspapers should have more responsibility to moderate
__label__Position	Totally eliminating space for commenting is, I think, morally wrong. Debate and discussion is vital in the creation of new ideas and a fantastic way for people to explore and develop their opinions on a massive range of subjects.
__label__Position	Despite my defence of human moderators, it seems they too are flawed -- check out this article https://www.technologynetworks.com/informatics/news/ai-trusted-as-much-as-humans-to-flag-hate-speech-365777 -- human moderators are not only prone to bias but also impractical. With the huge wealth of content posted every second online, it is unrealistic to expect humans to be able to view, criticise, and moderate every single comment.
__label__Attack	I agree that it is impossible for a human moderator to read every comment and react quick enough to an offensive comment before it has been read by other commentators.
__label__Position	A difficult question and I don't believe there is an easy solution.
__label__Position	Hate speech is something people intentionally and so if people continue to participate in it, they should be punished.
__label__Support	If the platform is held accountable for allowing hateful speech, then this would set an example to others, both platforms and people, and eventually there would be more control over this happening freely.
__label__Attack	On the other hand if platforms are held accountable, they may prefer to remove all comments sections, so as not to be punished themselves.
__label__Support	I think this already happens on some sites (flagging offensive comments) and is a good way of ensuring any comments which may offend someone, can be moderated and removed if necessary.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Attack	there is always a need for opinions
__label__Support	agree
__label__Attack	Personally I like to read other peoples' comments, it can offer an alternative view to the first comment being made and it opens your mind to accepting other views.
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	Celebrities are a massive victim of hate speech allowing people the freedom of commenting what they want is harmful. A lot of the time articles will use these comments in other articles to back up negative opinions about others
__label__Attack	It is too dangerous to allow everyone and anyone to say exactly what they like, there has to be some rules in order to protect people. It's a form of manners that we expect from each other in every day life, and should be no different just because we are online saying something.
__label__Support	This is a very good point. And will make the reading experience pleasant. Another method that can combat hate speech is education. When it comes to bullying, cyberbullying, harassment, and hate crimes, the more people are educated on these issues, the more we can prevent them in the future.
__label__Attack	I don't agree with removing the space for views to be aired. That is an important part of challenging and changing opinion. I agree that hate speech should not be tolerated so finding the users and punishing them is key.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Attack	people can no longer criticise
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Support	I agree, hate speech needs to be dealt with from the root of the problem, it is not the responsibility of news services to police this.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Attack	Polarization is necessary, without it newspapers would be able to deliver any information to the public uncontested.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Attack	I don't think the best education policy will combat trolls, bad faith actors or targeted/well orchestrated hate campaigns.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Support	I agree somewhat.
__label__Attack	Someone needs to be employed to regulate the chat
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Position	Comments could be reviewed by a computer/algorithm to see if they contain hate speech
__label__Attack	Robots cannot feel empathy or anything to distinguish between a regular comment and a comment containing hate speech.
__label__Position	Develop a software that will not allow posting of any hate speech
__label__Support	Software is efficient
__label__Position	Have comments checked before posting
__label__Position	checking the comments before allow the user to post it
__label__Position	people who comment hate speech should be banned
__label__Support	completly agree
__label__Position	Everybody should be allowed to have their own opinion but at the same time they need to be respectful of others and be aware that not everybody has the same views.
__label__Position	Not allowing of comments attributed to hate speech to be posted will eliminate hate speech altogether. This can be done by a computer bot as it would be humanly difficult to monitor flooding comments.
__label__Position	Having a bot reduce hate speech again would need to be programmed by a human, this human would need to be in an unbiased position to do this. In this day an age it very challenging.
__label__Position	Hate speech allows factors such as race and racism to come into play https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea
__label__Position	Freedom of speech doesn't equal to freedom of consequences. Hate speech entails inciting violence and hatred towards often already disenfranchised groups of people; it's not done in the spirit of good faith discourse. Hate speech doesn't need to be platformed. Either eliminate the comments section or moderate it heavily.
__label__Position	As already demonstrated by other bigger social media companies, algorithms often contain and reinforce the negative biases of its creators, so I'm not sure how effective they would be in detecting and filtering out hate speech.
__label__Support	I totally agree. Freedom of speech is very important, but if it goes too far and it becomes online harassment, then it's time to treat it as a criminal offence.
__label__Support	What more is there to say? Online hate speech does breed violence, whether that of self-inflicyion or harm to others. And so yes, this extreme freedom of speech has to be curtailed. Many countries have already enforced strict monitoring of forums and news article comment sections to prevent disastrous outcomes.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	This will go against the purpose of public opinion. Public opinion is informative and sometimes educational
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	In my opinion, yes, its normal to say what you are thinking as long as you dont harm anyone in any way sow yes silencing its needed.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.

__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Support	I also agree with this position. letting people fully express themselves will fully enable sourcing The root of the problem
__label__Support	Disagreeing with someone doesn't mean that I want to fight them, it means we have opposing opinions, so I think it's totally possible to disagree in a subtle manner.
__label__Support	I think this is good and supports freedom of speech, but at the same time, we cant really control "aggressiveness" in people especially considering that the degreees of acceptable aggressiveness varies with each person
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Support	But have you considered which one has more serious effects and consequences? I think that should be guiding in the main argument on whether to allow commenting or allow hate speech
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information.

__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	I agree
__label__Position	There should be people assigned to go over the comments provided in order to ensure that the final approved posts do not contain hate speech. Basically a team set up to censor comments accordingly
__label__Position	I agree that discussions should be moderated. But what happens when the moderators themselves are biased?
__label__Position	Another option would be for newspapers to introduce a "report" button so that readers can report hate speech. These comments can then be reviewed by the newspaper's in house "hate speech control" team.
__label__Position	I also think that fully restricting hate speech infringes on the right to freedom of speech, yet fully understand that there is a very thin line that can be crossed with freedom of speech which allows people to fully and unfiltered(ly) express themselves, and hate speech which has waaay more damaging effects
__label__Position	I think most of us share a unanimous idea which is that restricting the comments section is not so beneficial in the long run, and that internal measures can be taken to deal with the issue of hate speech . This article shows how hate speech can be effectively tackled https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/impact-and-prevention/why-tackle-hate-speech
__label__Position	I fairly believe that the biggest issue at hand is the meaning behind freedom of speech and hate speech. Whenever people do post or write things that are hate speech, they hide behind the principle of freedom of speech. Newspapers and websites must be able to monitor and get opinions from the public about what to remove. Comment sections are really important to socialize and allow thought-provoking questions and ideas.
__label__Position	I still maintain, comment sections should stay. Hate speech CAN and should be filtered. Read up more on this topic: https://www.techdirt.com/2021/11/08/killing-website-comment-sections-wasnt-brilliant-move-many-newsroom-leaders-assumed/
__label__Position	Policing the comments section by the newspaper does run the risk silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech, but law-abiding and Nobel citizens wont shy away from engaging in the topics, its only those ill-mouthed readers who will run that risk.policing the comments sections should be mandatory because if its not in place, they run the risk of losing readers due to them feeling unsafe and not protected
__label__Position	I strongly believe that removing the readers' comment space will be depriving readers of expressing themselves, hence stopping freedom of speech. Imagine if you saw something about yourself in the newspaper that was totally incorrect, would you let that slide? I want to be able to comment on everyday things but I'm not for hate speech. That means that there needs to be some monitoring that has to be made.
__label__Position	policing the comments section for hate speech is very much possible and can be effective. we cannot allow hate speech to prevail while its having a negative impact on people and there measures which we can put in place. take a look at this article attached with a link https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons
__label__Support	I completely agree - I frequently don't comment because I expect that I will accidently unleash an off-topic argeument by people who just want to cause trouble.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Attack	This might negatively affect the person/ people in the articles.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Attack	I disagree. Would you like to read a newspaper filled with hate speech just because they are not in charge of identifying what is hate speech or not?
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.

__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Attack	Who and what would be classed as a less strict criteria?
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Attack	Exactly the newspapers must be the place to comment because they give us the article but this article is written by a journalist. Therefore, the article represent the ideas of the journalist. Not all the time they are neutral. Sometimes they are even politically influenced. This often provokes discussions and where else can people say their opinion if there is no comment section?
__label__Support	This is very true and I think that by focusing on educating others before they decide to give an opinion as most hate speech is just a form of ignorance from others.
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Attack	prevents people being upset,
__label__Support	moderator could remove the part of sentence and not the whole post instead, so that the entire post is not unreadable, the person could have a valid point, just not written it in a better way,
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people.

This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Support	comments don't need to involve hate speeck, one can comment without using these types of expressions,
__label__Support	I agree with this however sometimes 'hate speech' can be subjective between different people. You have your clear and obvious examples of hate and some comments can be up for opinion
__label__Position	In my opinion the comment section should not be removed. I personally get very annoyed if I watch or read something and want to express my opinion, then go down to the comment section to sadly find out the comments are turned off. This limits the freedom of speech and blocks the ability for the people to vent out somehow. I think this builds aggression and causes problems afterwards. The better thing to do is to limit bad speech, foul words and cursing but removing the comments completely is not a good idea.
__label__Position	We live in a democratic society and so people have the right to their opinions. They just need to be voiced in the right way
__label__Attack	Not necessarily. I think opinions are okay but not when it is hate and discrimination. Thinking morally that is wrong and shouldn't be allowed on any type of platform.
__label__Position	The creation of a safe space within the comments section run by moderators around the clock with the assistance of software that roots out keywords that could be hate speech and a swift report and block system to deny access to people violating the rules
__label__Position	If the information is accurate and the facts are accurate.
__label__Position	I disagree with the idea that hate speech is free speech as nothing that perpetuates targetted violence should be done freely without consequence.People on the internet need to watch what they say the same way they would when engaged in a conversation in the real world.For those that choose to not adhere it is imperative that they are removed from these platforms and banned from creating other accounts.
__label__Position	If the truth is exposed and there is transparency.
__label__Position	In summary most of the points made regarding the elimination of hate speech were very insightful and some were really good ideas. The idea to have users flag bad comments and they be hidden and later checked by moderators was a great idea, another good idea was to help make people aware of the impact hate speech causes to some individuals.
__label__Position	By the whole nature of the newspapers removing this ability, who is to say the newspaper itself could be potentially spreading hate news?
__label__Attack	but the newspaper cannot be liable for how people respond,considering that most website are visited by adults with responsibilities.
__label__Position	Some words could be put in the software and removed or censored when detected. This is not too hard to be done and will not eliminate the freedom of speech.
__label__Position	I believe a mixture of AI, and human moderation is needed to help the situation. Comments are needed in newspaper websites.
__label__Position	Nowadays everything is possible on the internet. The comment sections must exist and limit the bad language. There are so many options and software the moderators can use. There is very good explanation about the profanity filters in the following article: https://www.spectrumlabsai.com/profanity-filters There is also VPN filters and so on, the computer systems offer so many options for everyone. We should not just give up and remove something that can exist with the right IT.
__label__Position	https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation This is a good summary of the position I hold.
__label__Position	https://www.e-marketingassociates.com/blog/the-importance-of-monitoring-social-media-comments - This stresses the importance of monitoring comments as it has both positives for us and positives for these newspaper companies. Not only does hate crime harm individuals but it can harm the business who allow hate crime to be associated with their platform. It is necessary and okay for people to have opinions however morally we should draw a line and know where we stand on right and wrong
__label__Position	I was reading through an article called Thou Shalt Not Hate: Countering Online Hate Speech and it summarized my view quiet fairly on the topic. https://ojs.aaai.org//index.php/ICWSM/article/view/3237/3105
__label__Position	https://www.unia.be/en/areas-of-action/media-and-internet/internet/how-to-deal-with-hate-speech
__label__Position	I think assertive responses in thee comment section can help with fairly reducing hate speech - allowing everyone the opportunity and right to have an opinion without attacking them and being open to ideas that you may not have considered, or may not personally align to you.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	something needs to be done about 'hate speech' so moderators would be a good idea,
__label__Support	freedom of speech needs to be maintained whilst making sure other people's rights are not violated and people do not have to read 'hate speech' which is offensive to them personally,
__label__Attack	Who deems whether criticism is valid or invalid in this situation? I guess there will always be conflicting opinions and ideas, but over policing of this may not be the solution to managing hate speech.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	I think by promoting the hate speech it very much takes away the meaning of the subject. You dont need to be hateful to agree/disagree with something. You can be constructive in your approach and this will have a greater impact on the issue and cause for a logical debate between people. So an element of policing is required
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Attack	This isnt a freedom of speech issue. That is only in relation to the govt not curtailing free speech. A private company... newspaper, has no obligation to allow you to freely air your views.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Support	It is a nice explanation
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Support	I feel newspapers don't work well and an interactive medium anyway. "letters to the editor" might be an avenue
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	Personal data is very sensitive and could be used by social media owners
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	I disagree that newspapers should be one-sided providers. Newspapers are often aligned to certain political parties, and that is not necessarily made clear! Readers may not realise they are reading biased news stories. Comments should be allowed so that alternative points of view can also be aired.
__label__Position	Comment spaces should be moderated, perhaps even approved before posting.
__label__Support	This would be an effective measure in preventing hate speech from being published.
__label__Position	I feel like this is definitely the way to go about this. I don't think taking away the comment space is the most ideal option as it feels as if your voice is being taken away. There needs to be more things in place to ensure people's safety. It's a sad world we live in these days that people feel the need to comment hate towards others.
__label__Position	A moderated comments section can solve this problem. Freedom of speech does not need to include hate speech. An opinion can be given that doesn't include hate speech in it.
__label__Support	Yes, people need to be held acountable for their actions.
__label__Support	Strongly agree, people who are expressing their fear of censorship should consider the risks that hate speech create for groups of people. https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech
__label__Position	It hink a moderation is required for hate speech. Removing the entire comment section is not an ideal option. However, hate speech is alsoa crime. It is clear that there should be some monitoring in social media in terms of tracking down the user when necessary so similar terms with the real world would be valid. If you make a crime in real word you get you will stand trial so similar option should be valid for social media.
__label__Position	I think online newspaper shouldn't remove the comment space from their platform. I think everyone should follow rules do reduce hate speech. Every comment should be moderae.
__label__Position	I think that people need to take a deeper look into the amount of hate speech that actually occurs online. We need to start at the root of the problem. Check out some informatiion from Stop Hate UK.. https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/what-is-online-hate-crime/
__label__Position	I think it should have rules when commenting in a online newspaper and also should have option to report comments that doesn't follow the rules
__label__Position	I think removing the entire comment section is not a solution because hwen people do domething bad we cannot ban the entire platform. If people are stealing money we cannot close all the banks. We can try to reduce the robbery!
__label__Position	It seems like the only option is intervention on the newspapers part. If they don't want it to be the wild west, they'll have to put measures in place to control the rhetoric. There are many options like moderators, auto-mods or bots, required account registration, and removal of comments and users who violate the rules. Ultimately there are many options with costs associated with them, it's up to the newspapers to decide what is best for their platforms.
__label__Support	AI is a great option that would reduce the need for manpower and increase the efficiency and speed in which hate speech is addressed.
__label__Attack	AI unfortunately does inherit the biases of it's creators and is by no means a perfect solution.
__label__Attack	AI could end up preventing speech that does not qualify as hate speech.
__label__Attack	I've seen it work well, but the algorithm needs to be somewhat transparent
__label__Position	I think action needs to be taken no matter what. Leaving a comment section open without any measures to combat hate speech is not a viable option. Based on this article, if left unchecked it can lead to real world violence, https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/11/30/how-online-hate-speech-is-fueling-real-life-violence/
__label__Position	Being and advocate of freeing people from hate speech or reducing the verbal abuse that happens on the internet is not necessarily advocating against freedom of speech. As much as there should be freedom of speech people should also be free from abuse. The safety of people should be a priority. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-020-03737-6
__label__Position	Not really.. bad actors will find ways around any limitation.. AI might prevent direct hate speech, but then the various movements will use codes instead
__label__Position	create an algorithm that identifies hate speech and removes it
__label__Attack	the software might fail
__label__Position	It is obvious that something needs to be put in place to reduce online hate speech in comment sections. The below article shows how this can manifest as realworld hatred and violence. Surely newspapers have the obligation to step up and do something about this. https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/11/30/how-online-hate-speech-is-fueling-real-life-violence/
__label__Position	This isnt a freedom of speech issue. That only related to public, not private entities. A private company can prevent you from voicing your opinion on their platform for any reason. i think hate speech is probably the best reason a private company can give in this respect. https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/about-educational-outreach/activity-resources/what-does
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	I think it is a good idea to be able to flag the comment so moderators can review it
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Support	i agree with this one
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them.

__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	i think one can filter the comment so that only the comment that show love are seen by people
__label__Support	one of the few comments i agree with
__label__Position	We should not hide opinions but a general respect should be lined out in rules of comments, where no hate speech or prejudice should be allowed. People should still be given a voice to speak on topics with respect to every other human being and this should be monitored by the platform from preventing any prejudice that could be commented. I ultimately think there should still be a comment section for all people, but within a controlled environment on the platform.
__label__Position	I think that automatic tools like filters are a good idea but too prone to error. Harmless words might accidentally be filtered out and those using hate speech are usually wise to this and learn how to manipulate their words or spelling to bypass filters. A moderation policy implemented by a human moderator still seems like the best response to me.
__label__Position	after going through other peoples positions i can say the filtering of hate comments might no be hundred percent effective but i still recommend it. i think the newspaper will not be nice without the interaction between the audience and the writer.
__label__Position	At the end of the day hate speech is not hate speech to everyone, I ended up reaching the conclusion that everyone has their own opinion about everything, So to want to filter or block comments is not freedom of speech, but building a sensitive society that is scared of debates and confronting serious issues, Its up to the receiver of the comment to act on it or not. Cyber bullying is a different story.
__label__Attack	People can have constructive debates and confront serious issues without using hate speech. Filtering hate speech will not stop debates.
__label__Position	Freedom of speech is important, people must be allowed to express their views about social issues that affect them, but it must not infringe on anyone's right either. The solution is to filter comments that contain hate speech
__label__Position	i disagree with the comment of there not being a comment section. what about people who genuinely want to ask a question or leave serious feedback?
__label__Position	Hate speech is always misinterpreted by very sensitive people who don't like to confront certain major issues , especially if these issues are personal to them.
__label__Position	The first position is that readers comments must be filtered to remove any comments that contain hate speech. The second position is that filtering comments is in itself an infringement of freedom of speech, and that people should be free to express themselves the way they want to. The bottom line is that readers get a chance to express their opinions in the comments section and tackle social issues but it should not be done in a way that will hurt other people in any way. The comments section encourages healthy engagement and debate.
__label__Attack	The newspapers aren't reading consumer input though. The only people reading the comments section are other consumers. The only purpose they serve is announcing your views to everyone else reading the same article. It's unnecessary and people's opinions are rarely changed by what they read in the comments section from some random reader/commenter.
__label__Position	i Think people who believe the comment section should be removed should read this article. https://www.techdirt.com/2021/11/08/killing-website-comment-sections-wasnt-brilliant-move-many-newsroom-leaders-assumed/
__label__Position	Comments sections should certainly not be removed, but certain words may be filtered if there is strong hate
__label__Position	In Gentzkow and Shapiro's (2011) study, 55% of the web traffic of the progressive New York Times was from political conservatives. This suggests that the people who are most likely to comment hold strong views, which they may express strongly.
__label__Position	There should be automatic filters but they are not 100, so there should also be a team of people constanly monitoring and reviewing complaints and reports. I feel like it is the only way to keep the freedom of speech but also protect people who might be victims of it.
__label__Support	"However, the accuracy of content moderation when it comes to subjective concepts is better maintained by human moderators." https://www.op360.com/ai-vs-human-content-moderation/
__label__Position	removing a comments section isn't hindering free speech. You still have the freedom to make your own post about the topic, you can even share the article in question that you would have commented on. There are still social media groups in which you can discuss your views openly. The media source that posted the article isn't reading and responding to the comments section so there is no point in a comments section except for random people to argue or agree with each other.
__label__Position	Comments sections should be removed. They serve two purposes, echo chambers and arguing. Few people ever change their opinions based on the comments section of a news article. People who feel the need to announce their views on a public forum and demand everyone agree with them is a running trend. When someone doesn't agree and dares to voice an opposiing opinion the conversation can quickly devolve into name calling and personal insults. While this behavior doesn't always fall into the category of hate speech it is still toxic, damaging, and all too common. https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation

__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.

__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Support	setting a team aside to check for hate speech is the solution and removing it
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Attack	All in all, the newspaper comment section should not be cancelled.
__label__Support	I totally disagree with this, If the newspaper is not the place for comments then where would they get the platform to voice out their convictions
__label__Support	It is politically incorrect to defy people their freedom of speech.
__label__Support	I think people are completely aware that they are spouting 'hate' messages, they just don't care. Education is a total waste of time. They are bullies.
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Attack	This is a fine point. Though if I take a more literal stance, this kind of deletion wouldn't happen as the moderators wouldn't accept it in the first place? If they did decide to remove posts afterwards, the interference may become more and more common, resulting in a news publisher that is increasingly political - something you'd want to avoid on a platform that gives people a range of speech and perspectives.
__label__Support	Perhaps this would put too much power in the hands of arbiters. But if those who partake in submitting 'hate' comments were to be traced, they should end up in the Courts, not be 'educated'.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?

__label__Position	creating standards in which comments are allowed that allow for different opinions to be expressed but for that to be done respectfully. A personalised system that would remove hate comments that should be set using a certain standard to measure what qualifies as hate speech.
__label__Attack	if one matter is not given enough attention than that would have bad consequences as if might not reach a lot of people
__label__Support	not giving much attention to certain issues can lessen hate speech
__label__Position	the should be strong monitoring and assessments before news is published .
__label__Position	i think one of the best ways is to allow everyone a free space of commenting yet making sure that all the hate speech is automatically blocked no one can see those comments except the administrator
__label__Position	I think that what people comment should be monitored, we cannot allow people to celebrate racism, homophobia and fatphobia all in the name of free speech.
__label__Position	State that the editor is free to print or not print any comments, and his/hers is the final decision.
__label__Support	does not have too many problems with the company
__label__Position	hate speech shouldnt be eliminated because some mewspaper online post fake news so when people comment whatever they want it helps all of us a freedom of choice
__label__Position	State that the editor has the final choice to print or not.
__label__Position	Control what is printed or posted to make sure that it is diverse and does not contain any hate speech but the message they are trying to get across they are able to. That way newspaper can leave the comment section and different opinions are heard and expressed and no one gets hurt.

__label__Support	However it's more likely that enough people will visit a website, and that there will be enough diverse opinions that the extreme ones (those looking for the argument and attention even) won't have to be given emphasis. So yes, I think your idea works well.
__label__Position	create a team of people that can look for and remove the hate speech and leave all other respectful arguments to make the comment section diverse.
__label__Position	I think that, no matter the time cost, this is an essential step in the right direction. Technology is so advanced, I'm sure we can keep the readers comments sections while monitoring and dealing with hate speech.
__label__Position	Many publications in the US media have shut off comments sections and are doing this because they believe that whilst it possibly spreads hate speech, it also has the ability to spread "fake news" or skew readers away from the facts contained in the articles. You can read more about it here: https://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-09/why-were-shutting-our-comments/

__label__Support	Again, good point. Maybe there should be a daily limit on how many posts can be removed? (In order to avoid publishers becoming reliant on retrospective fixing, rather than their initial checks - which are where the problem originates).
__label__Attack	it would take a lot of time before the news are released
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.

__label__Support	there is no hate speech
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Hate speech is not free speech when it can lead to attacks on people and how they choose to live their lives.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	there would be no hate speech
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Attack	Lack of accuracy due to reliance on tech, opportunities to get past algorithm
__label__Attack	this article : https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/830/3/032006 indicates that the algorithm that is considered to be the best for removing hate speech is still only just over 71% effective. This still leaves a lot of room for error.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Attack	peoples' opinion on the internet tend to be more extreme in general due to anonymity. I doubt not letting them comment will make it any worse
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Attack	The removal of the comment gives a clear warning to contributors that hate speech is not tolerated and that if they use offensive language then their opinion will not be heard.
__label__Support	there is need of moderators so people know they are being monitored and they can behave themselves also a filtering of swear words would help
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	More emphasis on moderation of specific language would reduce the risk of hate speech. Also, moderators approving comments before they appear on the website would help.
__label__Support	This could work
__label__Position	Removing the comment facility in no way infringes free speech. The content providers, newspapers, are at liberty to provide discussion space or not as they see fit. The use of a moderator might be useful but this seems a great investment of time to little effect. There are obviously those who enjoy using comment spaces to express extreme and unthought out opinions as well as to insert hate speech. Perhaps only those who have subscribed to a news source should be allowed to comment.
__label__Support	Newspaper websites may remove comment areas if they wish. Having moderators or allowing only subscribed comments are also options that may work. They just have to be careful on who decides what is hate speech and what is fair comment.
__label__Position	We need to let people have their opinions spoken. Removing the comment space is not a good option. Instead, we need to better educate people on what's good and what's bad.
__label__Support	so moderators and filters are needed
__label__Position	I incline to the opinion that it is almost impossible to elimate hate speech from such comment sections without elaborate checking systems and that these are not worth the trouble. There I think the best solution is to remove the comment sections altogether. What useful purpose do they actually serve? None I would suggest. I doubt if the newspaper editors or journalists pay much heed to the views expressed therein and I'm sure that politicians and powers that be don't.
__label__Position	While I understand people's points on censorship and freedom of speech, I do wonder to what extent do we allow "freedom of speech." Is someone else's freedom to feel safe, secure, etc. not worth as much as someone's freedom of speech? These are the types of arguments that hate speech brings up, and I would encourage you all to reflect on that as well.
__label__Support	All very good and valid points, i am in total agreement with PriceP. Very well put.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should not take away the comment section. Firstly this is unfair to all the people who want to have their say and should be able to do so Dominicis wrong
__label__Position	It is not fair if newspapers take away the comment space. I do not consider this to be fair choice in a supposed democratic society/
__label__Support	I agree, it is just what I said.
__label__Position	I think in order to eliminate hate speech, the comment section itself must be completely eradicated to take a way all potential risk. Newspapers have the sole purpose of giving accurate depictions of current events, there is no responsibility for them to offer social commentary space. One only has to look at the hatred filled comments of the Daily Mail web pages to see the concerning language being used on a regular basis.
__label__Attack	I don't think we should rely on AI or algorithms to safeguard comment sections. Algorithms are only as reliable as the coding, and that is done in total darkness.
__label__Position	According to this article, self-regulation is considered to be an effective tool for filtering hate speech on newspaper websites with moderations https://zdjp.si/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/poyhtari.pdf
__label__Position	As I said before, using the AI is a good option for filtering comments. According to this article https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0163443720957562, moderators have difficulties separating "uncivil speech" so I think we need to use AI to filter comments.
__label__Support	involved
__label__Attack	It would require more time and effort
__label__Position	Have something that sensors specific hate words and filter them out
__label__Attack	word filters can be circumvented, for example by replacing one or more letters with a number or asterisk. The filter would not remove the offensive word but it would still be clear to readers what word was being used.
__label__Position	Put a trigger warning on the paper advising readers to not read ahead because the content might be offensive. Also having filters so certain words
__label__Attack	there would have to be agreement across all platforms regarding which words were filtered out. It is possible that a simple computer algorithm might let through an offensive word where a letter has been replaced by a number and filter out inoffensive words by taking them out of context.
__label__Position	On the other hand, people have the right to not receive unnecessary hate on the internet by trolls. https://www.journalofcommunication.ro/index.php/journalofcommunication/article/view/322 this study shows that hate speech online has a negative effect on lgbt people. People shouldn't be subjected to discrimination for their sexual orientation or race ect. Maybe censor words that offend protected classes? women, lgbt, minorities ect.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	This is a great idea balances everything
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	well that would affect the credibility of the newspaper and reputation so yes it is a big responsibility to maintain spaces civilised
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	I think people may give false information (data)
__label__Support	https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements/2022/06/role-education-address-root-causes-hate-speech-and-advance-inclusion-non
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	ALthough the idea of free speech is important, it cannot be used as an excuse to upset others and use racist/sexist/ violent language.
__label__Position	Newspaper comment spaces allow people the opportunity to share their opinions and feel that they can contribute their thoughts and ideas - it can also help readers engage with the content in a different way.
__label__Attack	Discrimination may divide readers
__label__Position	It is too easy for people to use the term 'free speech' and how it is a fundamental right, when really they are using it to excuse 'hate speech' which should never be tolerated. There are other ways that people can share their ideas in a respectful way.
__label__Position	i totally agree
__label__Position	This should be a priority, some hate speech is not necessary
__label__Support	we should be able to share love, this world needs that
__label__Position	Thank you for this!, this is a great idea
__label__Support	this is beautifully written, it should be a priority
__label__Position	Removing the comment section all together is a fair point as news is meant to be fair and impartial. People share their opinions based on their biases and that's not what the news is for - that's what social media is for. But in this case allowing the comment section to remain would be great if people would not abuse the power to share freely by sharing hate speech and slander. us as humans need to be regulated by a set of rules in order to keep a functioning society and i think a filtered comment section is the solution.
__label__Attack	By total scrapping of the comment section, reporters might get away with misinforming the public therefore they need to be called out right on the spot but in a respectful manner.
__label__Support	Regulation of the comment section will definitely help reduce the hate speech
__label__Position	having a moderator would be the best way to go around this, or even a team of moderators would do
__label__Position	Newspapers should definitely not censor users but should come up with other measures to restrict users with malicious intent. Such mechanisms can be only registered users being allowed to comment and for the comments to be public. Mechanisms such as AI bots which trace keywords that promote hate speech can be utilised by newspaper agencies.
__label__Position	Joseph Raised a powerful point that there are a few ways to reduce hate speech without eliminating reader's comments. They spoke on a point that stood out to be about having a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or dissaproving comments before they are posted to the public. although this might default on the topic of freedom of speach.

__label__Position	Removing the comment space will take away the readers and users freedom of speech and the right to engage on the current affairs which give the newspaper ultimate power without any consequences.
__label__Position	This is a complicated topic with no easy answers. I think it is reasonable for each website to have their own company policy that discourages hate speech on their platform. This could be achieved via human or algorithmic checking, the blanket ban of certain words and phrases, or some form of community accountability that downvotes or reports certain comments.
__label__Position	After reading of many comments my position remains largely the same. However, I do concede that it is difficult knowing where to draw the line between reasonable and unreasonable forms of censorship. To counteract this, I believe websites should have to be really transparent about what types of comments they do and don't allow on their platform and why.
__label__Position	As the comments are read by human beings, their opinion and/or bias come into play when the comments are posted. This can therefore bring ambiguity to the comments posted depending upon who is reading/approving them.
__label__Position	I found this really interesting, "Khan said the freedom of opinion and expression, including the right to seek, receive and disseminate diverse sources of information, must be upheld by States in times of crises and armed conflict as a precious ‘survival right’ on which people’s lives, health, safety, security and dignity depend." This is similar to what lots of people have been saying regarding worrying that this sort of censorhip could overextend. (https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/10/protect-freedom-expression-vital-survival-right-civilians-armed-conflict-un)
__label__Support	Some of the thoughts that people need to 'clear' may offend others.
__label__Position	Here is another example of this sort of censorship overextending in the case of Facebook - Facebook has worked with Pakistani government to censor "blasphemous" pages and speech inside Pakistan, censoring 54 posts in the second half of 2014.[11] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_by_Facebook#:~:text=Facebook%20has%20been%20involved%20in,demands%2C%20and%20government%20censorship%20laws.)

__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	Moderators need to act quickly to remove any hate speech
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	I think it would just become full of comments from people who were writing things just to get a reaction - feeding the trolls!
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Support	It should be done like a spam filter
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree. However, policies that educate people on how to deliver their speech is imperative
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Support	I also agree because reading what people thinks about your work or your outlet is important. if not then how could the writer improve?
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Support	i agree that it can help develop a story and provide or increase the information around it from people who know more
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people.

__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	It would reduce hate comments to the max.
__label__Support	It would also not allow the writer to see if the public like what he/she is writing.
__label__Attack	But a negative comment is not bad especially if what was done deserves to reprimanded.
__label__Attack	And who would be removing these comments and how do we know that they do not have other motivates behind trying to remove the comment.
__label__Position	I think by monitoring messages it would keep hate speech down. It's hard to say if a computer would successfully filter out everything, but it would definitely reduce the problem.
__label__Position	I think if all comments go under review for hate speech, that should still allow a chance for hate speech comments to be retracted
__label__Support	Comments are still there for free speech.
__label__Position	Pros
__label__Attack	It is an easy programming process to do so.
__label__Position	Having a screaning for all comments before they go up on the platform to make sure that they are not posted on the site.
__label__Support	Thats a reasonable idea however, there needs to updates that automatically flag out inappropriate comments
__label__Position	Removing the comment section from online newspapers is not the answer. Allowing people to post their opinions is healthy and a normal part of human society- people will not always agree. However, in order to reduce hate speech, which can so often lead to crime, it could be done so that there are monitors (either human or computer) who check comments before they are posted to ensure they are not hate speech.
__label__Position	by providing some form of censorship on the comments put up
__label__Position	I firmly think that removing the comment section is inappropriate as people have a freedom of speech however, certain systematic updates should be installed that filter out or flag the hate comments. If the comment is found to be hate speech it will notify the sender and not publish the comment to keep the flow of the conversation.
__label__Position	It is important to put attention to the fact that comments should not be randomly and uncontrollably censored since every person has the right to freely express themselves (https://rm.coe.int/16800c170f). Current algorithms are effective, but not 100% flawless in detecting hate speech and therefore should be optimized and can be used as a tool to eliminate hate speech on newspaper websites (https://ieai.sot.tum.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Research-Brief_Intervening-Against-Online-Hate-Speech_April2022_FINAL.pdf).
__label__Position	publisheres need to employ the services of fact checking before information goes online. this will discourage those who know they are lying from putting up false views. it has become simple to verfiy information online and this should be done for onlline comments too. https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/take-action/engage?gclid=Cj0KCQjw48OaBhDWARIsAMd966Ayc9p2D7Wmx7rju0OpfXpfBTAvnesQI0PzhoqZlJRK--8r2H-fZAQaAsIoEALw_wcB

__label__Support	I agree that Comments should we posted then flagged by the public. If it has a certain number of flags it should then be reviewed. This is good as it is up to the public if they find a comment to be hate speech and t is not just up to one person as people have issues being impartial. https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/alternative-truths/201006/the-persistent-illusion-impartiality
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.

__label__Attack	However some people might argue that what they said is not hate speech, and that the newspaper is trying to censor their opinion
__label__Support	There should already be policies that hinder hate speech as it seems that the problem is escalating
__label__Attack	I think it is part of the responsibility of having a website. If the newspaper is not listed as a +18 platform for using insults or hate speech, then young people would be affected.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	It risks depressing people
__label__Support	It helps people reflect on the news
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Support	There is no way to restrict speech without censorship...so remove the option to comment rather than to censor.
__label__Attack	I believe if almost everyone who knows about hate speech will know what to say and what not to say.
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Attack	bit over stated
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people.

__label__Attack	This seems to have a slippery slope for restricting opinions.
__label__Attack	Hunting people down for their opinions is too much like big brother/censorship!
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	The newspaper has the duty of educating and informing the public. One-sided articles should not be allowed as they fail to give a full perspective and may even spread misinformation, if there commenters are not allowed to correct or add a new perspective.
__label__Attack	Banning comment section is not a solution at all, the ban of comment sections is also the ban of freedom of speech/ opinions over all. The idea behind comment sections is for readers to share their different thoughts regarding the News with each other which is very important.
__label__Attack	Th Un have argued that we need to address hate crime https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech
__label__Position	We can reduce hate speech by regulating comments that are attacking a certain group with no true basis or facts
__label__Attack	Hate speech an be considered a form of verbal assault. Why should we accept that?
__label__Position	I think everyone agrees here that comment regualtion is necessary.
__label__Position	i feel it definitely stifles peopls opinions. Everyone should be given the freedom to state their stance on a particular opinion of theirs. This is called censoring.
__label__Position	Raising awareness and having community standards that are against hate speech might
__label__Position	I do not think it is possible, in a fair and just way. When speech is restricted that's called censorship. Who would justify the restrictive opinion?
__label__Support	People will say whatever they want even mean things and say it is free speech.People should learn to be kind to others without using free speech as an excuse
__label__Attack	This argument doesn't consider the ways in which certain kinds of speech can suppress other kinds of free speech. If hate speech is allowed to run rampant, this silences and threatens minority speech out of existence.
__label__Position	85% of hate crimes are against groups that cannot change their identity. That's ethnicity/race, gender, sexuality and disability. These groups should not be verbally assulted for what they cannot change about themselves. https://www.justice.gov/hatecrimes/hate-crime-statistics
__label__Attack	not well explained
__label__Position	The newspapers should encourage the victims of hate speech to report hate speech published, establish monitoring and evaluation units in newsrooms. Some units should be tasked with monitoring hate sppech trends, compiling reports and bringing these to the attention of key institutions
__label__Position	The newspapers should encourage the victims of hate speech to report hate speech published, establish monitoring and evaluation units in newsrooms.

__label__Attack	Tasking whole units with not only moderation of hate speech but also tracking it and analysing it for trends is a huge additional workload for an already stretched sector. It sounds great, but likely unrealistic in terms of newspaper resources.

__label__Attack	not focusing on the interconnection between free speech and hate crime
__label__Position	Poor argument
__label__Position	I'm not sure I agree with the characterisation by others here of removing comment sections on newspapers being censorship or removal of free speech. People are still able to express their opinions on the news without those opinions being actively published by the newspaper via the comment section. They can simply share on their own social media channels for example, and express their opinions there. I think if newspapers do not have the resources to moderate comment sections, this is a fair choice to make. However overall I think that larger newspapers who can sustain a moderation team have been successful in filtering out hate speech while still giving readers the opportunity to discuss and comment.
__label__Position	Studies are indicating that comments on news articles can colour readers' perception of the article's content itself. By including unmoderated comment sections that can be full of hate speech and misinformation, journalists could actually be said to be reneging on their main responsibility -- which is not to elevate the speech of others, but to report on the news factually and objectively. https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/internet-comments-and-perceptions-of-quality/371862/
__label__Position	Many are saying that any form of moderation or removing comment sections is censorship, and that hate speech is just an inevitable fact of life, but moderating hate speech is arguably key to protecting and nurturing free speech. See this argument from the United Nations: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech

Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.

__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Agree with the freedom of speech curtailing. But hate speech can be avoided while also expressing opinions.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Support	We should allow people to discuss their dislike for certain groups but attacking without basis should be condemned.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Attack	It has been normalised that the web is space for hate talk and privacy to say anything, but why did we make this the norm. If it's something you wouldn't say in person then don't say it at all.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__Attack	There are those that are going to use the paltform to
__label__Position	There is a fine line between free speech and hate speech. I don't think there is any way to reduce this because people will take the stand and say that their free speech is being taken away from them.
__label__Position	I think when you report try to be polite and ask yourself what a reader can learn from this.
__label__Attack	But it also means that the newspaper will have full control over what is being posted and can filter certain opinions as well as hate speech to create a biased community look if they want to. Since they would never go on air, there would be no history of the page you can compare to.
__label__Position	Hate speech invites violence and undermines people
__label__Position	Newspaper websites should invest more in technology that can be used to detect hate speech and not allow it to be posted. They should only allow comments posted in the language that the software will understand so that it is able to eliminate hate speech without difficulties. they should also be willing to punish people who post hate speech by reporting them to the authorities.
__label__Attack	but some newspapers will take advantage of readers
__label__Support	that's why I think is important for readers to have a limit on what to say
__label__Position	some words should be muted or not allowed to be used in newspapers, because they are offensive or they contribute to hate speech
__label__Position	some words should be muted or not allowed to be used in newspapers, because they are offensive or they contribute to hate speech
__label__Position	I see a lot of opinions on here that newspaper websites are not responsible to 'police' their platform and that free speech should be allowed. In many parts of the world hate speech and racism are not protected by freedom of speech laws. While I do agree that newspaper websites should allow free discussion and different opinions on their platforms, this does not mean they have to allow hate speech and discriminatory language.
__label__Position	Newspaper websites should also be held accountable if they do not deal with hate speech
__label__Support	This would completely take away the opportunity for these people who use the comment section to post hate speech.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	When moderators have to approve all comments before they get posted you might create an environment where comments the moderator does not agree with do not get posted at all. The better option in my opinion would the second one where you allow readers to flag inappropriate comments, together with a moderator team reviewing these comments. In that case there is a public consensus and more transparency.
__label__Attack	Allowing the readers to push a post out of air by flagging it could be just as easily abused by people to mass flag posts they dont like for political or personal reasons and create more problems than it solves

__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Support	Totally agree with this and hopefully most rational people would.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Attack	I think DominicJ is onto something however with technology being on our finger tips and Artificial intelligence making things easier i think having a software that can be able to restrict those criteria can be a good thing and will be automated
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Attack	I do agree with education and raising awareness but what about bots and people who simply want to cause trouble?
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.

__label__Position	have an AI to scan and analyse trigger words, then the alert is passed to a human reviewer then can say whether or not it's hate speech
__label__Support	not a bad idea
__label__Attack	that isn't bad, but there are some who can run circles around others with their linguistic skills
__label__Position	having a team that monitors people with hate speech might be a great idea however it might not be effective since the number of users can be unknown
__label__Position	We do have to allow people to express their opinions - we can't pretend opinions don't exist. Having them out in the open lets us know what we're dealing with. But at the same time hate speech can't be allowed to flourish and absolutely needs to be challenged. There is a role for AI (which I have said before I know) to try and weed out and remove anything that is just pure hate and not any sort of coherent argument or opinion.
__label__Support	I think an AI could be very useful as well because it would take emotion out of equation when reaching decisions about what speech should be weeded out.
__label__Position	In as much as we can not let the spread of hate speech continue, closing the comment section is not the solution. The newspaper website should have the option for readers to be able to report comments that include hate speech and moderators should be appointed to check "users" that are violating the rules. There can be filters in place that remove posts that have some of the common hateful and derogatory phrases. outlining the rules and regulations for the website users can help
__label__Support	Implementing these can have a favourable outcome.
__label__Position	The newspaper website platform owners should be held accountable for any hate speech that occurs on their website and they can combat hate speech allowing fellow readers to be able to flag/report posts that they deem hateful.The moderators can then investigate.
__label__Attack	I appreciate Twitter is not a news site and this is from the USA where the law is different but it could be a legal minefield: https://news.northeastern.edu/2021/01/12/hate-thrives-on-social-media-but-who-should-police-it/
__label__Position	I think what should be prioritized is the option to let people say their perspective. It is difficult to ensure that no one promotes hate speech, but we should be able to allow people to say what they would like to say, following strict guidelines provided by the website. Are we fighting harm or are we silencing dissent? https://www.ohchr.org/en/stories/2021/07/moderating-online-content-fighting-harm-or-silencing-dissent
__label__Position	The entire nature of human rights standards and principles, as well as the ideals of tolerance, inclusiveness, and diversity, are all denied by hate speech. As a result, it may expose individuals who are the target to exclusion from social and economic opportunities, assault, and other forms of abuse. Expressions of hatred that go uncontrolled can potentially impair societal cohesiveness, peace, and development by creating the conditions for disputes, tensions, and widespread human rights abuses, including atrocity crimes. https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/impact-and-prevention/why-tackle-hate-speech
__label__Attack	Breach of free speech
__label__Position	By eliminating the use of certain words
__label__Support	while I do agree with this, it makes me sad that our society is so soured that people cannot use self control
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks.

__label__Support	I agree with Lawrence we can't give up on the notion that nothing can be, at first we might not get it right but with more options and exploring other things eventually there will be a solution that will prevent users with hate speech from participaating
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Support	I agree 100%. It's too easy to shut down all speech, just because someone gets offended by things that they do not agree with. This will only then attract the bullies and trolls who want to shout down anyone who isn't in lock step with their own narrow viewpoint.
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Support	I agree, everyone has the right to their opinion and to express it
__label__Support	Evidence shows that it is more likely to be a constructive discussion on the newspaper website rather than on Facebook (which is where it would end up if you removed the comments section)
__label__Attack	Bringing Social Media into the discussion is irrelevant in my opinion. We're specifically talking about removing hate speech from newspaper websites. The whole point of social media is to present opinions, share your life etc A newspapers website should be a place for news to be disseminated
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Attack	I disagree, people know the damage but do not care. They hide behind relative anonymity and so do not worry about what people think of their posts. Like many things, you can educate as much as you want but if people choose not to listen it will make no difference
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Support	I agree with the issue of fake news. Readers can find it very difficult to ascertain what is fact and what is fiction online.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	What about free speech?
__label__Position	1. No one should be exempt from the right to free speech
__label__Position	2. We can not dictate how media houses run their operations
__label__Support	This is a good argument, instead of trying to stop free speech altogether rather look to filter out specifically hate speech.
__label__Position	According to newsy.com, between January and March 2022, Meta took action on more than 15 million pieces of hate speech content on Facebook. Roughly 95% of that was detected proactively by Facebook with the help of AI - https://www.newsy.com/stories/artificial-intelligence-is-used-to-track-down-hate-speech/#:~:text=Between%20January%20and%20March%202022,themes%20fall%20through%20the%20cracks.
__label__Support	Do not stop free speech, filter out hate speech!
__label__Attack	It is often very flawed and can flag up false positives
__label__Support	AI can do the work of a very large team
__label__Position	Personally I think it would require a well developed algorithm moderated by a team that updates it regularly to make sure it flags the correct material and continually updates it's database of words, phrases and dogwhistles
__label__Support	may help to maintain a self space
__label__Attack	May be difficult to continuously update adn monitor
__label__Position	My concern is how we efine hate speech vs expressing differing views. However we also have to be aware of the damage publishing incorrect facts can be.
__label__Position	The only way I can see this being done fairly is hiring a software development team/company to develop an algorithm or "Bot" that can be updated with keywords, phrases and common dog whistles used by racists, homophobes, misygonists etc. You would also need a dedicated moderation team that are able to catch anything that slips through the cracks and who are able to understand nuance that a bot could not
__label__Position	Another alternative is to turn our attention towards what 'Free speech' really means and consider re-wording or amending the constitution. This however is requires changes at a government level.
__label__Position	I believe the most appropriate action is to use a combination of computer algorithms and human moderation to monitor and remove hate language. It is important that this doesn't simply become censorship but should be focused on comments that are used to hurt, demean or offend others.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted.

__label__Attack	This seems like agreat idea.
__label__Attack	This is frequently used in social media platforms now, but it can be quite time consuming. Also the tone of a statement can be misinterpreting in text format.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Attack	I think it's a little more nuanced than curtailing freedom of speech. If we define the right to free speech as "the right to speak, write, and share ideas and opinions without facing punishment from the government", you have to consider that news websites and social media are not moderated by the government or required to allow freedom of speech. If a news website is to be truly impartial, I don't personally believe that opinions of the layman provide any benefit and can often be harmful. That however, is only my opinion ;)
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.

__label__Position	We must make sure that we read news from trusted sources only or use reliable social media
__label__Position	Reducing the space reduces the opportunity for free speech and therefore the debate needs to be around whether or not free speech is allowed? Personally, I feel that the newspapers need to carefully regulate what is being published and this includes the comments section.
__label__Position	We must remove that comment before publishing and printing out
__label__Position	We can reduce hate speech by having a team of moderators view the postings before publishing to make sure that there is no hate speech included. Another way is for the readers to flag any hate speech as in appropriate for the moderators to review.
__label__Position	People should be able to regulate their opinions so as to not encourage hateful speech.
__label__Position	As social media have come to dominate socio-political landscapes in almost every corner of the world, new and old racist practices increasingly take place on these platforms. Racist speech thrives on social media, including through covert tactics such as the weaponization of memes (Lamerichs et al. 2018) and use of fake identities to incite racist hatred (Farkas et al. 2018).
__label__Position	Social media contribute to reshaping “racist dynamics through their affordances, policies, algorithms and corporate decisions” (Matamoros-Fernández 2018, 933). I believe the social media contributes in hate speech thatis why people who are respectful expressing their opinions should be considered by signing the consent form. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230&ved=2ahUKEwjLpdz4mu_6AhUmgf0HHSRdCdMQFnoECAwQAQ&usg=AOvVaw29vPxYrjcDX7N5Cfya1-UQ

__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.

__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspapers websites. One way is to create a system where readers can flag articles that contain hate speech. Another way is to have a team of moderators who review articles before they are published.
__label__Position	In recent years, there has been an increase in the amount of hate speech appearing in newspapers and on websites. This has led to calls for action to be taken in order to reduce the amount of hate speech. However, there is a debate about how this can be done without also eliminating space for readers. One proposal is to create a list of words that are considered to be hate speech and to ban these words from being used on newspaper websites. However, this would require newspapers to censor their content and would limit the ability of readers to express themselves freely. Another proposal is to encourage newspapers to moderate their comments sections more carefully. This would involve removing comments that contain hate speech and banning users who repeatedly post such comments. However, this would require a significant amount of resources and may not be feasible for all newspapers. It is clear that reducing the amount of hate speech on newspaper websites is a complex issue.
__label__Position	This is an article on why the UN tackle hate speech and its effects https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/impact-and-prevention/why-tackle-hate-speech
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Attack	The right to free speech doesn't mean there should be no consequences for hate speech.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	The right to free speech doesn't mean there are no consequences for hate speech. Tolerating hate speech is not going to make it go away.
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Attack	Algorithms can be biased, as they are still created by people, and may not be the solution we hope they could. See attached article about racism in hate speech algorithms

__label__Support	I agree. A big importance for newspapers is the comment section and people's opinion to what they have written. Although, the companies should take some responsibility to monitor the comments and what the other users will see.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	I disagree. This limits the freedom of speech of people and for people to be able to give their opinion and potentially challenge the thoughts of the newspaper. I agree that this should be done in a respectful way.
__label__Attack	It's pointless trying to stop people having opinions on the news. If no space to comment is provided people will simply go to other forums to express their views. These communities could be more insular and less moderated, leading to polarisation of views and ultimately breeding extremism.
__label__Position	Comment sections need to be well-moderated, and if algoritmic or user comment flagging is used this needs to also be reviewed by a human moderator to ensure that there is no bias or bad faith reporting going on.
__label__Attack	This is impractical for high traffic websites that will receive thousands of reports

__label__Position	The best solution would be to make people identify themselves to the host of the site, but not publicly unless they give consent. Moderators should be used to ban hate speech.
__label__Support	Freedom of expression is important for ordinary people to express themselves; fight injustice and support marginalised groups. Regimes that depend on achieving and holding power in undemocratic ways see free expression as a threat and restrict or close down the internet.

__label__Support	I agree, this kind of moderation would be helpful
__label__Attack	My concern is that comments could be flagged as inappropriate in bad faith e.g. to shut down the opinions of those people disagree with even if the comments are not inappropriate or hateful
__label__Support	I agree, it may be a better idea to have neutral admin who can monitor comments, rather than the producer of the article or an algorithm.
__label__Support	A combination of volunteer human and algorithm moderation is already used on sites like Reddit. While it's not perfect, it's less rigid than fully automated moderation and allows communities to set their own rules.

__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.

__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	I agree with Andrew. It can also be a form of bullying and those most likely to be affected are the more vulnerable people in society.
__label__Support	Yes RayC. You have a good point there. Hate speech is totally unnecessary - words can HURT!
__label__Attack	I think everyone has a right to freedom of speech, no one should be censored
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.

__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	it would be good to put in place trigger words to help stop hate speech being loaded onto the site.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	This would be removing freedom of speech. I think that is a very problematic road to go down.
__label__Support	I think it is useful to read others opinions & points of view on various topics. It would deny people possible education to take this away.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Support	I totally agree.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Support	We do need to have balance in an argument and allow for free speech to enable all views to be heard and a common good found.
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree with this stance. Based on the evidence provided by research, it is possible to have a balanced discussion on a topic without being aggressive or hateful. Moderation in comments may help with this
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Attack	I am not sure collecting data about the person before posting will help with tracing them down and trying to re-educate them. Just blocking the post and providing a response to them saying their post is not accepted by the platform is more appropriate.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	AI and user moderators can help monitor and regulate harmful comments
__label__Position	To reduce hate speech newspaper websites should employ content moderators who can look out for hate speech and delete it where necessary. This allows for there to still be a comment section for readers to put their opinions in.
__label__Position	Newspaper articles can be very biased based on the views and opinions of the reporter, so a comment section is essential for allowing people to share alternative views and point out biases. Other methods should be found to reduce hate speech in comments, such as moderation or reporting of comments.
__label__Position	My views on this have not changed. A moderated comments section with a flagging system is still a good way of allowing discussion while limiting hate speech.
__label__Position	Considering the arguments and evidence provided by everyone in this discussion, I believe we should somehow find a way to allow people to discuss their opinions (and avoid restricting free speech for the most part), while also protecting people from the potential harms to themselves directly and to and by society by supervising and moderating discussions.
__label__Position	It will only take away a platform for people to post hate speech but it will still exist. perhaps keeping comments might allow open discussion which may impact other peoples thinking and reduce hate speech through debate and education
__label__Position	Hate speech is a problem in a world that is becoming more and more polarised; our basic human rights and freedoms are in jeopardy if we can be subjected to violence just because of our race, gender, sexual orientation... It's important to work on the root of the problem and provide quality education from an early age so that children become more used to diversity. Eliminating space for readers comments won't prevent hate speech from existing, so it's just a patch to a bigger problem.
__label__Support	Not all opinions can be respected, especially those that violate other people's rights and identities.

__label__Position	https://www.prio.org/publications/12392 According to Katrine Fangen and Carina Riborg, people who wrote hate speech comments on the newspapers were people who thought themselves as knowladgeable, so they will go on promoting hatred and spreading their ideas even if we eliminate the section of comments: we have to work on the root of the problem, which is education.

__label__Support	I can agree with this as Newspapers are not government or public services, they are companies trying to sell newspapers and subscriptions to their services for profit, the comments sections are there to bring more revenue into the company and keep more people logged in and using their websites
__label__Position	If a Newspaper wants to allow comments on their site and then they have to expect that hate speech and other negative comments will eventually appear, with this in mind I think moderation (and first line computer based monitoring which can pickup up common words phrases and other easy stuff automatically) has got to be the least they can do, along with making their terms and conditions and other warnings easily visible during registration and prior to posting. Any comments section (of any website, not just newspapers) is a target for negative extreme comments and unfortunately it is part of the Internet in its current form which easily allows anonymity to all who use it.
__label__Position	Also another thought is I am wondering if Newspaper websites are the best place for discussions and comments, after all they are not government or public services, they are companies at the end of the day trying to sell newspapers or subscriptions to their services which increases their profits which it pays to their shareholders. Would a forum type website (like Reddit, or Quora, or maybe something new) be a much better location for these discussions, and by shifting the location to somewhere like this comments and media can be moderated and if anything breaks their rules posts can be removed before it becomes visible?
__label__Position	we need to stop coment section

__label__Support	I like the idea of allowing readers to flag comments for future moderated review :-)
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.

__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Attack	Whoever creates the algorithm then ultimately decides what is hate speech. There need to be a common neutral definition of what hate speech is before any kind of censorship algorithm can be developed.
__label__Support	I do agree partially, that removing the comment section is not the solution. But rather have no comment section than an unregaluted one full of hate speech.

This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Support	it would give focus to the journalism.
__label__Position	Moderation of the comments section
__label__Attack	The content is then controlled by the moderators. How do we ensure that a comment they simply disagree with but still adds to the discussion is let through?
__label__Position	You can let people create an account with a full name so they will have to think more about what they write and can't so easily spew hate
__label__Position	The root cause of most issues is likely from a select few, root out the troublemakers and ban accordingly.
__label__Attack	You have to constantly ban people when they create new accounts
__label__Position	user logins can allow for better regulation of comments
__label__Support	True, creates a hurdle that some people don't wanna do
__label__Position	Allow for a voting system on the comments, so as the cream rises to the top and the dredges sink away.
__label__Attack	It would still need to be moderated as the users can radicalise themselves
__label__Attack	this already exists on certain websites and you can still easily view hateful comments
__label__Position	I think any form of hate speech should be hidden into the sensitivity folder and automatically deleted from the comment section
__label__Position	Limit anonymity in public discussions and employ a system of moderation.
__label__Support	I agree with this comment sections can provide excellent reccomendations, for example: https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/oct/20/steely-dans-20-greatest-songs-ranked
__label__Position	Moderation of both users and comments isn't difficult to implement and will weed out the idiots that want to ruin it.
__label__Attack	I think the fact that Facebook, one of the richest companies in the world, struggle with moderation points to the fact that small local newspapers would struggle. Especially if one of their stores goes viral or something.
__label__Position	You can moderate and that way delete hate speech. This won't get rid of freedom of speech but gets rid of discrimination etc https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech
__label__Position	This is a reasonable response to the issue with a reliable source.
__label__Support	AI could be the first step flagging any potential wording or offensive phrases and a human could doublecheck
__label__Attack	Newspapers should ensure comments are without any form of hate speech to encourage different opinions to be shared.
__label__Attack	Critical discussions are essential to democratic nations
__label__Position	Newspapers are already heavily censored and is not a platform for free speech. Whoever moderates the comments section (be it an algorithm (and by proxy the person creating the algorithm) or a person) will always provide their own bias to the moderation.
__label__Position	Creating algorithms to detect hate speech is not straight forward. There are a lot of types of detection systems/algorithms and each have their own pros and cons. An overview can be found here: https://vitalflux.com/hate-speech-detection-using-machine-learning/
__label__Position	Again, a committee should be set to properly scrutinize the comments before they are uploaded.
__label__Position	Again, a committee should be set to properly scrutinize the comments before they are uploaded.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	Definitely polarised but can't imagine it ending well. You'll just turn it into a hate echo chamber.
__label__Attack	hate speech is a real problem and enabling it to freely exist on the internet can lead to a variety of issues including mental health problems for the person its directed at.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Attack	The law! People break the law through hate speech, so the law needs to be the judge.
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Attack	So because of some people acting like idiots, no one can express their opinion??
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	then you are just living in an echo chamber with no opposing views
__label__Attack	i guess you could pretend that everything is great
__label__Attack	I totally disagree with this because this sounds like a violation of of the human right to freedom of speech. Also, this means that newspapers will be able to get away with publishing articles that the general public does not agree with without any repercussions.
__label__Position	Comments need to be monitored.
__label__Position	by having it monitored and removing hate speech at source
__label__Support	I agree that there should be technologies that are able to scan and the comment section to detect and flag any offensive/derogatory words in the comments before the comments are published.
__label__Position	there must be a code of conduct which is publicly accessible to write a comment. comment themselves could have button on where any other person could consider the comment to behateful with a points system in place
__label__Support	This makes great sense!
__label__Position	comments should be monitored by AI for certain phrases and reactions. A reporting feature can be used to flag posts and remove them either by AI or a real person
__label__Position	i think that in order to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites only people who have purchased a supscription should be allowed to comment that way if they make hateful comments they can be tracked back to the individual
__label__Position	The comment section would need to be monitored, and other readers should be able to report comments
__label__Position	I understand the offer for newspaper websites to not have a comments section as it would mean that there is absolutely no chance for hate speech, using AI is a good suggestion to automatically remove certain words but how can this ensure all hate comments are removed. Perhaps AI monitoring could be used and then have people to also check them
__label__Position	you have to hold people accountable don't let them hide behind anonymous usernames if they are hoing to say hateful things let everyone know the kind of person they are
__label__Position	I like the idea from AndreasS that comments could only be made ny individuals that have a subscription with the newspaper. If there was hate speech they can then be held accountable.
__label__Position	monitoring behaviour is always neccasary - but there needs to some sort of enforment too. some sort of 3 strikes and youre out.
__label__Position	From reader others opinions, it feels like the ability and freedom to comment should not be taken away because of a few people that post troll or hate comments, which means the comment section should stay. But the comments that are posted have to be monitored (maybe by an AI or bot) and also be reportable by other users. I think a fair implementation would be to only allow registered site users to post comments
__label__Position	I think that there should be techologies that are able to scan and the comment section to detect and flag any offensive/vulgar words in the comments before the comments are published.
__label__Position	educate young people on online politeness for want of a better word word have meaning and consequences in the real world and individuals have to take responsibility and not hide behind keyboards
__label__Support	I think you have hit the nail on the head here!
__label__Position	It makes sense to use AI to monitor certain words that are going to cause offence.
__label__Position	websites should also take responsibility and liability for the comments on their sites
__label__Attack	Only allowing paying users might result in the most of the users in a comment section having the same view. For example, many young people do not use newspaper websites. Each comment section might not be diverse at all in type of users or the opinions being shared. Is an echo chamber better, equal to, or worse than a few hate comments?
__label__Position	part of the issue is that heated debate cretes clicks - and newspapers love that esp the red tops. they live off incitement in the first place
__label__Position	A possible con with allowing comments is that it will attract a people with similar views and opinions, leading to an echo chamber. This can be seen in many other social media forums such as Facebook groups, niche Subreddits, etc. Where there can be an almost elitist hierarchy and a lot of gatekeeping. Being the only person with a different view could cause people to leave/stop commenting, leaving only the people who share the same views.
__label__Position	AndreasS said that we should "educate young people on online politeness for want of a better word word have meaning and consequences in the real world and individuals have to take responsibility and not hide behind keyboards" which i believe to be a good point however there will still be times where an educated young person will still hide behind their keyboard and be polite, therefore i agree with his further comments to allow a subscription to ensure those can be named and held accountable however does this limit who has access to giving their comments if you have to buy a subscription and spend money to voice your views? I am for having subscriptions to voice an opinion which can be policed should negative comments be made but it should be made accessible to everyone. A differing opinion would be to completely remove comment sections as AlanU has said however to me this removes platforms for free speech which should be encouraged as long as it is not harming others, therefore in my opinion similarly to what DamianC has said about technologies to scan and detect offensive language. Personally I think a combination with human intelligence would be the best option.

__label__Position	The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is often used as a reason not to have readers comments.

It seems that this is not a fair argument for eliminating readers comments because of the psychological phenomenon of "cognitive dissonance" - we automatically search for echo chambers in any context.
__label__Attack	I think that having these echo chambers just perpetuates what may be a cognitive dissonance, you may not necessarily feel a certain way but a comment you put out may have be interpreted one way and subsequent comments would reinforce that viewpoint in a polarised echo chamber. This website explains it nicely and uses racisms as an example of how cognitive dissonance perpetuates racist behaviour. https://www.reallifepsych.com/single-post/2017/08/16/the-psychology-of-cognitive-dissonance-and-racism
__label__Support	it is true that an echo chamber is inevitable, so
__label__Support	to disallow readers comments is an unnecessary response as these communities can still be found elsewhere
__label__Position	I agree with the article that reducing freedom of speech is not an appropriate response to rising hate speech - filtering the comments via moderation or an algorithm is a way to allow freedom of speech without giving rise to hateful or discriminatory speech.
__label__Position	it is true that is we censor too heavily hate speech that those responsible for initiating these movements will be held less accountable to their words and actions and would be more difficult to identify them and prevent future potentially worse incidents
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Support	We live in a democratic country and so, everyone is entitled to their opinion.
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Attack	The drawback here is that people get carried away and be verbally aggressive and use foul language which doesn't go well with most of the readers who come to view the news and some of the healthy discussions in the comment section. But, all they find it few people engaging in a verbal war which is uncalled for.
__label__Support	Absolutely true. Everyone has freedom of speech. We live in a democratic country where everyone have the right to speak and all voices need to be heard. It is up to the individual to make sure that they put forward their points without being too aggressive and not getting carried away.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Support	I completely agree that education should be involved. The issue is that this doesn't have immediate affects and therefore this is why moderating the comment sections combined with education is key.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	If newspaper columnists can publish their opinions, why can't the public enjoy the same freedoms?
__label__Support	I agree that real time moderation
__label__Position	I believe that with real time moderation , if the comments can be removed before causing any distress to people then this is a better option than removing the ability to make comments.
__label__Position	The best way would be to introduce some kind of moderators who have clear definitions and limitations on what hate speech can be.
__label__Position	I think that only people who provided identifying information can post their opinions. Also I agree that there should be AL tools to prevent hate speech. Eliminating hate speech from newspaper websites has nothing to do with the infringement of the free speech right.
__label__Support	I agree that providing ID could be a way to help with this.
__label__Attack	this is censorship
__label__Attack	I believe the comment space is a place where people get really involved and there is a chance for healthy discussion. However, this is not always the case. Some troublemakers tend to post derogatory statements and use cuss words which is not acceptable. This is a drawback when using the comment section.
__label__Position	One solution to reduce hate speech is by disabling the comment section altogether for most important topics/controversial topics. Yu can actually leave the comment section open for generic topics/non-contoversial topics.
__label__Attack	Controversial topics should be decided on how sensitive the information or event would be to groups that are targeted with hate speech due to protected characteristics e.g race, religion, gender, sexuality etc.
__label__Position	People should be allowed to say what they want. Other people can disagree - they should not allow themselves to be angered by opinions with which they disagree.
__label__Attack	Someone's belief that a marginalised group doesn't deserve rights is far different from having a different opinion on something like the ending of a loved TV show. It should not be the responsibility of those hurt from harmful rhetoric to "be the bigger person" and ignore it when it has been proven that hate speech leads to acts of extreme violence
__label__Position	As I saw some commentary on this platform, my opinion is that we need 2 things. A submission of personal data before one can have access to post anything related and real time moderation of the comments. Big platforms like YouTube, Instagram and others are held accountable for their users' actions and they have had a lot of success so far. Source: https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/combat-online-hate-speech/
__label__Support	I agree. Accountability is extremly important for public confidence, so very important that this happens
__label__Attack	I think using personal data would be tricky. Many companies have been caught selling user's data without consent or storing it in an unsafe way, which could harm those affected by hate speech more than those who post it
__label__Position	Registering with ID is the single step that would improve incidences of hate speech in comments section. That coupled with live moderation either by AI or human, and following rules that can quickly adapt to change should greatly rduce hate speech.
__label__Support	Absolutely! With the current developments in technology we have enough tools to reduce hate speech without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	Where is the evidence for this? There is no guarantee that people will give correct credentials. Also, who defines 'hate speech'? This is not as simple as you may believe.
__label__Attack	Hate speech is already defined in law in many countries. As its already a criminal offence , the existing legislation provides the definition of hate speech, and blueprint to follow.
__label__Support	I do agree that online hate speech may require different legislation than already exists
__label__Position	I believe that we could also find a legal solution for reducing hate speech. I believe we need a new legislation particularly for hate speech in the Internet. When people knew that hate speech could be criminal offence, most of them would not post it.
__label__Support	I totally agree with this idea, this would still allow for comments on newspaper websites while at the same time addressing the issue of online hate speech.
__label__Support	I think the practicalities of providing identity verification could be tricky. For instance, you could have people attempting to pose as others and posting inflammatory statements.

__label__Support	Very funny.
__label__Support	good way to make a point
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	Less hate speech
__label__Support	One sided opinions
__label__Attack	I think it is important for newspapers to provide a platform for people to express and discuss their opinions. Being able to hear other peoples' opinions is an important part of educating oneself, so completely eliminating a comment section seems unprogressive.
__label__Position	A mass ban on certain words should be the first step and the be moderated by the users through a report system. This will eliminate the need for a dedicated moderator and instead be self governed. The final action can be decided by the newspaper which, for the most part should be a quick procedure.
__label__Position	I do not think comment sections should be completely eliminated, however they should be regularly monitored and certain words could be blocked from the comments to reduce hate speech.
__label__Attack	need to have a full time moderator
__label__Support	no one will be mortally offended if everything is made bland by the removal of all contentious discussion
__label__Position	By developing a system that will automatically eliminate any hate speech comments before some sort of publication.
__label__Position	The comment section needs to be moderated using some kind of filter to automatically filter any words on the banned list and then use a report system to flag up anything which tries to bypass this. This will allow a human moderator to quickly decide what can be kept and what needs action.
__label__Position	Comment sections are useful and needed, but there should be some monitoring and regulations in place to ensure that hateful comments are reduced. A reporting system and a list of banned words would help, as would a system where moderators could approve or deny posts containing images. Reported comments, once reviewed, could be completely deleted or quarantined depending on the severity of the post in question. In some case, quarantining posts to be hidden unless unhidden by individual users could allow the flow of posts to be followed and understood within the context of a conversation. This is a similar system to what is already in place in social media platforms such as Facebook and Reddit.
__label__Position	Yes, hate speech has become a pandemic and people are not aware of the damage it causes, removing or blocking such comments is not a solution and the perpetrator will use another platform. Rather let's educate one another and develop informative educational policy to eliminate the source rather than the symptoms. Education will liberate the mind and promote uniy and selfless.
__label__Attack	you admitted that this 'ain't true'. Although hate comments may not initially cause any physical harm, the psychological damage caused by hate comments is bad enough and can eventually lead to physical damage too.
__label__Attack	Some dissenting opinions and hate comments can spur conversation and be used as a learning opportunity, but it is important for people who use hate speech to be removed from the platform if it becomes too much. The people using the hate speech will become more emboldened and continue to use hate speech if it is allowed to continue.
__label__Position	It is unnecessary to have censorship of comment sections. Let everyone see the bigots, the haters and yes, people with a different view of the world. It wont hurt to see that some people live totally different lives. That IS what reading is all about you know, living lives other than our own.
__label__Attack	this outs a limit on free speech
__label__Support	makes the comments more welcoming to everyone
__label__Position	Focus on neural subjects, but in reality hate speech is just a part of life
__label__Support	lowers the risk of hate speech being needed
__label__Position	We cannot! As simply as that
__label__Attack	By removing the comment section will entice further hate speech on another platform. Rather allow people to give their opinion and block comments that relate to hate speech.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	As much people have freedom of speech we are also obliged to respect other people whilst doing so.
__label__Attack	one persons free speech is another persons hate speech
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Support	Completely agree with this point. Address the root cause of the problem might be difficult but hate speech should be avoided at all costs.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	People wont be able to express themselves
__label__Support	It will avoid people upsetting others.
__label__Position	Moderators should review comment submissions and remove those that are inflammatory or hateful.
__label__Support	This will enable people to discuss freely
__label__Attack	The moderator needs to not be too strict
__label__Attack	There comments may be offensive to others.
__label__Support	It gives them freedom of speech and a chance to express themselves.
__label__Position	There should be no option to log in without providing some form of ID so people posting harmful hate speech can be tracked and prosecuted.
__label__Position	Put in word blocks
__label__Position	I believe people should be able to comment but the comments should be monitored
__label__Position	Put in word blocks and monitor the use of the comment section a lot more.
__label__Position	All users that sign up to have access to a websites comments section should agree to a declaration before having this option made available to them. If they then go on to violate the declaration and post hate speech their speech will be made unavailable for others to view on the site but will be used against them when they are prosecuted by the newspaper.
__label__Position	a system where people have to submit personal information before they can post a comment is a good idea. This could be reduce hate speech.
__label__Support	Completely agree with this! Both by human moderator and maybe AI to help identifying and flagging posts that could contain hate speech based on keywords.
__label__Position	I think giving particulars when you comment will help with accountability
__label__Position	Requiring users to login and provide personal data (as you would with any website you sign up to) in order to comment. Then have the website monitior IP addresses to see if multiple accounts are being used for hate speech.
__label__Attack	This would be really hard to put into practice. I believe people should have the freedom to remain anonymous as long as they are respecful of others.
__label__Position	Is it necessary to have readers comments? What do they add to the article?
__label__Attack	so
__label__Position	Freedom of speech will not be resiticted if we monitor hate speech. there has to be a line drawn, and this is the line.
__label__Position	I believe that this whole debate has been had. What needs to be implemented not just in regards to election matters or health related matters is a fact checker system available on all sites like one that was available on twitter. See here for more details https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/03/03/twitter-birdwatch-fact-check-misinfo-test/
__label__Position	I think comments give the ability to the users to express their opinion on what is described in the articles and this is an important rule for democracy. Removing the ability to comment in my view is basically limiting free speech. I also believe that user do not need necessarily to be identifiable, being anonymous is fine as long as they respect others and their opinions.
__label__Attack	giving those you always provide hate speech anonymously gives them the upper hand with gettong away with it. It makes it easier for them to do it over and over again
__label__Position	Closing comments is not a solution in my opinion. I think the comments are quite interesting and I'm sure there are many people who like to read comments like me. The best solution is to have people's names and surnames appear and have a control mechanism for comments.
__label__Position	Newspapers should be neutral when reporting, however, nowadays that isnt the case and I feel they are the ones that actually instigate hate speech - negativity sells and if they can get as much reaction they will go to any lenghts to do so. In order to fairly reduce the hate speech from readers comments it has to be heavily moderated, personal details required in order to make a comment and possibly have a word block or something where the comment is replaced with "this goes against our hate speech p olicy"

__label__Position	As evidenced by this story the dangers in letting people comment without clear consequences is dire so I see the need for such debate https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/fake-dr-oz-poster-went-viral-twitter-fact-check-not-rcna46899
__label__Position	I believe removing the comment section is not a solution and that it actually encourages hate speech
__label__Support	I completely agree with this and this might also allow journalist to engage with their readers. I found this study to be really interesting about how the majority of journalists that were interviewed found values in comments.
__label__Support	I leave a link to the study: https://mediaengagement.org/research/journalists-and-online-comments/
__label__Support	https://mediaengagement.org/research/journalists-and-online-comments/
__label__Support	I leave below a link to the study I mentioned above but was not able to attach and I am curious to hear what is others opinion. https://mediaengagement.org/research/journalists-and-online-comments/
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Attack	I think hate speech should be reduced as much as possible if not removed completely. This is very different from being able to provide constructive criticism which should always be allowed but there are boundaries.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Attack	I think that people need to be able to post comments but not offend others so I think that it should be policed by the webiste or they need to consider AI to filter out bad comments
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Attack	Having comments has shown that readers engage more in the argument https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Support	collapsing the comment section is not the solution because people have freedom of speech however those who make hateful comments can be flagged or banned from using the site
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Support	The United Nations have outlined what hate soeech is here, so this could be used overall as a rule of thumb... https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed

__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	Ideally comment section should not be available on newspaper to reduce hate speech
__label__Attack	hate speech can be controlled by way of manual review or even bots programmed to look out for flagged words
__label__Position	There should be hate speech words that should be used to warn the user and not allow them to post by disabling the post button if there are hate speech words.
__label__Support	I agree that key words could be added to some come of algorhythm to stop people using them.
__label__Position	Comments should be vetted by publishers before posting on newspapers.to avoid hate speeches
__label__Position	the comment section should not be disabled as is it there for the readers to engage with the content uploaded so it makes no sense to close it, however there should be restrictions.
__label__Position	It needs to be monitored, perhaps by an algorythm.
__label__Position	the comment section should remain as it allows the readers to engage with the article. to reduce the risk of hate speech there should be restrictions and should be moderated to ensure the risk of hate speech is minimum
__label__Position	There will always be a few bad apples in a batch just as there will always be bad people among humanity. Honestly the easiest method of combatting this issue is through the utilization of manual review teams perhaps hired by the newspaper or even paid through revenue made by the articles failing that approach bots can be instantiated with the programmed capability of removing comments that have flagged contents inside them.
__label__Support	Yes I agree, I feel that we are probably fairly used to sifting through the rubbish on the internet, and at times the trolls can be entertaining, as long as it isn't nasty.
__label__Position	Nice. Your comment sums it up. Comments should be allowed to enable freedom of speech but vetted to prevent hate speeches that can invite violence amomgs the citizens
__label__Attack	also would allow anyone to say whatever hate they havem to say
__label__Support	Will allow anyone to have a comment where necessary
__label__Position	I'm finding replying to comments here really awkward. As soon as I start typing the page moves, grrrr! However, I don't agree with vetting comments. I do agree with free speech, but not hate speech. People are entitled to an opinion without having to be nasty or a keyboard warrior. Moderating could be used to take out hateful comments, without taking away a well rounded debate, but where those lines are drawn is anyones guess!
__label__Support	better stance than removing the comments altogether
__label__Position	Comments need to be checked before being sent to the public because some of these comments can destroy some public figures
__label__Position	Hate speech on newspaper websites can be reduced by checking for swear words or any vulgar language that maybe present in the comment but it should not be disabled because people have freedom of speech and cancelling the comment section will not only affect those who make bad comments but also those who give insights and engage positively with the content
__label__Position	reducing hate speech on the newspaper websites is possible without taking the drastic measures of completely cancelling the comment section one way of doing that there should be moderators who approve the comment before they are published on the website.
__label__Position	By encouraging witneses and victims of hate speech to report hate speech on the internet
__label__Position	reducing hate speech on the newspaper websites is possible without taking the drastic measures of completely cancelling the comment section one way of doing that there should be moderators who approve the comment before they are published on the website.
__label__Position	Using an algorithm is the best solution.
__label__Position	I'm having trouble reading the comments on here. The page keeps moving. I can only confirm what I have already written that comments should be allowed but would have to be moderated in some way. I don't know how this would happen, since there could be too many comments for a human to police. Perhaps a combination of a bot checking comments and a real human might work. I don't think you will completely eliminate hate speech because everyone has different life experiences. It should be up to the individual to realise what makes sense instead of enforcing a kind of nanny state. People should be able to make up their own minds. The issue happens when you become the target and how it can affect you personally. However, I still believe that we need freedom of speech and the only way to stop it is to police the comments and discourage by criminalising it to empower victims.

__label__Position	In the words of Peter Parker :"With great power, comes great responsibility." That said, it is absolutely the responsibility of a newspaer outlet to ensure that what they put on their platform is not harmful to those who come across it
__label__Position	I think that newspaper websites should not disable the comment section they should monitor it and remove anyone spreading hate or conspiracy theories regardless of this whole freedom of speech thing newspapers should have the power to ban anyone spreading bogus news,

__label__Position	newspaper websites should regulate social media, and hate speech should be tackled by establishing monitoring and evaluation in newsrooms.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.

__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	I believe there are no pros to allowing hate speech
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Hateful comments should allow respondents to persuade otherwise. Comments can be a good force for change and shouldn't be cancelled.
__label__Support	The only time I think it is good to eliminate comments, is if the target is harmed psychologically by it. But I do think it could be policed in some way to offset this.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.

__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Position	In summary, I believe that comments should be encouraged, and healthy discussion allowed on these sites. Comment spaces should not be removed but they should be regulated and monitored for such speech. Education should be given to users making hate speech, if this is not successful then punishments should extend froma temporary ban to a permanent one.
__label__Position	https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech
__label__Position	We need the discussion facility - but with good moderation
__label__Position	By having guidelines that must be adhered to with regard to the truth of stataements so that they are factual and not "alternative facts" and by banning anything that could be construed as hate speech,
__label__Position	https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/ The article linked here shows the outcome for many outlets who faced the issue of hate spech in their comment sections. One who disabled the section turned it back on eventually. And a leading newspaper actually invested in the comment sections, and provides the ability for readers & staffers to 'spotlight' top comments. This enhances my position that comment sections should not be removed and instead moderated and positive discussion allowed.
__label__Position	It's good to have healthy debates with people from different backgrounds and can lead to improved understanding and a different perspective.

__label__Attack	getting rid of comment sections reduces the change for openness towards the topic, you cannot educate people you can't reach
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Support	Having moderators filter out bad words or comments that contain hate speech would do so much good. This allows everybody to comment their opinion but remove those that are hateful and disrespectful.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	removing comment sections takes away the chance to interact with others about a topic you care about
__label__Position	I am for people being allowed to post their opinions in a comment section as long as it is moderated correctly & fairly.
__label__Position	In my opinion, we need a large number of moderators in the comment sections who can quickly delete or censor hateful comments. But for all that it is necessary that these sections are not subjected to a too big censorship so that people can continue to express themselves freely
__label__Position	I think that keeping an open space for discussion is vital and needed. Strick and easy to understand rules should be there and a group of moderators implementing them as well. We should do more about educating on media ethics, keeping freedom of expression should be combined with counteracting hate speech messages.
__label__Position	I agree with the point of view that there should be a broad spectrum of moderators to stop any particular biased opinion or agenda from controlling the comments.
__label__Support	I think this is a great idea and would certainly help the situation if sone correctly.
__label__Position	I do agree that Hate Speeh can be an issue. Removing the ability to make comments for readers would stop. Maybe some form of vetting comments prior to publishing would help the situation.
__label__Position	Maybe the only solution is to remove the space for comments? We see the same issues on other platforms that allow comments!
__label__Support	An easy and inexpensive way to stop hateful comments
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Support	i agree, it is a form of violence
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Attack	i agree there has to be a balance, and freedom of speech is important for society.. but there has to be limits as to hate speech, and discrimination.
__label__Attack	These comments are on their sites and it is their responsibility to control them. Some comments may be discriminating and therefore do not belong on the site
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Support	agree, the news could start selling fake information if the comment section would be removed
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	Very appropriate. Hopefully people will interpret this that if they were thinking of posting something bad then keep quiet and don't!
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	How are moderators fairly decided upon? Would newspapers choose moderators who would enforce their political ideology? I think this is a quick road to platform-controlled censorship.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	There should be ways to monitor the type of language used, perhaps through AI. It should be able to pick up key words related to hate speech.
__label__Position	I agree that the only way to ensure balanced discussion without allowing hate or eliminating genuine responses is through moderation of comments before posting
__label__Support	I agree that having at least one moderator present would reduce/eliminate hate speech. It could be done after comments are automatically submitted (delete the hateful comments after public viewing within a certain time frame) or, even better, they can only be posted after careful consideration by the moderator(s), permitting only positive comments.
__label__Position	there must be a way to build in logarithms to find certain words or phrases
__label__Support	That's a very good point and thanks for pointing out what it's called. I learned something new today! I have seen countless times in anti (fill in blank) groups that use asterisks and other characters to write out otherwise blocked words. They get around the system.
__label__Position	i maintain my position in saying that algorithms can be used to identify hate speech. It's important to adhere to the rights of the readers and give them a way to express their opinions,otherwise how else could the newspaper get feedback?
__label__Position	people have varying opinions about issues, and some do not consider their opinions as hate speech even if they are. reducing hate speech therefore will require websites to have a moderator who reads over comments and maybe a disclaimer for readers on what the newspaper considers hate speech.
__label__Position	you cant, by reducing hate speech you are eliminating free speech
__label__Support	I agree with this. It's important for the newspaper to know how readers feel and react to the content
__label__Position	You need stricter standards with moderators who act quickly to censor and analyse comments to remove those which cross boundaries.
__label__Position	People have different opinions on different news topics and may not see their hate comment to be something bad while others may. A comment section is made available for everyone to share their opinions. Although sometimes the hate comments are taken out of hand so aa AI moderator should be made available to filter out the hate comments that get out of hand.
__label__Position	I think it's important to remember that free speech doesn't remove consequences of that speech but people who may have views which the majority of people don't support are rarely coming at it with an intention of 'hate' and having the difficult discussions might be the only way they will be exposed to the information which might change their thinking
__label__Position	This comment was removed because it broke the hate speech policy of this webstie.
__label__Position	The purpose of a comment section is for everyone to express their opinions on a certain topic and can provide feedback. Completely removing the comment section may be disadvantageous in some cases so instead of completely removing it perhaps it can be moderated on a regular basis and remove inappropriate comments.
__label__Position	newspapers should not have a comments section.
__label__Attack	You didn't discuss why they should not include a comments section. A comment sections allows the public to share their opinions on the subject matter and engage with one another pros and cons of the issue and see other points of view.
__label__Position	Instead of completely removing the comment section, it should be censored and regularly monitored.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	surely this should be the job of the editor to make sure the journalists are impartial
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Support	I agree. As per 'The Free Speech Balancing Act of Digital Intermediaries: An explication of the concept of content governance' (Johnson, Brett (2015)' online news outlets face several competing duties: to promote free speech, to prevent harm, to obey the law, and to make money. Their entire business model relies on discourse and to prevent that is to deny readers/users the very service they claim to be providing. Some kind of voting system would allow harmful comments to be surpressed by the users themselves. It should really be left to the platforms themselves to figure out a way to manage potential hate speech (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00550-7#Sec4) through their own platforms as they have a responsibility to both limit harmful speech but keep discussion free and open.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Support	I agree with this
__label__Support	i agree
__label__Attack	people naturally get angry so its difficult to reduce hate speech without any group being offended to some distinction
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Support	I agree with this point of view - a lot of the times I hear people railing against the censorship of hatespeech it is because they aren't aware of the damage they are causing or have been caught out saying something they didn't think was bad to begin with
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed

__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	Just allow people to report bad comments and when it gets to a certain number it should delete the message and send an automatic email to the person who wrote it with a warning.
__label__Attack	What about people who have a view that is considered unpopular or opposing? Say it's election time - what would happen if one team uses tech-warriors to delete pro- opposition comments just because they go against their agenda?
__label__Position	People should be members with addresses checked
__label__Support	people should be accountable for making bad decisions
__label__Position	We need a more thick skin with some of our debate topics if we want to win arguements against "hate"
__label__Support	Being open to the voice of the opposition means that we can hear another side of the argument
__label__Support	some checks but again what filter are we going to use to ensure we have limits as people will censor easily too
__label__Position	Is it really hate speech or is it just an opinion that we don't want to hear?
__label__Attack	there is a difference between hate speech and an opposite view
__label__Position	Hate speech should not be tolerated but its curtailing should not be prioritised over freedom to comment. Ultimately, private companies (online newspapers) are free to restrict comment sections in any way they see fit but ideally we should be allowing free discussion with a robust moderation system in place.
__label__Support	i agree with this
__label__Position	Highlight the bad speech so we openly discuss it more
__label__Position	through policy change and legal definitions of hate speech. Online newspapers should not be a space for personal vendettas or cancel culture to decide what people can say but instead a space where the law is upheld .
__label__Position	hate speech must be clearly defined, it should not be left to the media to decide what is and is not considered hate speech
__label__Position	A lot of the times I hear people railing against the censorship of hatespeech it is because they aren't aware of the damage they are causing or have been caught out saying something they didn't think was bad to begin with. I think that anything that is removed should be explained to the poster as well as the impact that t could have on other people
__label__Support	good explaination of the reason it removed should be more than enough for people to understand
__label__Attack	If people aren’t made aware of issues relating to hate speech, there may not be enough awareness to create a change
__label__Position	add a set of blacklisted words that people can not post and will be automatically removed and also have moderaters that read all posted comments are are able to remove and comment that may contain hate speech
__label__Position	Certain hateful words/phrases could be blocked or they could introduce a reporting option in the comments section.
__label__Support	would be a very good start to flagging hateful people
__label__Support	This is true which is why I also suggested introducing a reporting feature so that, in cases where hate speech may not automatically be detected, people would still be able to raise a concern about the comment.
__label__Position	https://eachother.org.uk/would-removing-social-media-anonymity-protect-or-threaten-our-rights/ Perhaps hate comments could be reduced by removing the ability to post comments anonymously?
__label__Attack	Agreed people may be highly less likely to post negative comments if they had their true identity in display!
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted.

__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	Agreed. And many of these potential solutions are also not successful at limiting harmful content (https://slate.com/technology/2018/05/the-facebook-upvote-and-downvote-experiment-is-a-bust.html). As long as the platform is comforming to the laws of the country then it should not have to introduce further measures to limit hate speech at the expense of preventing free and open discussion.

__label__Attack	offending is not necessary
__label__Support	free speech should be controlled but allowed
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Attack	100% agree, Comment section is for everyone to present their opinion at all times
__label__Attack	Agree. it also highlights the need for work to be done on hate speech/racism. Just because the comments section isn't there, doesn't mean hate speech doesn't exist.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Attack	This reduces free speech and lets the negative win
__label__Attack	Newspapers are a valid and beneficial space for comments
__label__Support	No comments means less moderator headaches and potential to offend
__label__Support	Absolutely agree with this. Newspapers will moderate comments that do not agree with their agenda.
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy

__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Reduces free speech
__label__Support	It removes the problem of potential hate speech
__label__Position	Every person should be traceable, so they are accountable. If your comments consist of hate speech or are offensive then you be accounable.
__label__Attack	I think this is an invasion of privacy and the internet allows people to be the person they want to be and want to identify as - something they might not feel comfortable doing in real life.
__label__Attack	I think this is an invasion of privacy and the internet allows people to be the person they want to be and want to identify as - something they might not feel comfortable doing in real life.
__label__Position	Free speech is an important component of society and comments on newspaper articles can often enhance the article itself by providing additional evidence and balance. However, the anonymity of the internet allows for extreme views to be aired that go beyond what a newspaper website is comfortable publishing. To address this, both automated bad language detectors and a set of both editorial and user moderators should be present. A final point is to allow post-moderation, e.g. users can report offensive topics to the moderators.
__label__Position	I think you can put a price to the website- a subscription to readers.
__label__Support	Less consumers/readers/
__label__Support	Young people can be eliminated, who are likely to hate speech because of lack of information.
__label__Position	I think websites can also try to filter out words that represent hate speech, so that when a person types the word out, it automatically declines to send their comment.
__label__Position	There is no one answer. it must be a multitude of approaches. It is every organisations responsibility to regulate its platforms.
__label__Attack	The reason why I disagree is because removing the comment sections unable readers from expressing their view and opinions on certain topics covered in the newspaper.
__label__Position	I think that the website should develop a hate speech filtering software, to remove all offensive words that might be of hate speech.
__label__Attack	Its unlikely there will be such software that recognises all slang / racist words
__label__Position	monitoring each and every users s comments and warn the users that posts hate speech, and if they continue to posts comments of hate speech after several warnings then take down their accounts or ban them from the website.
__label__Support	Agree. Certain words can be filtered and if triggered comment can be removed
__label__Attack	People will tick that they agree, but write what they want anyway! And if they're anonymous there are no repercussions for them.
__label__Support	I don't think there are any
__label__Position	And any response that limits speech needs to be very carefully weighed to ensure that this remains wholly exceptional, and that legitimate robust debate is not curtailed. refer to this website for more information https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000233231
__label__Position	I think it's a bit of a lost cause. People will put hate speech in. The only way to stop it, I think is to not allow comments to be made. Technically, that's what happens with print versions of newspapers. We just read the article. Anyone who wants to express an opinion can write a letter to the editor. (Who would screen out hate stuff!). But, we live in an online world. So people expect to be able to have their say. And people probably wouldn't subscribe if they can't interact on an online service. Anyway, I do think people having verified accounts might help. Need to stop the "anonymous" profiles - the coward's castle types.
__label__Support	I agree with the anonymous profile comment
__label__Position	I do think that comments sections online can be a bit of a breeding ground for hate speech and racist, sexist and xenophobic comments. If one person comments something that falls into one of these categories, and encourages others. I think this is wider problem for society though, and living in a country that has freedom of speech I don't think we should censor what people think or what to say. I think more needs to be done to educate, rather than ban. Its a very tough question of how as a society we tackle this. I don't think the governments actions (such as brexit) have helped matters as there seems to be more of divide now than before.
__label__Position	I'd happily see all comments sections removed for the good of the public in general. Nobody needs to know that Tony from Bognor thinks All Them Lot Should Go Home, because Tony is a twat who shouldn't be given a platform.
__label__Position	Maybe if the comments were better moderated then this would reduce the amount of hate speech.
__label__Attack	I think this intrudes on free speech and is a danger to moderating certain things the newspaper might not want to be affiliated with.
__label__Position	In the digital world we live in - unfortunately hate speech is part and parcel of the benefits of having such an open forum and allowing everyone to have a voice. Hate speech is made by a minuscule minority of people. Perhaps have a 'report hate speech' button that members of the community can use.
__label__Attack	Nobody should have to see it regardless.
__label__Attack	We shouldn't have to see it regardless.
__label__Attack	The downside to this is who is going to moderate it - where is the baseline of what is acceptable and what is not. It's a real challenge.
__label__Attack	The downside to this is who will moderate and what will be their baseline. It's a real challenge.
__label__Position	Perhaps a team of moderators could be required, either with the power to approve posts that are waiting for approval, or by reactively monitoring.
__label__Attack	This still poses an issue with what people think is acceptable. You run the risk of people joining in as opposed to call it out.
__label__Position	Perhaps moderators could be required to act proactively (approving posts before they're public) rather than reactively (deleting etc).
__label__Support	Completely agree - there's a lot of evidence out there to support this https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech
__label__Position	Unfortunately, the public's view on acts of terrorism (including domestic) can be strongly swayed by the effective use of such innocent feeling things as comment sections, as these groups may flood such sections underneath reporting of their own acts with sympathetic or 'this isn't an issue' type posts, thus influencing others' opinions directly or indirectly.
__label__Support	Supporting evidence, since the 'fetch args' button is refusing to attach it: https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=Social%20Networks%20as%20the%20New%20Frontier%20of%20Terrorism
__label__Position	Newspapers -should- be taking responsibility for making sure users don't violate hate speech regulations and similar in their comments sections, but simply don't seem to be held accountable when they don't. https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=The%20New%20Governors:%20The%20People,%20Rules%20and%20Processes%20Governing%20Online%20Speech

__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Support	Agree with some of this. Hate speech is just a fake concept to avoid certain discussions
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Support	removing the comment space completely would allow people to focus solely on the content of the news and not allow people to provide their comments, this might give people the chance to be completely objective and just focus on what is in front of them instead of them using the comment space as a place to vent their frustrations.
__label__Attack	Hate speech is a nonsense concept.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Attack	I want to hear everyones opinion
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	i don't think submitting personal data is a good idea to reduce hate speech, it is invasive
__label__Attack	Straight out of the WEF. No thanks.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	I agree with you on this, it's helping someone with a job, and it protects the person in the article from hate speech.
__label__Position	eliminating the comment space on the internet would not only reduce hate speech, it would also remove the positive comments so i don't think this is a good idea at all. Regulation would encourage discussion whilst allowing people to express strong opinions without resorting to hate speech.
__label__Position	how about only allowing certain words/sentences to be used within the comment box, or even just emojis?
__label__Position	I think news outlets should not encourage hate comments, which some do (e.g. MailOnline) by their headlines and stories they choose to run and how they write them. I also think there should be a screening process for anyone who wants to post a comment.
__label__Position	Use automated algorythums
__label__Support	I agree with both of these ideas. Having a moderation means consistency, but having other readers flag comments allows other commenters to hold peers to account and ensure that the comment section is an inclusive and fair section.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	I disagree with this. I think taking away discussion completely also takes away healthy debate and positive conversation. There are ways to reduce hate comments, such as the ones outlined in this Forbes article: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnrampton/2015/04/09/10-tips-to-dealing-with-trolls/?sh=58ddf0f754f4.
__label__Attack	I think the main things to ensure are: - Taking away the option for anonymous accounts - Having a screening process - Giving users the ability to flag comments they think are innapropriate
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	I find your view hateful.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Support	Everyone has a right to say but it should be put across correctly
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Position	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	This view takes away users ability to interact. This also allows for bias online.
__label__Position	i think the same that people can comment as long as it is being watched
__label__Position	we could have people checking comments regularly and there be a helpline for people to inform of hate speech
__label__Position	In a survey of news sites it was found that on average 11% of comments are removed...some of these are because they are spam and some because they are offensive. I think that the fact that it's more than one in two really shows how necessary moderation is, these issues are so common.

__label__Attack	(sorry I mean one in ten)
__label__Position	by using a moderator to flag hate speech in the comments
__label__Position	I don't think this is possible. We should go back to physical printed newspapers.
__label__Attack	This is bad for the environment and also limits some people from reading news, even if free.
__label__Position	while newspapers can (and should) moderate their comments, more hate speech is spread more quickly on social media such as facebook
__label__Attack	when hate speech encourages violence or discrimination against any specific class of people it should be removed regardless of how inoffensive an particular individual might find it
__label__Position	Freedom of speech is not the problem here. We need to educate people to make the right choices.
__label__Position	We cannot! As simply as that
__label__Support	i think these ideas would be the way forward and i agree
__label__Support	i think this is correct but i do feel that there is more that technology can do to help these days too
__label__Support	https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/03/technology-and-regulation-must-work-in-concert-to-combat-hate-speech-online/
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	Freedom of speech is important but it's important we use it in the correct way. If what we are saying results in bullying then that should be shutdown.
__label__Attack	Does not allow for positive feedback
__label__Support	Stops online bullying
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
