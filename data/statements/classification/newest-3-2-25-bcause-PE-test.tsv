__label__Position	"John Henley, a clergyman,[14] founded an Oratory in 1726 with the principal aim of ""reforming the manner in which public presentations should be performed"".[15]: 63  He extensively utilized the print industry to advertise the events of his Oratory, establishing it as a ubiquitous part of the London public sphere. Henley also played a crucial role in shaping the space of the debating club; he introduced two platforms to his room in the Newport district of London for the staging of debates and organized the entrances to facilitate the collection of admission fees. These modifications were further carried out when Henley relocated his enterprise to Lincoln's Inn Fields. With the public now willing to pay for entertainment, Henley capitalized on the growing commercialization of British society.[15]: 65–66  By the 1770s, debating societies had become a firmly established part of London society.[16]"
