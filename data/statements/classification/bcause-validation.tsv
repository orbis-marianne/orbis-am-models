__label__Position	It may be technically possible to reverse climate change but is getting harder year by year
__label__Support	Every year that passes we lose tools or opportiunities that could work to counteract climate change as well as more damage is added - therefore is -unfortunately- irrevrsible
__label__Support	It may be difficult, but the long run cost of doing nothing will certainly outweigh the costs of doing something. The sooner we act the better our chances of making a real difference.
__label__Support	I agree that it can be very challenging. But what good is it to just give up. We have to at least try to make change, no matter how hard it can be. We just have to learn how to make the right types of changes.
__label__Attack	I agree that the sooner we act the better. Every day climate change grows.
__label__Attack	I agree. What does it help to not even try to change the advancement of climate change?
__label__Attack	We're already experiencing an economic crisis. We can't just keep investing in preventing climate change. We have other priorities.
__label__Attack	I believe that too much damage has already been done by governments around the world especially due to geoengineering tactics that have already caused harm that cannot be reversed.
__label__Support	This is very true, but then isn't it time to start before it gets to be a worse situation? The economic impacts are starting to hit now.
__label__Support	What is more important than preventing climate change? Economic crisis? Your world is dying, we are dooming future generations with our actions and you have other priorities?
__label__Support	You are right. The problem is slowly growing which is why we need to take steps to address it now.
__label__Support	it's a survey question
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	Climate change is accelerating - due to feedback loops- much faster that what humanity can -or is willing to- decelerate it. Unfortunately is not feasible with current technology
__label__Attack	If we identify the negative feedback loops and break them, then we have a chance of slowing or even reversing climate change
__label__Support	Policy makers have vested interests with industry to ignore signals of overshoot and straining risks. Whatever action will be taken too late and there is no way to prevent feedback loops
__label__Attack	I agree is a matter of political will above everything else
__label__Support	Technology can not correct this problem unless u can grow more trees as quick as possible using technology.
__label__Support	Technology can help but isn't the ultimate solution. We need to reduce overall consumption.
__label__Attack	Technology can help in sharing the importance to many people in less time
__label__Support	Technology is ever changing. Maybe what we currently have cannot make lasting change, but it can make a change in the right direction. As technology updates, we can do more. I think it's more of an issue of becoming willing.
__label__Support	YES
__label__Support	True, we need to increase technology to deal with this problem.
__label__Attack	I'm not sure the answers to those questions but if more of us put pressure on policy makers to invest funds into scientific studies it would give us a greater idea, but no one seems to care or want to spend any money to improve understanding of the issue.
__label__Support	It is happening due to some natural causes too. Technology can't stop the natural course of things.
__label__Support	I agree that if governments are not willing to inform the public and stop manipulating us by placing chemical in the air for solar engineering than how do they expect individuals to comply
__label__Attack	I agree. too much damage has already been done to reverse the process and many people are unwilling to make changes to their lives that may be too much for their budget to handle
__label__Attack	Technology changes every day. Things are possible today that were unheard of just a few years ago. Who knows what could be possible in a few years, given enough inventiveness and creativity. It's not about "current" technology; it's about future technology -- the very near future.
__label__Position	Human resources and efforts are best used adapting to the effects of climate change, rather than attempting to mitigate climate change itself.
__label__Support	I agree I think we should adapt the best we can. We can't change what has already happened.
__label__Support	I think we can fight climate change I don't think it is too late yet.
__label__Attack	Humans have very little effect on what can be done to eradicate such a large problem. Yes every little bit helps, but how can the poor people afford to pay the extra for environmentally safe products, etc such as electric cars.
__label__Support	Human efforts include planting trees and reduction of pollutants in the environment.
__label__Support	that's because most think there is no use, that it is hopeless
__label__Support	Adaptation is not giving up and I agree that effort made to do this is a good idea. The more people think about this, the more likely they are to achieve changes without even realizing they are doing it. Adaptation doesn't mean we are giving up on the environment. It means we are not stressing so hard over the guilt of what we perceive we have done to damage the earth.
__label__Attack	I dont mind this but we cant ignore the fact that there are company who are spreading so much pollution and greenhouse effect just for profit. We need to reprimand them as well.
__label__Support	Efforts needs to be taken care
__label__Support	Imagine the benefit to humanity all this new science could achieve!
__label__Attack	I don't think these are all realistic goals.
__label__Attack	That's a huge investment when we do have other issues in the world to deal with first.
__label__Attack	We don't have the resources to do this. It is completely unreasonable.
__label__Support	The thing here is, if we don't do it, then there's nothing we have to look forward to. Anything else will be null and void without a planet to live on.
__label__Support	These investments don't all have to be a negative thing - they can lead to massive job growth and prosperity, if designed and implemented correctly.
__label__Support	i agree. it is going to take some major technology advances to tackle the problem.
__label__Position	The nature itself correct the human inflicted changes and balance the climate. But the human should bear the losses in this process
__label__Attack	absolutely true growing more trees are the only solution to this problem
__label__Attack	I agree. We already have lumber shortages as it is and this will only get worse as time goes on unless we do something. Deforestation has caused a lot of issues and reversing that could go a long way in helping to stabilize the climate once again.
__label__Attack	Technology can help. Planting trees can also help but isn't the single solution. We need to simultaneously adopt many strategies and methods to fight climate change.
__label__Position	I think we have to look into alternatives fuels and see how we can cut down on the consumption. The main onus is on big organisations since they are major defaulters.
__label__Support	Companies strategically and purposely try to shift the blame and responsibility onto individual consumers. We need regulations and government intervention to force change on a larger scale, or companies will continue to irreparably damage the environment for short term profits.
__label__Position	We cannot adopt but we should adopt to it because there is no other go with the affected environment unless helping the environment less pollution
__label__Position	electric vehicles should be consider as mandatory by the major fuel consumption nations
__label__Attack	While I agree, there are a lot of things that have to happen first before this can become a reality. We have to rework gas stations around the country so that they have the charging stations necessary for electric vehicles and we have to build the charging stations near highways and thoroughfares for those same electric cars so that the future infrastructure is ready to handle the influx of electric cars before demanding they be manufactured at such a high rate.
__label__Position	I am sorry but NO. Almost the whole human civilisation runs of fossil fuels pumped from the deep carbon cycle to the fast carbon cycle. It will reverse naturally over several million years, not the short-term which we can benefit from right now.
__label__Position	Conservation of resources may end up where it's eventually undone by someone who takes them, as nature doesnt like a void.So climate change can be neutral at best and getting worse at worst with this principle.
__label__Position	Some damage towards the climate is currently irreversible to prevent reversal in time.
__label__Support	By our actions many species have been made extinct and the chemistry of the gasses that make up our atmosphere have been altered.Climate change caused extinctions are permanent, it follows therefore we cannot wind back the clock.
__label__Attack	The fact is that the knowledge on climate change is still very limited. Assumptions that we make about the damage today could be disproved tomorrow. Take for example the holes in the Ozone. We discovered them with advances in technology, but no one is really sure that we caused them or even for how long they had actually been there. With advancements in technology there is little reason to believe we can't reverse some of these things.
__label__Attack	This may be true to an extent, but it isn't a reason to give up on making positive change to create a better future.
__label__Position	I do believe that climate change is an issue but we need to put the blame to big organisations and put the onus on them to reverse it.
__label__Attack	Climate Change is the main issue It causes a lot damage to our environment Thanks to some of the volunteers who are helping to fix the issue by sharing the issues in mass media to cover up a lot of people
__label__Position	Maybe. But all humanity should collectively act together with the lead of the big super powers. If USA and China stay out, I am afraid it would be useless
__label__Support	Agree, the biggest contributors of CO2 emissions (USA and China) should do the most effort to reverse this
__label__Position	Climate change is anyways is a hoax! 31,000 scientists reject global warming and say "no convincing evidence" that humans can or will cause global warming
__label__Support	Correct , but technology is the need of today's humanity but it should also help the nature side by side
__label__Position	Correct ,technology is the need of today's humanity but it should also help the nature side by side
__label__Position	Statistics and trends are showing that climate change is irreversible(https: //www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99888903&t=1621870823276)
__label__Support	With entropy, all efforts to restore the atmospheric gas balance will still leave a lot of the changes to the worldfor a very long time.Mitigation might be all we can do at this point,rather than being able to fully reverse it.
__label__Attack	Population is the main cause Increase in Population spoils the country Lifestyle also needs to be changed according to the nature
__label__Position	I am sorry but NO. Almost the whole human civilisation runs of fossil fuels pumped from the deep carbon cycle to the fast carbon cycle. It will reverse naturally over several million years, not the short-term which we can benefit from right now.
__label__Position	Human populations are approaching carrying capacity on planet Earth. The scientific community thinks this is a number on the order of 9 to 10 billion people. Without population control, there can be no effective solution for reversing the effects of human-induced climate change.
__label__Support	There is a spread of policies that come under the heading of population control ranging from the coercive to the persuasive.
__label__Position	Some damage towards the climate is currently irreversible to prevent reversal in time.
__label__Support	I like this becuase
__label__Attack	one con is this one
__label__Position	I am sorry but NO. Almost the whole human civilisation runs of fossil fuels pumped from the deep carbon cycle to the fast carbon cycle. It will reverse naturally over several million years, not the short-term which we can benefit from right now.
__label__Position	Some damage towards the climate is currently irreversible to prevent reversal in time.
__label__Attack	Technology may increase to where it can be - like developing time travel.
__label__Position	yes I go with the statement saying If governments around the world treat climate change collectively - the same way they treated World War 2 for instance - then is possible, no matter the cost
__label__Position	Statistics and trends are showing that climate change is irreversible(https: //www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99888903&t=1621870823276)
__label__Position	Human populations are approaching carrying capacity on planet Earth. The scientific community thinks this is a number on the order of 9 to 10 billion people. Without population control, there can be no effective solution for reversing the effects of human-induced climate change.

__label__Support	pro
__label__Attack	cons
__label__Position	Human resources and efforts are best used adapting to the effects of climate change, rather than attempting to mitigate climate change itself.
__label__Position	As by this planet every year human population increased by year by year. so that human needs also may increased. we have to find another solution for this climate change else we have to find alternate reusable energy sources like green gas, electric bike etc. this is the only way to protect our planet from this climate chagne
__label__Position	Some damage towards the climate is currently irreversible to prevent reversal in time.
__label__Support	By our actions many species have been made extinct and the chemistry of the gasses that make up our atmosphere have been altered.Climate change caused extinctions are permanent, it follows therefore we cannot wind back the clock.
__label__Attack	Even though damage is done, there are ways to counter the damage through other actions. If enough of these are done, they can cumulatively overpower the irreversible actions and thus reduce climate change as a net overall.
__label__Attack	Technology may increase to where it can be - like developing time travel.
__label__Support	There are certain steps we can take to help with climate change. Just sitting back sayin that nothing can be done isn't helping anything. We need to step up and take steps toward improving the situation.
__label__Support	I agreee.....
__label__Attack	I disagree......
__label__Support	I disagree but I still overall would do this
__label__Position	I am sorry but NO. Almost the whole human civilisation runs of fossil fuels pumped from the deep carbon cycle to the fast carbon cycle. It will reverse naturally over several million years, not the short-term which we can benefit from right now.
__label__Position	I'm pro taking action. It doesn't have to be a big action, but if we all play our parts, we can make even small changes to help offset the situation.
__label__Position	Sustainable efforts reduce and reverse the global warming trend.
__label__Attack	All we can do is reduce our impact but not reverse it.Unfortunately is statistically inevitable
__label__Position	Climate change is anyways is a hoax! 31,000 scientists reject global warming and say "no convincing evidence" that humans can or will cause global warming
__label__Support	This an argument that I agree with. I do not believe there is a consensus and I have little confidence in the "science" that supports man's heavy influence on climate change. I believe a lot is hysteria used to socially engineer behavior. I also believe a lot of hubris and ego has contributed to this doomsday theory. The leftist talking point last year was we have only 12 years left before we are all dead due to climate change. That is utter nonsense.
__label__Position	Maybe. But all humanity should collectively act together with the lead of the big super powers. If USA and China stay out, I am afraid it would be useless
__label__Position	I think it is possible to reverse climate change, if we do reverse our consumption habits. Though it will take time.
__label__Position	I am sorry but NO. Almost the whole human civilisation runs of fossil fuels pumped from the deep carbon cycle to the fast carbon cycle. It will reverse naturally over several million years, not the short-term which we can benefit from right now.
__label__Support	If carbon dioxide emissions were to decrease, the absorption of carbon dioxide by plant life and through the oceans would remain the same. I think millions of years is a very pessimistic estimate. Our planet tends to balance itself out within a shorter time frame.
__label__Attack	Technology may increase to where it can be - like developing time travel.
__label__Position	I am skeptical of man-made climate change. To answer the prompt I would say yes, it is possible to balance it out. I am not sure what reversing it means. Our planet adapts to climate changes over time. It always has. During the time of the dinosaurs the amount of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the atmosphere was greater than it is today. Earth's climate will always change. Mother nature has the ability to adapt.
__label__Position	The newest "science" related to this topic now questions how additional greenhouses in our atmosphere truly effects atmospheric and climate change. It looks to be that additional carbon dioxide does not have as dramatic an effect on temperature as previously purposed. This is cause to re-question what actually would need to be reversed and how much influence our consumption of fossil fuels actually has on global climate.
__label__Position	Climate change is anyways is a hoax! 31,000 scientists reject global warming and say "no convincing evidence" that humans can or will cause global warming
__label__Position	I agree it is going to need a world effort to control the climate change and also we need to use classic technologies like cycle and public transports . If we don't do it we are suffers lot. surly human cause the global warming the large countries and humans need aware of it. bio gas and low carbon released vehicles most electric and solar vehicles are best.
__label__Position	Human populations are approaching carrying capacity on planet Earth. The scientific community thinks this is a number on the order of 9 to 10 billion people. Without population control, there can be no effective solution for reversing the effects of human-induced climate change.
__label__Position	climate change is very important issue. we are need more awareness about it. we need to reduce, every one is important to take action.we choice alternative to control like bio gas, electric and solar like...
__label__Position	No. sorry i not accept Climate change is not a hoax. we also feel in real life. we need more awarness
__label__Support	Whether or not it is a hoax, human having rational thinking he have the guilty when he affect the environment with pollution like fumes, industrial wastes and other things damaging the society.
__label__Position	If people can start separating strategies to help the earth and politics, I would be more apt to believe it. An example is the new green deal that is being proposed in the US. When you read it, a majority is about socialist policies and overreach of the government and is not relevant in anyway to climate change. Other agreements let large polluters like China and India off the hook while expecting a disproportionate amount from the US. This makes me very cynical about the overall agenda behind it.
__label__Position	Whether or not it is a hoax, human having rational thinking he have the guilty when he affect the environment with pollution like fumes, industrial wastes and other things damaging the society.
__label__Position	Hope the lock down because of corona must have proved that the environment is less polluted when people stop coming out of their home. But it is not possible to stay at home completely. But it is a evidence that human is polluting the economy. so they can reduce the pollution by way of using electric vehicles, cycling and other ways
__label__Position	Government should impose some rules on the people to protect the environment . It may say every one must use electric vehicles, every home must have minimum no of trees grown to counteract the man made damage
__label__Position	I think reversing manmade climate change would be very difficult. Scientists might come up with solutions to attempt it, but I don't think it can be totally reversed.
__label__Support	I agree with you. I don't know that there is a good solution.
__label__Position	I agree that it will get harder every year to address climate change. The worse it gets, the more of a challenge it will be to address it.
__label__Position	I think the best thing for people to right now is to reduce or eliminate their consumption of products that contribute to climate change. That way even if there is not a solution to totally reverse it, at least it will not progress as fast.
__label__Attack	Its not a easy thing to inconvenience people more than they already are.
__label__Position	Think about it life has not been on earth as we know for a very long time, maybe 50- 60 thousand years. The earth has been around for what a trillion years. So what will go first. Lets call it what it is, not attempt to save the earth but to save life on earth. I am pretty sure the earth will be here long after life has been erased from its surface.
__label__Position	Governments do not want to give up control of what makes them rich and fossil fuels make many governments trillions of dollars. If you think they will give up this cash in favor of climate control you are sadly mistaken. As long as money means power we are doomed AND THE POOR WILL BE THE FIRST TO SUFFER.
__label__Position	By letting the earth heal itself and be left alone. The earth has made it this long and I assume and really think it will make it long after we are gone. There are probably some small things we can do here and there, but for the most part the earth can take care of itself.
__label__Position	If you believe that its man made and that man caused it, then its possible and likely that man can fix it like anything else. I guess part of the solution is figuring out a way thats not going to bankrupt us and is reasonable.
__label__Position	We should work to stop polluting the planet just for this sake alone. Who doesn't want a cleaner planet?
__label__Position	To keep the refrigerant management and forest restoration helps to change the climate.It could take a very long period of time but coming decades are survive easily.
__label__Attack	how can we get all countries on board with this?
__label__Attack	Seems to involved and complicated for most to even want to try.
__label__Attack	governments and corporations wont want to spend the money to put in the research for this
__label__Position	We can only achieve by tremendous advances and investment in technology: clean energy production, CO2 capture in massive scale, hydrogen planes, ... , and much much more
__label__Position	In a facilitated discussion, the facilitator assists the parties to prepare for and engage in a conversation around the issues that are causing conflict. A facilitator will assist each party individually to: Identify the issues that are at stake; ... Prepare to have a conversation with the other person about the issues.
__label__Support	As citizens we can put pressure on our elected policy makers to put their time, money, and funding into this cause.
__label__Position	If we identify the negative feedback loops and break them, then we have a chance of slowing or even reversing climate change
__label__Position	To keep the refrigerant management and forest restoration helps to change the climate.It could take a very long period of time but coming decades are survive easily.
__label__Position	Human populations are approching carrying capacity on planet Earth.Without population control there can be no effective solution for reversing the effects of climate cange.
__label__Position	I think we all need to gather our communities and apply pressure on policy makers to address these issues with urgency
__label__Support	Scientists have been saying this many years now, it seems people just want to ignore the problems and hope it will go away on its own!
__label__Attack	There are many scientist who refute the "climate change scenario but are silenced and not allowed to speak their beliefs. They are classified as "conspiracy theorists"
__label__Support	I totally agree with this. I don't understand how much more it will take before humans do something to make significant changes. We are often reactive instead of proactive but in this case our efforts will most likely be to late to significantly alter the course we are on.
__label__Support	I agree that big business is only interested in the profits they can make and not at all interested in the citizens and their welfare
__label__Attack	I think there is another group that is probably more a majority than the two groups mentioned. That group is the people who do care about the environment but is overwhelmed by the sheer cost and magnitude of the many things they are told they should be doing while also trying to navigate their own lives. And when they don't scream vocally about saving everything, they get accused of being part of the exploiting group.
__label__Position	There must be one day lock down for every month to maintain the pollution which we are experiencing through lock down for corona
__label__Position	Countries need not to spend much for this. It must initiate some compulsory programs and stop producing vehicles that depends on petrol etc
__label__Attack	look into all that gas cars require before you are so quick to promote them.
__label__Support	L'avantage réside dans la baisse de pollution des grands centres urbains. Mais le réchauffement global ne baissera pas comme cela
__label__Position	Climate change is happening and speeding up as we go on. It should be the #1 priority for EVERYONE to find ways to resolve this. PERIOD
__label__Attack	This should have been thought about many years ago. I believe things are too far gone to ever be able to get the planet back to normal again
__label__Support	This is the one problem that no one on this planet can run from. Your ignorance, your disbelief and even you money can only save you for so long. There is no coming back from making our planet nonviable for all living things.
__label__Attack	It cannot be the number one priority for developing countries and people that are struggling with poverty. They are the people contributing less to climate change, and often pay more consequences for it. Priority to act should be ordered by our responsibility in the disaster!
__label__Position	I think climate change is a problem, but has been brought about not by the average citizens of the world but by the governments and big corporations who control us. We are deceived and being lied to by global organizations such as the World Economic Forum who want to take over and control the planet
__label__Support	Absolutely right, we are in the hands of corporate business man. But we can change this situation by changing our lifestlyes.
__label__Attack	The world is changing in terms of human empowerment and the connectedness of the individual and the transparency of the powers that be. The opinions of the people CAN be heard and change is possible. Humanity needs to work together and gain strength from one another.
__label__Attack	I don't think that's true anymore - working in a large corporation, 5 years ago, we would have never talked about sustainability, been willing to pay more for anything sustainable, or frankly, really been concerned. Now, we have no real choice - consumers are simply demanding it.
__label__Attack	This conversation helps us to think more regard this issue, we are learning more. Our conscience makes us alert and we will work for it. At least from our home.
__label__Attack	If we don't ask corporations to step in and get involved, then we're ignoring the biggest contributor of this issue - EVERYBODY needs to be involved.
__label__Attack	This is partially true, but fails to account for the fact that we couldn't possibly plant enough trees to absorb all of the CO2 produced. Not enough space on the Earth. And methane.
__label__Support	The CO2 level increases the most reason for climate change because the CO2 level increase it cause the air pollution.The pollution range increase is the problem of climate change.So I agree with you.
__label__Attack	The statement is correct we need to talk about climate change for future because it is more helpful for the future generation. The federal government need to take the step about the climate change so it may be helpful for the upcoming generation.
__label__Position	Some awareness is now spreading among the people. It should be expanded. Each and everyone must talk about this, everyone's responsibility in climate change. We all should stop avoiding plastics and co2 emissions. Every child must teach this in school. We need a kids should aware like Greta Thunberg.
__label__Position	This is very true, but then isn't it time to start before it gets to be a worse situation? The economic impacts are starting to hit now.
__label__Position	If we identify the negative feedback loops and break them, then we have a chance of slowing or even reversing climate change
__label__Position	Obviously it is getting harder. Each year more damage is done and we cannot deny the inevitable.
__label__Support	More should be focused on identifying the negative feedback and focusing on the positive aspects
__label__Position	Policy makers have vested interests with industry to ignore signals of overshoot and straining risks. Whatever action will be taken too late and there is no way to prevent feedback loops
__label__Position	I think it can be reversed, but it's going to take a collective effort from a lot of individuals to start this process.
__label__Position	I think that growing more trees can reverse the adverse effects of manmade climate change. Trees release fresh oxygen. Protecting the environment is the key to reversing the harmful effects of climate change. It is most important to preserve the natural environment and plant more trees. Trees release oxygen which is very good for health.
__label__Position	Everyone want to know about the climate change increase due to Manmade cause.So first we want start to reduce the waste level in our home.It leads to changes in the society if else we will face the huge climate changes in coming decades.
__label__Support	More emphasis on the smaller, daily things we can do to reduce waste would probably allow us to see change more quickly than being shamed about every product we use that might potentially be bad for the environment. Manufacturers can be a big part of that. If there are no cheap, dangerous plastic shopping bags made, then they won't be part of our homes that we need to deal with. It's definitely a group effort.
__label__Position	More effort is needed to raise the awareness in humans.If else the climate change cause the humans lives matter.Future decades will damaged by climate change.
__label__Support	We need to talk more about the climate change because the future generation will affect due to the climate change. The atmosphere and oceans are already filled with CO2. They can’t take any longer . If they might , we might not be experiencing the rapid global climate change we experience daily. So we need to protect climate for our future generation.
__label__Position	The climate change is the major important issue in current situation because the emission of CO2 content is more in the air so it will affect the ozone layer and this will become the major issue for the earth so we need to take care of our earth by controlling the climate change. We need to protect our earth for our future generation so we need to take a step based on the climate change.
__label__Position	The climate change is the major issue in the current environment so we need to protect our environment by controlling the air pollution.
__label__Position	if we install proper home insulation the we could make a real change to some extent
__label__Position	I don't feel that climate change is all man made, but we should be doing things to help the earth in general.
__label__Support	Educating people (such as making it mandatory in the school system) on how to reverse climate change can give people the option to make positive changes to the situation.
__label__Attack	All we can do is reduce our impact but not reverse it.Unfortunately is statistically inevitable
__label__Position	Billionaires who make money by killing planet earth, should be shot to death. They are not understanding what they are doing. Their aim is only money.
__label__Attack	What point is there in preserving our climate for humanity, if, by taking these sorts of actions, we lose our collective humanity? Better for the human race to go extinct than to degrade to barbaric form of behavior advocated for in this argument.
__label__Position	Some damage towards the climate is currently irreversible to prevent reversal in time.
__label__Attack	Even though damage is done, there are ways to counter the damage through other actions. If enough of these are done, they can cumulatively overpower the irreversible actions and thus reduce climate change as a net overall.
__label__Support	Agree, the biggest contributors of CO2 emissions (USA and China) should do the most effort to reverse this
__label__Attack	I disagree even an agreemtn for other countries no matter how weak could be a good thing to do!
__label__Position	I feel that manmade climate change can be reversed by everyone working together and making sacrifices to improve the environment. It will be made possible by people figuring out ways to save on carbon emissions instead of taking the easiest route. If we can do that in more ways than one, we should be able to save the planet.
__label__Support	You're totaly right. the problem is the power of consumption over our minds. I see the appeal it has on children. To fight against it, we must extract ourselves from the big market and the advertising that accompanies it
__label__Position	Need to review our system of economic growth. The planet cannot provide for our ubris, our will to infinite power. We must limit the objectives and return to functioning in line with limited resources.
__label__Position	We need to establish individual flight quotas. For example, one long-haul flight per person every 5 years
__label__Support	Agree, bio-fuels is not a clean form of energy. Rich countries support it as a cheap form of energy, yet it has a high CO2 profile
__label__Attack	While trying to sort. climate change, we cannot just shut the economy off, so yes we need cheap energy
__label__Position	The Economist published a very interesting Video-Analysis of COP2026 Analysis of COP26 https://www.economist.com/climate-change
__label__Support	Only vegetarian would be good for earth is just a myth. You either go fully vegan or you are just kidding yourself
__label__Attack	Which environment benefits do you mean?
__label__Attack	A small amount of dairy and eggs is quite sustainable. The author is conflating large scale meat farming with small scale milk and egg production.
__label__Attack	Choosing an unsustainable diet, e.g. meat-eating, is not only affecting you but also the whole planet that we live in. The principle of freedom cited there, applies up to the point it violates other's freedoms.
__label__Position	This would be much more ethical
__label__Position	Vegan way of eating and living is the only sustainable (for our planet) lifestyle
__label__Attack	Many cultures include meat of some kind as part of their daily choices. Veganism as a movement reflects just a small part of humanity.
__label__Attack	There are far more sustainablity actions that should be taken before dietary constrictions, like reducing the loop of consumption in the US which is based on inflation and debt generation.
__label__Support	Agree, in terms of cost, is an extremely -therefore not sustainable- expensive lifestyle. Only applicable to western societies
__label__Position	no
__label__Support	I should tell you why i agree, right?
__label__Position	writing in the box
__label__Support	There is a growing body of evidence that everybody - not just the vulnerable - wearing masks significantly reduces the viral load in a confined space.
__label__Position	I believe that mandatory mask-wearing policies infringe upon personal liberty, and that mask mandates are politicized and are manipulative tactics by certain politicians and special interest groups as ways to increase state control
__label__Attack	I disagree - these policies must be mandated otherwise when they are voluntary (like in the UK now) people don't wear them - as a result infection rates remain high
__label__Support	indeed
__label__Position	living with covid will need much new investment in primary care
__label__Support	I agree, the fact that newspaper are not able to provide a fair and safe discussion space it is not a reason to reduce free speech
__label__Attack	I agree
__label__Support	That is a valid point , but completely removing the comment section is not the best solution for it
__label__Support	A certain language criteria would be a better solution , restricting the limitations to ways of expression only
__label__Position	No, everyone has freedom of speech, citizen opinions should be heard just as journalists are.
__label__Position	No,I think the comment space should be there, but there can be another choice for people to mute the space who don't want to see them.
__label__Support	yes, maybe like how filtering particular words are put into social media platforms like facebook, which allows particular words to be banned from posting.
__label__Support	I agree, a filter can be used to have a control over the hatred and words used, without restraining people too much. This can improve the way people write and make them rethink what they are writing if they want to express disagreement of some sort. You can express a point in different ways and it doesn ́t always have to be in a rude manner
__label__Position	Yes it can avoid a lot of arguments and harrasments
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I totally agree with this point because I think freedom of speech is fundamental in a modern and democratic society but at the same time we cannot avoid the fact that online hate speech have become a problem and we should deal with it
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Position	No, it's not a fair choice. But we have to admit that there are also some shortcomings of current design of comment space, since hate sometimes reproduce hate, rather than solving problems. I would say BCAUSE is better designed than the simple comment space.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Support	I think hate pushing is wrong.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	no removing the platform is not the solution to limit hate speech rather it would be suitable to have some sort of filtration or observance of the verbal allowance
__label__Position	noo it will limit freedom of speech. But there should be a little censorship
__label__Position	Yess, thats totally correct. In order to reduce hate speeches there shoyld not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Attack	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	No, the newspaper should represent freedom for all kinds of speech.
__label__Position	I agree, not only to reduce hate speech but also to limit false freedom in participation
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	removing the comment space from newspapers is not a way, there should be a parallel monitor that filters comments as well as bots that flag comments
__label__Position	Yes,because hate speech is not worth protecting,it only has bad effects.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Position	From my point of view, it is highly depends on the society and the behavarioul thoughts of people in that society. there are always disagree comments but as long as they are positive to writer and the subject itself. it can work. and if this hate can be spread in other thoughts and these comments are destructive so it can be limited, otherwise there is no need to removing this part.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	There shouldn't be hate speeches if the articles don't provoke it. The newspaper has to take charge of what it can provoke to its reader, and thus avoid those speeches. The comment space shouldn't be removed.
__label__Position	I think there should be freedom of speech and expression of opinions. However, people should get an education first in order to create a positive and useful environment.
__label__Position	No, discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	A lot depends upon how it's implemented. If it's just a free-for-all without any sort of reputation system, we know that it will become a cesspool. If carefully designed, it can be a useful resource. Fair to remove? I think it's up to the newspaper to decide if they want to support such a resource.
__label__Position	No, I think limiting people's capacity to comment would simply add a new layer to the hate feeling. Plus, it takes away the possibility of capturing perceptions on sensible topics. Fact identifiers though, could be useful to avoid disinformation.
__label__Position	Sometimes - though counter-intuitative - disallowing free speech, you are safeguarding freedom of speech!
__label__Support	Indeed, because it is a tool made by human, it might have a creator bias
__label__Attack	extreme is also an apinion as long as it isnt damaging or offensive
__label__Attack	Ethical opinions cannot be “measured”. There is certain subjectivity when taking about ethics
__label__Support	It is hard to actually define the "offensiveness" of a statement.
__label__Position	A key factor that could make filtering unfair is the fact that is done merely by automatic detection tools without human vetting or control.
__label__Attack	Automatic filtering technology can be improved continuously and I think it would reach an adequate level of censoring without limiting freedom of speech. Some social networks like Instagram already give an option for users to select if they want to see hate speech or not
__label__Attack	humans are not usually biased
__label__Attack	You give for granted that the automatic is half stupid and the human is a well intentioned agent
__label__Attack	I think that the human capital to employe human vetting would not be sufficient in a first filtering phase
__label__Support	Yes, this is a very crucial point. Something which is hate speech for a particular ideology might not be so for others.
__label__Position	Key factors include ethical point of intervention along with just mere word filtering. Because sometime the message that was thought to be sent across might be pure but because of wrong choices of words, it can get filtered out.
__label__Attack	there is a distinction between comments that are made directly in a discriminative way and comments that create a dialogue.
__label__Position	The easy way for a bot or system to analyze what could be a hate speech could be to select certain words that are usually associated to descrimination. This could be developed by studying existing comments and seeing what are the most repeated dialogues.
__label__Position	The most important question about filtering mechanisms is who controls them and how much power they have or should have. The concern for using a filter mechanism should be to hire a neutral service provider for it. This should be confirmed by certificates or similar from independent institutions so that credibility is established.
__label__Attack	No certificates should be needed to detect a hate comments, it comes to ethics and morality
__label__Position	factors that are merely based on "scam reports" or when someone reports an individual for wrong content just by selecting certain options, which are many generalization
__label__Attack	no
__label__Position	Diversity is important so that all sides are heard
__label__Support	Research and twenty one years experience suggests that there is little doubt that many people from different parts of civil society feel disconnected or excluded from environmental action and discussion at just the time when the environmental sector is working to develop and expand engagement. There is is a need on both sides to be heard, listened to and understood.
__label__Attack	It has also been suggested, that there is an urgent need to engage with influential stakeholders. Therefore focusing on poorer and excluded communities, the so-called ‘hard to reach' may not deliver the highest possible level of cuts in carbon emissions for the resources spent.
__label__Support	Moral and ethical values (e.g. equality, right to clean healthy environment) shape fair environmental and social change. It should ensure that excluded stakeholders get to part in decisions that affect their environment and quality of life.
__label__Support	Diversity helps decisions to be more informed and effective. Ensuring everybody's voices are heard helps to meet the needs of all members of the community.
__label__Support	The poorest communities in the UK are amongst the most negatively affected by the causes and consequences of climate change. We need different and low-carbon ways to develop prosperity and meet the aspirations of these communities as part of a strategy to tackle poverty and inequality. It will be essential that those suffering the effects of poverty and those who represent their interests are involved in this work.
__label__Position	There are a number of important stakeholders in this work and a fast growing body of emerging good practice ion the UK and elsewhere. It will be hard for people to keep up to date with this and people working in one area (e.g. climate and the built environment) may find it hard to follow other areas. it would be helpful to have an online repository of key information that could develop out of this initial discussion. But some organisation or agency will need to step up and host this.

__label__Position	Inconsistent application of planning policy and conservation guidance means that improvement proposals meet with widely different and unpredictable responses in addition to delays caused by the strained planning system.
__label__Support	"Local planners, architects, engineers, and local homeowners should be working together to develop local archetypes that can set homes on their own journey to net-zero.

__label__Support	Bang on being listed and heritage is no excuse to cutting carbon (Chit Chong)
__label__Support	I don't necessarily disagree, but solutions would include funding the planning system better and requiring LPAs to have conservation advice, both of which would aid early engagement and head off the development of proposals that are likely to be refused. Substantial energy efficiency improvements can be made for most buildings, including listed ones, without planning permission or listed building consent. Concentrate on quick wins.
__label__Position	Buildings that are not on a net zero pathway are in danger of being down valued by finance providers facing their own targets for financed emission reductions.
__label__Support	This is increasingly the case, not only because they cost more to run, but also that, by not being on a clear improvement pathway, any potential purchaser or leaseholder will conclude their useful life is much shorter than it would otherwise be (i.e. for properties that are on a net zer pathway).
__label__Attack	This might be true, but the key is developing the pathway, which means advice. Cheap access to more qualified advisors is the solution, not downgrading heritage value in the planning balance.
__label__Support	Finding ways to repair heritage buildings in a cost-effective way is essential to preserve heritage assets. If too costly people will not buy such buildings and they will lose value. (Anna Beckett, Symmetrys)
__label__Attack	I don't agree that upgrades are always more expensive in heritage settings; heating controls don't cost more, and secondary glazing is cheaper than window replacement, as well as saving more carbon emisisons on a whole life basis. Appropriate materials are currently less available, but fitting inappropriate materials is already against current building codes of practice; urgent training for the building industry in appropriate materials would result in increased demand and scaled-up production, driving costs down.

__label__Position	Anna Beckett from Symmetrys looks at the problem from a sustainability point of view rather than a building and heritage perspective.

__label__Support	I agree
__label__Support	exactly. One of the root causes is poor education and people not knowing any better, as is stated in this post by United nations: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/impact-and-prevention/preventive-role-of-education. on the UN post, it is said that: "The United Nations Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech places specific emphasis on the transformative power of education as a fundamental tool to address the root causes and drivers of hate speech, and to promote peaceful, inclusive and just societies for all" as they have realised how big of an impact education has on reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	people will always have something foul to say. it is not really practical for one to stop people from hate speech. however I think if maybe there is a clear message before commenting that notify people about the implications of hate speech... also if an automated word detecter can be implemented to pick up certain words that are considered hate speech can assist in making sure that people do not write any hate speech on the comment section.
__label__Position	This can be done by assigning moderators to read comments and filter out those that classify as hate speech.
__label__Position	The comment section should have moderators that instill standards that participants have to follow.
__label__Position	I believe that removing the comment space from the online newspapers is definitely not a fair choice in a democratic society. Democracy advocates for the inclusion of all members of society, including their views on any issues. However, it does not warrant hate speech and online bullying. The best way to reduce hate speech can be to find an IT solution that can automatically block users that utter hate speech on the online platforms
__label__Position	Removing the comment space will not constitute a fair way of dealing with this issue. Maybe keeping the comment section and restricting each users comment ability would be a bette r option
__label__Attack	I disagree, I think there is no difference on both platforms.
__label__Position	The words chosen to be used are very essential when in comes to the reader and a writer. The content that is viewed as a hate speech should not be shown to the other readers. It should automatically give a warning to the writer and after 3 warnings they should be blocked as they do not comply with the terms and conditions.
__label__Support	This makes sense, agreed
__label__Position	Newspapers should assess which articles are suitable for readers comments and only allow comments on these articles. Clear guidelines regarding the use of comment sections should be provided to readers and those who breach the guidelines should be banned from posting further comments. The use of I.T. tools and human moderators could be combined to oversee the comment sections and ensure that the guidelines are followed.
__label__Position	Online users will now be aware that their negative online behavior will have consequences, and this feature will allow healthy online conversations to take place without any arguments.
__label__Position	I have to disagree with this, as in my opinion it is the responsibility of the newspaper websites to police it to some degree. If we look at this article: https://zdjp.si/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/poyhtari.pdf it is said that : "The study shows that moderation is not the only solution to prevent hate speech and cyberhate, but generally, the whole structure of the comment fi elds has been designed in a way that effi - ciently prevents problematic content. The number of available discussions and the practice of pre- or postmoderation dictate, how freely people can participate and comment. Finnish and British sites allow the most discussion, while Swedish and Dutch news sites prefer selected discussions, moderated by professional moderation companies." so because of this, i think that newspaper websites have great tools to control and deny hatespeech.
__label__Position	There needs to be a comment section in order for readers to engage and learn.
__label__Position	I absolutely agree with this position. It is critical not to be silenced, free speech is a right
__label__Position	I stand with the abolition of online hate speech through the moderation of newspaper platforms, or the removal of the comment section altogether. If the latter is chosen, then comments should be allowed on third party platforms such as twitter and facebook... If the comments are identified as hate speech, it is then the third party platform's duty to deal with it.
__label__Position	Newspapers should have a system in place for allowing hate speech comments to be reported so that they can be removed, and constantly monitoring comments to see which ones have hate speech might be problematic and if there are many hate speech comments, then it may be appropriate to temporarily remove the comment section and or ban the users of the hate speech comments.
__label__Position	Turning off the comment section reduces the average time spent on news websites, a study has found, and it did not leave a good impression on those who noticed that their comments were removed. https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2020/10/research-proves-that-removing-comment.html
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	I definitely agree with this view point. Its important to have free speech when addressed correctly
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Attack	I have to disagree with this, as giving an opinion that is opposite to the other person's opinion is completely different that using hate speech to deliver the message. You can have free speech and hate speech banning at the same time working together. Using AI to spot hatespeech keywords, while still allowing people to argue and have different opinions, as long as they aren't doing it the wrong way.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	Agreed, this article shares the same views. Its should not be the Newspaper taking accountability
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Attack	https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/8/15/20806384/social-media-hate-speech-bias-black-african-american-facebook-twitter Agreed. Some research suggests algorithms can be biased.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Support	Absolutely, the issue of sharing inflammatory or misleading news is important to address and change. News outlets are responsible for how they present their stories and how the narrative changes in the comment section below. They're also responsible for the real world violence as a result of willingly hosting hate speech on their platform whether they're active or inactive on their handling of the comments sections.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	Define aggressive, some reddit subs ban gendered language which is over moderation in my opinion when you look at the content of a word not the technical definition of it sometimes. Like saying "I'm having a bitch of a time" vs "you're a bitch".
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Position	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	Education only goes so far - some people will just ignore this policy. Perhaps just removing hate speech manually, or having a review process so only non-hate speech comments are published may be better.
__label__Support	I agree and disagree, how do you educate someone who intentionally tries to misunderstand you because it doesn't support their current views". But why give up entirely just because the odds are stacked against you for effectively swaying them from hateful thoughts. I think the better question is how do you sway someone who is firmly attached to hate speech? And how can we teach the people who care about human rights to talk to the less reasonable hate speech people in a way that penetrates their firmly held belief systems?
__label__Attack	At the same time, people have a right to comment and discuss - the more we engage with difficult topics and debate, the more we practice our critical thinking, and I think we owe the average commenter more credit than thinking they can't differentiate between opinion and fact.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	However, it might also discourage people from leaving comments generally as it is quite difficult to leave a response and not many people would go through that much effort to say something, which there is a risk of being personally identified as well.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	Then it would always be the medias word over the public
__label__Attack	That's not true, there are millions of platforms to hold conversation about news articles without talking directly under them. Everything they right is open to public scrutiny.
__label__Attack	But the major newspapers are already owned by large corporations who have vested interest in political parties and financial matters. It is hard for liberal or independent news to break through the noise. Comments help to balance the conversation.
__label__Attack	At the same time, this seems like it would have such potential for corruption - who programmes the software? Newspaper sites could simple auto-remove any comments that disagree with them.
__label__Support	I completely agree!
__label__Position	Moderating comments sections is a lot of work to do manually, the individuals tasked with it would burn out in short time trying to manage that effectively while also having to read hateful garbage all day. If there was a system to remove hate speech it needs to be automated with an algorithm that catches certain words, then reviewed manually when someone disagrees with the content removed and it not being against guidelines. We use guidelines for everything including media regulations for accurate reporting or having to retract when information is not accurate. It's no different in the comments section, it doesn't remove free speech it regulates it to create a healthy environment to have a conversation in. Over moderation can have as severe of an effect as under, it has to be a system that takes in common complaints from both sides. Not the hate speech side per say but the sides of people who are pro free flowing conversation and those who want more shielding to avoid extremist echo chambers.
__label__Support	https://time.com/5739688/facebook-hate-speech-languages/ This is especially true because not all people speak the language! An algorithm would be best, but there are still some technical issues that we need to address.
__label__Position	Identifying users with hate speech and restricting their accounts from using the platform and commenting on it.
__label__Support	Absolutely, we should support hate speech or encourage it by allowing multiple infractions to be pass by unpunished.
__label__Attack	However people who don't feel heard will often go to where they do feel heard. So finding a way to balance the correction of their hateful views while restricting their access for sharing them is the struggle.
__label__Position	i am against the removal of the comment section and i believe that regulations and clear rules are the way to go, have systems put into place and enforce the rules. let there be punishable offences for rule breakers.
__label__Position	by blocking users who violate 'hate speech rules', i feel it should be clearly stated what hate speech is.
__label__Position	When we read comments it can have two effects, one is it changes our initial position, another is it reinforces what we already believe. Because bias confirmation is so strong it's important to decide which capacity is greater, the need for validation or the ability to critically think and be flexible in thinking. Most societies shape people to look for bias confirmation though so in reality the outcome is more frequently people reaffirming what they already believed rather than being swayed by any logic no matter how logical it is.
__label__Position	I believe the following article could provide more information on hate speech, not only in the context of this discussion but as a whole and what can be done to combat it. https://www.stompoutbullying.org/blog/hate-speech
__label__Attack	Education is a great tool but essentially your website gives the solution without the steps. First people need to learn how to disarm the person they're debating with to educate them, which most people don't have the finesse to do. How do you change someones views when they're defensive from start to finish of your conversation?
__label__Position	Medium security algorithms can flag the words most commonly used for hate speech, humans will have to update as it progresses because once communities recognize they're banned they come up with work around words using symbols, spaces or whole new words.
__label__Position	I believe in democracy, equality and freedom of speech. However I do not believe in hate speech therefore I believe that newspaper websites should keep to the original essence of the newspaper and not a comment section, as other newspaper websites with comment section seem to spread fake news. I think that since we live in a social media world, hence newspaper websites can post their articles on them so that people can share their views on the article.

__label__Position	Some of the comment section of some newspaper articles are not worth reading and may sometimes spoil the reading experience. https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/
__label__Position	I believe that freedom of speech is important but freedom of speech should not be taken for granted and where a person would seek to take it away from others, then they may lose it themselves. From this position, I would not agree with removing the comment section on online newspapers because this is a lazy way of dealing with the issue. I would rather see moderation of hate speech. I think removing comment sections changes nobody's mind and stifles debate. It would not reduce polarisation to remove comment sections. I have often seen people dealing effectively with trolls and hate speakers themselves anyway apart from moderators. Hiding a problem does not stop the problem. It fuels polarisation to make division invisible. It also means that media can slant a particular article in a chosen direction and this cannot be challenged, even by those affected, without being able to comment. So in this respect, having no comment section can increase injustice, not reduce it. Ultimately, a person can and should be banned from commenting if they are consistently abusive towards others.
__label__Position	Some of the ideas here are interesting. Adding personal data before commenting to deter hate speech, for example, but in itself that seems open to abuse as well - although I guess data protection would apply to the information but would you always trust that this is applied? Also do we all want to be always personally associated with our comments, what if we do change or mind or temper our views? Sometimes being anonymous is important and helps you speak freely, isn't only abusive people who can benefit from being anonymous. Using data to track people down to re-educate them feels like an abuse of power and a step too far. And re-educate along what lines? Using algorithms seems like a good idea but as we have seen with facebook, it doesn't always work very well. However, it may be a blunt tool but it might be the best we have to work with given that it is a good point that the sheer volume of moderation that might be needed by people employed by the media to do so (either directly or via a third party, if you accept they have a responsibility to do this, which I do). Ultimately, I liked best the idea of taking a median of views and making that the regulation that governs the practice. The idea that this includes people and doesn't drive them into echo chambers. I think it is important the nuance isn't lost. Not everyone who sits in far right echo chambers, for example, ends up killing people in the mall. Hate rhetoric can be challenged if people can engage with each other. I have seen this happen. To answer the question, I would say that setting the rules clearly using various ways of presenting the information (as has been discussed) is really useful to engage people with the process, to check understanding. Using flagging, software or/and by contributors also useful with penalties for consistent abuse. Moderation by staff or third party to keep the human element with awareness and discussion of bias (encoded in software and also in us). A clear step by step process that can end in a ban. All of this is time consuming and expensive but necessary if you believe that people can change their minds, can be influenced positively by others, that free speech is important.
__label__Attack	I feel that in this case, by getting rid of hate speech, I feel that it is worth sacrificing a part of free speech in order to make everyone feel comfortable.
__label__Position	Comment sections should be moderated for hate speech with specific guidelines on what constitutes this. Disagreement, or otherwise uncivil comments should still be permitted.
__label__Position	I think that the space should be monitored and should state on top of the space that hate speech is not acceptable and will be removed.
__label__Position	delete hater comments and monitor them and ban them.
__label__Position	Create a automated system that captures certain phrases or words and automatically flags and bans them.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	Perhaps we could create a team whose job is to moderate comments, and they can be paid for what they do? In terms of flagging, we might create a questionnaire asking them what exactly is hateful about the comment.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Attack	We shape our social lives in physical space all the time. We now 'live' also in a digital world. We can shape our digital lives and we must do this by not taking the "easy" way out, by using the tools at our disposal and by questioning and creating new tools to control our digital space.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	They rob marginalized communities of their rights by being hateful, that doesn't get priority over the actual people facing violence as a result of their shitty actions.
__label__Attack	If a man created a radio show, attacking the 'western' world, not actively engaging in war, terrorism or the sort, but speaking on it being a necessary evil... e.c.t. I for one would never call that and acceptable part of free spee ch and i know you wouldn't either
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	"Comments are often regarded as a right but they can do more harm than good. In the absence of strict moderation, we’d be much better off without them"
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	I agree, newspapers should remain impartial as much as possibe and outsource the management to a third party that most consumers of media can agree on to form that structure for defining and removing comments.
__label__Attack	It would be irresponsible for newspaper publications to not police comments as they are giving the platform for people to voice their opinions. Them turning a blind eye to hate speech could be mistaken as them endorsing or condoning those utterances. The following article serves to support my stance and should you wish maybe you can take a second to read though it. https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	Everyone has a different interpretation of what could be aggressive. The soultion would be to remove the comment section and people can go to many different forums if they want to discuss articles
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	re-education will not help some people
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Position	I think it is not the correct thing to do as it makes it a one sided interaction and bars further exploration of the topic. The solution in my view would be to have the posts read first by an appointed party before being approved to go live.
__label__Position	I believe its fair because to remove the comment space in all newspaper this way it helps to create more peace and than more hate speech. i alot hate speech on an online newspaper which tend to result in insults for others who are trying to express their opinions. Removing it will be whole lot better to prevent such hate speech from happening again.
__label__Position	I see that most people have the same idea as I have of having moderated. I did not think about what the guidelines could be and how censoring could be a contributing factor to my stand on having comments moderated, but it still seems like the best solution.
__label__Support	Guidelines could be very useful to set up rules for what is and isn't allowed on the website. Then, everyone has a clear understanding of the moderator's goals and reasonings.
__label__Position	All in all, we'd need to define hate speech, offensive comments/topics, problematic/controversial themes and messages/keywords. Then, we can think about the implementation of guidelines, bans, filters and moderators.
__label__Position	the websites should have built in AI that detects certain words or strings of words that may be deemed as hate speech and censor them
__label__Position	another useful method that other platform use is to have a group of moderators that will check for such comments and block the accounts responsible for the hate speech
__label__Position	If considering implementing content moderation, using AI may be the best solution for popular sites with a lot of engagement. Especially for filtering out explicit words and phrases, which would be the most unbiased type of moderation. There will of course be those who try to evade the filtering by using special characters in place of letters, but there could be a setting that automatically filters instances of too many special characters, as it could be considered as spam. See article: https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/06/14/the-growing-role-of-ai-in-content-moderation/?sh=3f6abc9d4a17
__label__Position	everyone has the right to freedom of speech even if we do not agree to their view of opinion but in the end it creates so much hate amongst other commentators as well.
__label__Position	Being fair as to reduce hate comments and allow the readers to engage with what's being communicated to them, introducing words filters and censors will work perfectly. See below: https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CAQQw7AJahcKEwiIqLLkm-_6AhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAg&url=https%3A%2F%2Frm.coe.int%2Fstarting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online%2F16809c85ea&psig=AOvVaw27EvyEVPkE-0xNg9nVZtKL&ust=1666369217616059
__label__Position	It sets a common ground, that is why people tend to use it. Hate speech is a reflection of the negative impact of news on the sociocognitive interface between discourse and society. It is important to have the open spaces to interact, but they should be regulated. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211695819301412
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	I agree. If deleting comments is left to a group of a moderators, those human beings inevitably have their own personal opinion and will take a certain stance on any topic. This gives some individuals an unfair amount of power, and it can very well result in, for lack of a better word, "echo-chambers" where the vast majority of comments support a certain stance and anyone who criticizes that stance will get dogpiled.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	This is not a realistic approach at this time. With the definition of "hate speech" becoming more and more loose and up for interpretation, this sets a dangerous precedent of government and law enforcement overreach. The only time where law enforcement may need to get involved is with blatant calls to violence - physical violence - or inciting hatred against a targeted individual or group. I agree somewhat with this point, but not in the direction things are starting to head in today's times.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.

__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours

__label__Support	I agree
__label__Support	you are very correct
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.

__label__Position	The best thing would be to have some sort of app that monitors and regulate the language used. in a case where hate speech is found in a comment, the sentence should be blurred out.
__label__Support	I agree, this sounds like a sensible solution.
__label__Position	people should have values and respect for others.Just like facebook written words are monitored and people already know these rules.A set of rules should be set
__label__Position	cancelling the comment section wont be viable as the main aim is not to eliminate.
__label__Attack	removing the comment section will drive traffic away and decrease the amount of time readers engage with the newspaper.
__label__Position	Taking away the comments section would feel like an enfringement on everyones right to freedom of speech. Rather a limitation of what can be said sounds better. Guidelines are made for that
__label__Position	I think the newspaper website should not eliminate the space comments but rather create a merchanism or system that will allow comments to be vetted first by the editorial team before the comment can actually be visible for everyone to see it. the system could be in a such a way that it immediately flags down any comment that violate netiquette
__label__Attack	Hate speech is called hate speech for a reason. ALso it is not protected under the guise of freedom of speech. Not forgetting that with every right theres subsequent responsibilities
__label__Attack	Not all opinions are valid. Some people should keep their hateful opinions to themselves. https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation

__label__Attack	https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/05/reader-comments-on-news-sites-we-want-to-hear-what-your-publication-does/ This article highlights what effect hate speech has on readers in the comments sections
__label__Position	spending time trying to edit out the comment section might also be costly for the newspaper when they could spend that time and effort doing something else.
__label__Position	Instead of removing the comment section newspapers can try and look up new and different ways to facilitate their reader engagement.
__label__Support	Agreed, just a simple implementation of guidelines can go a long way just as stated in the following article https://help.ft.com/faq/commenting-on-articles/what-are-your-commenting-guidelines/
__label__Position	I think it is necessary to be more open about people's views and comments rather than merely discarding them. I think being a little bit more engaging and trying to understand why certain people hold particular views even if they may appear toxic may help us understand them and in the process help us to engage with them and hopefully win them from such radical ideas.
__label__Support	I agree with the main idea, but people who spew hate speech aren't exactly open to being educated.
__label__Attack	I do agree that sometimes people can mistake different opinions as hate speech but I do think it is quite easy to understand that hate speech involves language that disrespect the person you are talking to
__label__Position	We ought to strike some balance by protecting other people at the same time and thus I am of the opinion that while we may be engaging to almost everyone we should have an algorithm in place that will help us filter out dangerous comments. At the end of the day, what we do not need are hateful comments therefore we should not dismiss along with positive comments that may help our society investigate certain areas of our lives that need critical attention.
__label__Attack	that might be too much work
__label__Position	read the comments and give your best opinion
__label__Position	I'm not against comments per se. I think this The New York Times article raises a few good points about media bias and public engagement. Perhaps more accountability might hep reduce hate speech in the comments. So many people hide behind their anonymity online and express divisive ideas just to troll and provoke - if they had to post under their real names or with links to their social media accounts, they might think twice before posting hateful opinions. https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/04/18/have-comment-sections-on-news-media-websites-failed/despite-flaws-comments-are-good-for-public-discourse
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	I actually agree. Just have the news present a perspective. Readers can agree or disagree on their own.
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Support	I agree,that way people aren't bullied online.
__label__Position	we should try to make the number of words a person can use to respond because usually people wit hate hate speech write long responses
__label__Position	Freedom of speech is an essential right and should always be respected. However, I believe that those websites should obviously monitor comments for hate speech and other dangerous activities and remove those, as they most likely break their terms of services and also do not bring anything to whatever discussion may be going on. We can all disagree with each other without crossing a violent line, virtual or not.
__label__Position	Hate speech does not belong anywhere - but it is unfair to cancel or eliminate readers comments because people can not behave. a Automatic block should be placed on the site
__label__Position	there should be words provided in the comment section for a person to use and i those words there should be a mix of good and bad words but the bad ones should no to explicit
__label__Position	Through the use of moderators who monitor comments and remove hateful speech that can cause bullying or violence
__label__Position	Comments that containing words that are to be regarded as hate speech should be flagged as having words that contain hate speech and the reader can choose to view the comment or continue without seeing the details of the flagged comment
__label__Position	Using moderators helps to remove hateful speech.
__label__Position	We can do so by filtering keywords that are associated with hate speech.
__label__Position	people should be given the platform to comment but also be given selected and limited words to do so
__label__Position	I am against hate speech. But I do not think the right answer is to completely disregard the comment section. It's important to maintain freedom of speech and readers should be able to express their opinions about what is written
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Attack	Yes however, it would at least stop the effect hate speech has on others
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Attack	People still need the comment section since it allows for open conversation and allows for people to find like mnded individuals.
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Support	okay I hear you but I think that there are situation that do not need people to be rude but they just choose to.
__label__Support	i agree with this and awareness should be brought to the surface
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	There are some good points however in having news sites require users to submit data they risk each users' privacy and right to anonymity. This could be increadibly dangerous and would encourage people to stop using the site
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	" Blocking users or deleting comments because they express critical opinions offends the Constitution and principles of transparency" - https://www.aclu-nj.org/en/know-your-rights/when-public-officials-censor-you-social-media
__label__Attack	Some comments can be seen as hate speech but they are not hate speech. They will be taken down and that will prevent freedom of speech
__label__Support	i agree with this as it will be moderated then
__label__Support	Certain words can be detected by the program which are hate speech and removed
__label__Support	I agree with you
__label__Position	fair choice
__label__Position	There should be instructions given that state "No hate speech is allowed" before one can comment. if you fail to follow instructions , your comment will be dismissed.
__label__Position	Govern social media: Many of you who are reading this post are probably wondering how you can regulate social media without removing the freedom of the press. Education of the legal and ethical issues affecting the media can improve press freedom. Encourage victims and witnesses to come forward with information about crimes involving hate speech. Hate speech is still mostly invisible since many victims are unaware that they are being the targets of it.
__label__Position	This will not work for long term
__label__Position	The newspaper should inform their reader what their definition of "Hate Speech" is, then have moderators to censor/remove comments that would be classified as hate speech.
__label__Position	The issue with hate speech is how it affects others and as nice as it seems to be able to destroy it at its root by re-educating those who commit hate speech, it is more important to help reduce the wide spread effect of their hate speech as that can be faster to do. e.g., having morderators that check over comments that have flagged language. only then can the people who resort to hate speech should be dealt with by having strikes and bans to their account which wouldn't conflict with their anonymity. However, censorship is also a concern, Who decides what is hate speech and what isn't?
__label__Position	I think this is fair for now, so that people will understand why they can't comment, but in the mean time the newspaper should create an awareness and display on their newspaper and monitor/ delete hate speech from the comments
__label__Position	People should be allowed to say what they want, you cannot say something nice about anyone all the time
__label__Position	You can if you teach yourself to refrain from being a mean person.
__label__Position	A system should be developed to detect certain words that are considered as hate speech. This will help prevent or eliminate hate speech comments
__label__Support	Yes 100%
__label__Position	people have different opinions on what being mean is...
__label__Position	there is a study on this and a recommendation on an algorithm to detect hate speech. i believe there are already various algorithms out there that do this. Link: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/830/3/032006
__label__Position	The newspaper should have a fair definition of what defines "hate speech". The definition should be one, that many different political figures can publicly agree on.
__label__Position	I totally disagree, people are different
__label__Position	I think its important that people teach themselves to be kind in certain situations. if people learnt to be kind , the world would be a better place.
__label__Position	Most people tend to respond aggressively when they know that they are anonymous because they think that they cannot be held accountable for their actions (https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-24373-001)
__label__Position	Moderation seems to be the most reasonable solution to solve hate speech comments and there are various algorithms in place which can monitor platforms for hate speech and flag them (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/830/3/032006)
__label__Attack	It can be difficult to automate this monitoring
__label__Position	More suitable laws need to be put in place that are suited to the world of social media
__label__Position	By outright banning IP addresses which contribute hate speech to platforms, and investing in moderation through human resources and through text analysis tools.
__label__Position	By ensuring that proper identification and registration information is provided by users, who have to register in order to make comments.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.

__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Support	maybe get something to control what comes in and goes out
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?

__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Support	I agree!

__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	It would be hard for anyone to not be bias as we have different opinions on subjects and one might thing that the comment is appropriate and someone else might not think so. It can be subjective at times.
__label__Attack	I think this could be a good idea, but people will probably eventually find workarounds to avoid the censoring (as seen with spam bots using alternate characters in Youtube comments for example)
__label__Support	I agree a screening process could be effective in filtering comments.
__label__Position	Having a screening tool to sense the kind of speech used can be useful
__label__Support	this can work if they have a filtering system to filter out the the hate speech comments
__label__Position	Pages could have a filter system that blocks certain words
__label__Support	i agree with this comment,
__label__Position	There is much to be said for moderation strategies, as detailed here: https://www.medienanstalt-nrw.de/fileadmin/user_upload/materials_and_ordering_system/download/L202_Hateful-Commenting-Online.pdf
__label__Position	I agree that free speech should be honoured and upheld. That being said, newspapers are their own entities that should have autonomy over their interactions and comments from readers. Therefore, I think the use of moderators, filtering out certain offensive language, and strict and visible posting guidelines are good ways to reduce hate speech on these websites.
__label__Attack	I love the idea of implementing a filter/moderator so the respectful opinions are still allowed to be shared!
__label__Position	Totally agree with you.
__label__Position	No ways, I think it should be monitored. This technology is so advance now, i think it will be able to detect hate speech and alert the head of the newspaper and they should be responsible for removing it. Some people practice hate speech because they are one sided and comment sections sometimes helps them be enlightened.
__label__Position	The comment section should not be removed all together however it can be used to monitor the hate speech that is going on offline. Removing the comment section would mean losing insight that would be otherwise valuable to society. Take a look at this link down below for the importance of monitoring hate speech. https://akademie.dw.com/en/the-importance-of-monitoring-online-hate-speech/a-19104789
__label__Position	I don't believe that newspapers need comments from readers. I think if this has to be the case, the comments should be submitted and then moderated before posting, with perhaps select views from each side of arguments shared, in order to discourage hate speech, spam, views from those who clearly haven't read, etc.
__label__Position	The problem with directly challenging hate speech, as a focus, can actually reflect the biases of those doing so, or even software. This can lead to minorities actually being disproportianately flagged for hate speech, despite more often being the victims of this rhetoric online (https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/8/15/20806384/social-media-hate-speech-bias-black-african-american-facebook-twitter)

__label__Attack	They are a business and therefore hold the control over what is said in their comments.
__label__Attack	The possibilities of negative consequences of allowing hate speech are well-documented, including the violence in post-independence Kenya (iHub research).
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.

__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?

__label__Support	I support the filtering of comments instead of removing the comment section. A filtering systems should be put in place
__label__Position	I think we should just collect personal information. It works in South Korea. People will behave if their are not anonymous. Modertors are important too, but not enough,
__label__Position	I think it's probably better to know what a person is thinking, whether that's positive/neutral/negative than to just delete or ignore it. The idea of accountability and not hiding behind a user ID is a good one. People might actually begin to think about what they're saying before posting.
__label__Position	Maybe a possibility would be to ask for a minimum number of words, not to allow text in capital letters, to limit emoticons, not to allow certain words if too many, not to validate a text with too many mistakes.
__label__Position	comments should me moniotred without bias, they sould be monitored so that hate speech is removed and those who continue to comment with hate speech should be blocked. other platforms have moderators who have to review and approve comments before they become public
__label__Attack	that requires people who play by the rules
__label__Position	it ain't go work hate will always be there we build this society to be like this
__label__Position	But what about those who were going to give positive comments. I believe comments should just be monitored
__label__Attack	Monitoring and moderating is not enough. It wont solve the problem. Look at this study: https://www.cairn.info/revue-questions-de-communication-2020-2-page-529.htm
__label__Position	I think hate speech can be curved not by removing the people that spew it but rather, instead find ways to identify the profiles of the culprits and redirect them to a server with other people that spew hate where their comments are seen by other offenders and not people who are trying to engage in honest discussions
__label__Position	comment sections should not be removed as that will prevent those with positive comments form sharing their thoughts, they should instead be reviewed regulary so that hate speech is flagged and removed another solution is for comments to be approved by moderators before they go public
__label__Position	One way I propose to prevent hate speech is to remove anonymity online. Not being able to hide should limit cowardly behavior and thus reduce harmful speech.
__label__Attack	Whilst this isn't a terrible idea for this issue if everyone in comments sections is discoverable this could be very dangerous and turn what is a purely online hate problem into a real hate problem. Many people online have talked about issues with stalkers and being doxxed and this could make the problem a lot worse.
__label__Position	Freedom of speech is not absolute and people can have opinions but if those opinions insight violence and urge people to brake the law in anyway those opinions should not be allowed to be on any platform. https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/human-rights-and-anti-discrimination/human-rights-scrutiny/public-sector-guidance-sheets/right-freedom-opinion-and-expression
__label__Position	A documentation that I find interesting is available at the following link: https://netino.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/WAN-IFRA_Online_Commenting.pdf
__label__Position	I think that is a good idea but the amount of manpower needed to monitor millions of comments is just unfeasible and there is no ai or algorithm that exist that can detect with accuracy what is hate speech and what is being playful
__label__Attack	Hate speech can be damaging. Removing it also gives the platform more professionality
__label__Support	Professionality
__label__Position	this is a great idea there should also be a disclaimer that those who post hate speech will be banned from commenting or they will face a harsher punishment
__label__Position	hate speech can be harmful to the the person reading them as such those who comment using hate speech should be punished, the should be laws and regulations which prevent people from posting hateful content
__label__Position	From the previous arguments, it can be seen that although removing the comments section will disallow people to express themselves, when it comes to hate speech, the cons outweigh the pro's on terms of the comment section. If the comment section exists, there should be rules and regulations to control it.
__label__Position	Actually, AI is now being used to track hate speech, and is used to large companies with big user bases: https://www.newsy.com/stories/artificial-intelligence-is-used-to-track-down-hate-speech/#:~:text=Between%20January%20and%20March%202022,themes%20fall%20through%20the%20cracks.
__label__Position	have filters on the comments to block certain words and phrases
__label__Position	As good as ai and things may be at removing only hateful comments it's bound to mess up and it's a risky route to take taking the control out of the hands of humans for such a sensitive topic as to what is "hateful". Just removing the comment section is obviously far safer so it's understandable why some newspapers have done so. Honestly just having a stronger vetting process where every comment has to be approved manually is probably the safest procedure, but maybe have the person doing the vetting to be as unbiased as possible to try to only remove hateful comments and not stifle free speech.
__label__Position	Proof that it's basically impossible to remove hate speech since comments and hate speech are pretty much synonymous: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793
__label__Position	Put filters on comments that remove all vulger language or hate speech, only include fair and just arguements in newspaper websites
__label__Position	A machine filtering comments would have a positive affect as then people still have the freedom of speech without the vulger and disrespectful language
__label__Support	https://ifaamas.org/Proceedings/aamas2010/pdf/02%20Extended%20Abstracts/Blue/B-39.pdf
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Attack	OR we can try a a semi-automatic, holistic approach. I mean, it is important to let people talk about what they want, the comment section is an important place, where people can communicate. But some kind of moderation will be always needed. I find this study interesting: https://aclanthology.org/W18-4420.pdf
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Support	Everyone will be protected.
__label__Position	any hateful content should be removed and all other comments left
__label__Position	Jennifer P, I agree
__label__Position	Before an opinion is published it must be moderated and if it contains hate speech then the writer will not be able to post it.
__label__Support	I think that is a good way to go as it means posts can be checked before they are posted online so any posts that contain hate speech can be filtered out, whilst some may argue this goes against free speech and the right to free speech, I think when it comes to hate speech this is justified.
__label__Support	safety of readers
__label__Support	agree
__label__Support	Because it's the only thing that could actually work
__label__Position	Yes there must be a a strong policy for reviewal before publishing.
__label__Position	I think that things should be reviewed by a moderator, but it is a tough decision what is considered hate speech and what is someone's opinion.
__label__Attack	difficult to judge hate speech
__label__Position	Removing the comment section will not be effective since there will not be any interactions between readers.
__label__Support	Removing the comments section won't make much difference as people just migrate to different platforms to continue posting hate speech, the EU setup a code of conduct for countering illegal hate speech, https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/combatting-discrimination/racism-and-xenophobia/eu-code-conduct-countering-illegal-hate-speech-online_en, this has had an effect on hate speech online and is something that newspapers can be part of if they want to help stop hate speech being posted by users responding to online articles.
__label__Position	JosephM, Everyone has the right to freedom of speech, so cancelling the comment space prohibts one of such. I believe the comment should be removed if it contains hate speech.
__label__Position	Freedpn of speech doesnt mean you must promote hate speech on newspapers, it basically means you free to voice out your concerns in around society in a more respectfull manner.
__label__Support	freedom of speech
__label__Position	impossible to remove hate speech if it is unmoderated
__label__Position	It must me a government's responsibility to implement policies against hate speech.https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-to-combat-fake-news-and-disinformation/
__label__Attack	but what if users arent using their real information, how can the goverment implement it then?
__label__Position	hate speech can be fairly reduced by allowing other readers to either delete the inappropriate comment, another way would be to show the hate speech sender that their racist or homophobic comments can reach the real world and have real life concequences,they may lose jobs or a place in their university.
__label__Position	" Recommendation 5: Preventive Measures Social media companies and other internet intermediaries should adopt proactive policies that are consistent with international human rights standards and that are designed to prevent the dissemination of prohibited hate speech before it causes different forms of harm. They should harness reliable algorithms for natural-language processing and reliable sentiment analysis tools, whose decisions are subject to meaningful human review and challenge mechanisms, and employ their own internal trained content reviewers, with the aim of improving the identification of hate speech,curtailing the virality of prohibited harmful content, and/or allowing users to apply filters to block offensive content they do not wish to be exposed to. Social media companies and other internet intermediaries should also take steps to render their policies and rules visible and easily accessible to users, presented in a concise, transparent, and intelligible manner and written in clear and plain language, including examples of permissible and impermissible content. With the goal of discouraging users from resorting to hate speech, these proactive policies should be designed to foster understanding of the relevant policies and rules and employ culturally sensitive awareness-raising measures, which might include explaining how certain expressions or images might be perceived by affected individuals or groups." https://www.idi.org.il/media/13570/recommendations-for-reducing-online-hate-speech.pdf
__label__Position	I agree
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	not true
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Attack	It also promotes cyberbullying ,saying it is a free speech.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Support	I agree with this definitely. Let people comment but keep an eye on what people are doing by introducing moderators.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Attack	I believe that newspapers are supposed to spark a conversation, the conversation should be had directly in the comment section and should not be moved to different platforms
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	I do not think this is fair on the people who genuinely want to have a fair conversation on the subject.
__label__Position	Pro
__label__Position	There needs to be a level of moderation before comments are posted. Comments that are harmful, false or misleading shouldn't be allowed to be put up, but there should still be room for healthy debate.
__label__Support	I totally agree with this statement.
__label__Position	There should be serious repercussions against hate speech
__label__Position	There is a fine line between hate speech and honest criticism one should not be confused with the other and the person filtering such comments should be biased
__label__Support	Yes this is a sensible solution to this problem
__label__Position	It is easy to be hateful online when you are anonymous. Before being able to comment on newspaper websites, users should be required to sign up using traceable methods (eg. some form of identification). The comment section should regularly be monitored and any users who post hate speech should face serious consiquences
__label__Support	I agree but in reality, it is hard to carry out. It would require newspapers to work with law enforcement and there may be legal issues with the sharing of people's personal data. You also run the risk of this data being stolen or sold to groups or governments that should not be trusted with such data.
__label__Attack	While it looks fair to request readers to create accounts and enter their personal details before being able to comment, the reality is, data breaches are still very common. Expecting newspapers to keep readers data secure might not be realistic when such large and technologically advanced companies as Optus can become victims of hackers. Consequences of having personal customer data stolen can be severe. https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/oct/23/optus-data-breach-customers-yet-to-be-reimbursed-for-passport-replacements
__label__Position	I believe that comment sections should be allowed and should be monitored, but getting the manpower for that moderation is tricky
__label__Position	Making a user provide personal details to create an account and comment is both a good and risky idea. It is good as it means that people are less likely to comment hate as they are not anonymous and can be held accountable. It also helps prevent the creation of bot accounts which are often used to spread hate speech and false information. However there needs to be something in place to ensure this data isn't sold, used inappropriately and is kept secure and safe. This is a lot of work for newspapers so they may be unlikely to do this and just resort to turning off comments.
__label__Position	i feel incredibly conflicted about this, the simplest solution i feel is to make sure there are moderators who control the chat , although i imagine there would be resistance to this on behalf of the newspaper / platform as it would be costly .. if this cannot be done i feel it would be simply far simpler to remove the chat space entirely and allow the discussion to take place somewhere esle.
__label__Position	To have moderators in place.
__label__Position	To be able to comment because freedom of speech is only fair.
__label__Position	After reading a ;lot of peoples comments on this matter i still believe the best way to help this subject is to have moderators on the website in questions to keep hate speech off of the website.
__label__Position	A position that has surprised me on this platform is people thinking commenting should be turned off. This is not fair and if a newspaper website wants to have a posts free from hate speech they should moderate them.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__Support	Sometimes people do need to be censored, especially when it comes to hate speech because sometimes those words become actions and people get assaulted in real life. Words spoken online sometimes rally people together to take action (for example what happened in the United States when people stormed the Capitol because of fake news spreading online about the voting results being fraudulent https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/06/election-misinformation-helped-fuel-jan-6-capitol-attack-now-climate-misinformation-threatens-planet/ )

__label__Attack	Everyone has an opinion, and I agree that no one should be silenced. However I do not believe that the comment section of a newspaper article is where people should have the freedom to write hate

__label__Position	adjuster
__label__Position	Hate speech must be banned totally from the online publications.
__label__Support	Hate speech is bad and must not be tolarated
__label__Support	Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but opinions that are built around criticism of ones work do not benefit an ybody
__label__Support	agree. It is also well documented that it can be harmful. A modern legal test of the legitimacy of proposed restrictions on freedom of speech was stated in the opinion by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. in Schenk v. U.S. (1919): a restriction is legitimate only if the speech in question poses a “clear and present danger”—i.e., a risk or threat to safety or to other public interests that is serious and imminent.
__label__Position	I do agree that hate speech is indeed a big problem in this technological era. However,removing the ability for one to express themselves takes away the freedom of speech too. Maybe a good solution could be having the algorithm/AI filter those comments and not display them at all before they get to the public eye. People entering the platform can be informed of the rules against hate speech and be given a disclaimer that access to the page will be denied if any hate speech is dictated or an miscellaneous comments.
__label__Position	Monitoring of comment areas is not realistic
__label__Support	I would love to think that we could screen every comment written about every article but it is simply not realistic. Removing the platform that gives power to hate comments is the best solution. I understand that people want free speech, but i do not see this idea manifesting seamlessly
__label__Position	People should be allowed frredom of speech, but monitored or moderated somehow to looks for patterns of trolling behaviour
__label__Position	Hate speech is not free speech. It must be banned
__label__Support	I agree if there is a hidden purpose to it
__label__Position	I feel that we should have freedom of speecha and people should be allowed to make comments but they could be monitored and regulated to check for trouble causers and trolls
__label__Position	Filtering out comments and blocking out the hate speech before it's published can help reduce the hate speech
__label__Position	Regulations that require companies to promptly remove hate speech from their sites, such as the one recently introduced by Germany, will encourage newspapers to spend more resources to fight this issue. https://www.latrobe.edu.au/nest/can-combat-rise-online-hate-speech/
__label__Position	Perhaps having hate speech detectors that are automatically deleted once someone posts. Another option would be to give an option for people to report the comment with hate speech then the comment goes through an evaluation and will be deleted once confirmed as hate speech. This therefore, allows those without hateful comments to still have a platform to say their opinion.
__label__Position	I think the comments sections are important for discussion and sharing of opinions, whilst acknowledging the damage that can be caused by hate speech. Moderators, moderation by other commentators and harsher penalties for offenders could be a way of allowing free speech to be maintained without giving voice to those who wish to share hate speech.
__label__Position	Allow the speech, then allow other users to rebuke it.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Support	That's a very valid point
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	I am pretty sure some sort of hate speech itself is an infringement of ones human right and somehow defies what democracy stands for so it still does not lead to the necessary democracy either
__label__Attack	According to a recent survey by Morningconsult, 80% of people want to see all forms of hate speech removed. https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/social-media-firms-moderate-content/
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Attack	Comments should add to the article though and the commenters often go down a facebook-style rant about something not helpful or relevant, I don't think this is the right space for this
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Attack	I don't think blocking key words that in the majority could only be expressed in a hateful way would give them unilateral power. it is possible to do this under instagram posts and I dont think the majority of people would even notice
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Attack	This would require a special team to supervise the comment section at all times which might be costly.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	Moderation is a good idea
__label__Attack	Would probably be very hard to actually do anything about people posting hateful comments
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	Moderation of the comments who remove comments which go against an outlined code of conduct, warnings for accounts posting such comments
__label__Position	I think that someone should be assigned as a moderator who assesses comments before they are posted to ensure they don't contain any offensive information
__label__Attack	Moderation can be timely and expensive and then you wouldn't see comments in real time
__label__Support	This should prevent the majority of hate speech to be eliminated.
__label__Position	https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3394231.3397902
__label__Attack	-links showing other sites are a great way to show hateful infos in a coversation
__label__Position	I believe hate speech should be moderated and perhaps shadow-banned. That way users who post comments which are marked by the moderators as hate speech would never know they were banned and would not create new accounts or post more hateful comments.
__label__Position	Moderating is good and maybe informing the person why their message was moderated so that they know and do better next time
__label__Support	This sums up how detrimental hate speech could be
__label__Position	I think hate speech should be regulated rather than the comment space being removed. I believe that there is technology in place that could filter out any hate speech so that everyone may be able to express their opinion without offending anyone. I also believe that people can get their message across without discriminating against anyone
__label__Position	Whose responsibility do you think it is? Unfortunately hate speech will continue unless there is someone to control it
__label__Position	Hire moderators to monitor posts or use AI to try to police posts.
__label__Position	I think ways we can reduced hate speech include education on media ethics, as well as we should encourage conflict sensitive reporting and multicultural awareness campaigns. Also regulate the comments. This UNESCO article expands on these ideas: https://en.unesco.org/5-ways-to-counter-hate-speech
__label__Attack	I think using AI would not prove to be very effective. If this AI was to be self-supervised (without any moderators) I think it would quickly start flagging not-hateful comments as hate speech since it's very susceptible to user input - see what happened to Microsoft's Twitter bot Tay. After a couple of weeks, if I'm not mistaken, the AI started posting very hateful tweets about the holocaust and minorities.
__label__Attack	Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tay_(bot)#Second_release_and_shutdown
__label__Position	Removing the comment space from online newspapers is definitely not fair but I believe that it should be regulated by A-I. This way readers could share different opinions and thoughts abut the topic at hand without offending one another.
__label__Support	Hate speech causes more harm than good.
__label__Position	Education on media ethics, regulation of social media and multicultural campaigns can help curb hate speech. UNESCO cites this based on their research as found at this link: https://en.unesco.org/5-ways-to-counter-hate-speech
__label__Position	Education is the most effective way to curb hate speech by removing the underlying causes of hate speech in the first place. This is according to the United Nations strategy on prevention of hate speech. More can be found at this link: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/un-strategy-and-plan-of-action-on-hate-speech
__label__Position	By blocking the use of certain words that mean comments could be made but not hateful ones. you could also only read articles if you are logged in to an account and if you write nasty comments your account gets deleted.
__label__Position	I agree that a moderator would be too costly. I think the blocking of key words would be the best way forward. I also do think that if you were to read a paper article you would just discuss your views with your friends so I don't really see the need for a comments section.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	Could you elaborate?
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	I am for moderating as it does not necessarily silence the person but flags that they try to put their point across without using hate speech.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Support	i agree because some people may not be educated on certain topics, and therefore not realize that they are promoting hate speech
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Attack	I think sharing ideas is ultimately beneficial and having a space to do this can help form stronger opinions. Hearing different sides of an argument and different perspectives help ensure that we are considering many views and not hyper focused on one narrative that may not be the reality of other people.
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Support	Good!
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	allow people to say what they feel
__label__Attack	I don't think this is appropriate if it is harmful to others.
__label__Position	The solution to this problem is to NEVER allow opinions on news topics to be added (no comment section) we all have different views which is going to lead to problems occurring hence why no comment section no hate speech, its like a newspaper article
__label__Position	The rewspaper must always go thourough the content which reader are confotable with and try not to capture words which promote hate speech
__label__Position	This area must be monitored. This may include having an option to report someone's comment, so that it can be reviewed for insulting and derogatory behaviour.
__label__Support	agreed
__label__Position	Hate Speech can be very problematic as it may lead to some people even taking their lives. Filters, flags for harmful words or speech should be used to try and prevent hateful comments and such comments should be immediately removed
__label__Position	by never posting the hate speech words in the newspaper
__label__Position	By educating people that not everything written in newspapers is true, they should egnore some information
__label__Attack	I dont agree with this as sure it counters the hate speech but that makes me question the reliability of the news article
__label__Position	freedom of speech shoudln't include hate speech!
__label__Position	by allowing certain people not everyone to access newspaper websites, in that way hate speech would be reduced.
__label__Position	Those commenting with hate speech should be reported
__label__Position	Those commenting with hate speech should be reported
__label__Position	educate people on what hatesoeech s and the effects it has on people psycologically
__label__Position	Those commenting with negative comment should be blocked so that they cant be able to access the website again
__label__Position	Those commenting with negative comment should be blocked so that they cant be able to access the website again
__label__Position	Yes this is very true and very well thought out
__label__Position	Have set rules on what users can comment on regarding certain topics. If the user breaks those rules there should be consequences.
__label__Position	When you are found commenting with hate speech you should be arrested
__label__Position	Never use hate speech at all is not good for somebidy's heath
__label__Position	Those commenting with hate speech should be punished
__label__Position	te people that hate speech lead to people smoking drugs and it should not be allowed at all
__label__Position	Educate people not to use hate speech
__label__Position	There should set rules on what users can comment
__label__Attack	Removing comment speech will not allow people to express their feelings
__label__Position	In summary, there's no one rule. There have been comments about education but this is out of scope if we seek to address a current problem. There's a balance to be struck between moderation and free speech, clearly making users aware of what constitues hate speech/abuse and making consistent and graded responses to that, in the most efficient ways possible is the solution rather than banning comments altogether.
__label__Position	Comments should be monitored, or IP addresses banned if they contribute to hate speech
__label__Position	A mix of methods should be used - Automatic flagging/deletion of entries that include certain words, community striking, and human moderators.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Attack	We need to start somewhere as people will just carry on if nothing is done
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Attack	Your post contains the argument, "Newspapers should cancel comment space because it can create... fake news." I don't think this is particularly convincing. By that logic, newspapers and news websites themselves should be cancelled since they will periodically create "fake news" - sometimes not due to malice but rather by an honest mistake [or journalist incompetence/ignorance]. Ben Goldacre, for example, runs (ran?) a blog called, "Bad Science" and a recurring motif was journalists failing to accurately depict scientific insights. We could argue that their exagerrations and mistranslations could be construed as "fake news" but there's no malice involved. The journalists weren't trying to deceive anyone. The solution to getting closer to an approximation of truth is not to remove an entire avenue of communication, but rather to open up (regulated) communication in the hopes that the arguments that are most cogent rises above the rest - and that the logical wheat be separated from the illogical chaff. That is to say, I think we need a better system than just, "let's get rid of the comment section." It's a tricky problem, no doubt, and a perfect solution may not exist. But we should not let "perfect" get in the way of, "good enough." In a subsequent post, I detail ONE possible method that incorporates several solutions previously mentioned (and as I write this post, I thought of ways to improve it further. Not perfect, but perhaps good enough).
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	hate speech revolves around certain words or slurs so if those word can be banned or even not allowed and the comment does not show up on the actual site it will help curb hate speech
__label__Attack	I used to moderate a forum. The administrator set up various parameters for keyword triggers. There would be a lot of spurious reports due to poor spelling or grammar use - for example you would get a post flagged up for mentioning the word "hoe" however from the entire sentence it was clear they actually mistyped "home" - the system is not foolproof.
__label__Position	By banning certain words/phrases that may be viewed as rude/discriminatory/classified as hate speech. Removing the opportunity for comment completely would take away free speech and open discussion
__label__Support	This would help the content management team not have to answer every mail about comments.
__label__Attack	This may be challenging for newspaper websites with large audiences and therefore a great deal of traffic (which is a likely goal for most/all newspaper companies). The volume of new comments following a breaking story would likely be quite great and the task would very taxing for moderators. If the proportion of content that is hateful is quite high, you may be looking at quite a bit of burnout amongst the moderators who may quickly grow cynical, jaded, and emotionally exhausted from filtering out so much hatred and profanity.
__label__Support	Have to agree with this as this will allow people to freely express their views without the fear of hate speech
__label__Position	If eliminating readers comments is out of the question, then it must be that hate speech is recognized and removed before a comment is even published. People use the free speech argument but free speech isn't 100% guaranteed in cases of speech causing harm (e.g. Yelling fire in a crowded theatre). Hate speech causes harm.
__label__Position	Removing the comment section is will only prohibit the sharing of opinions and views and it may not necessarily eradicate hate speech.
__label__Position	While freedom of speech is a human right, it is imperative to be cognizant of the fact that each and every person has the right to have their rights respected. It is for this reason that readers comments cannot be removed. Everyone has the right to make a comment and we do not necessarily always have to agree, we always have to respect. A system can be put in place to remove any vulgar language.
__label__Attack	With every right comes responsibly so your right cannot impose on others
__label__Position	There should be some level of censoring to eliminate hate speech, but not to the extent where comments are totally disabled
__label__Support	True I totally agree. I think having certain policies in place before being able to comment will help. Look at this article here. on policies for internet companies https://www.americanprogress.org/article/curbing-hate-online-companies-now/
__label__Position	The only fair way is to remove comments with hate speech/slurs in them. It's either that or remove the comments entirely.
__label__Support	Yes, I agree 100% with this as the impacts of hate speech and cyberbullying can be detrimental to the person. https://www.youthranch.org/blog/social-media-dangers-and-the-effects-of-cyberbullying
__label__Support	The best way to deal with the issues of hate speech might be to ban the use of specific words or phrases that may amount to hate speech. Removing the comment section completely just allows the publication to share whatever information they want without the opportunity to be challenged by the public.
__label__Position	Having reflected and read some other's opinions, I wonder if not having comments on newspaper websites would just draw the extreme and hateful comments to other places. Maybe it is better on newspaper websites where it can be moderated!
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	You may argue that it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police their comment sections. Having said that, perhaps the relevant question you should be asking is whether it is in their best interests to do so. That is, even if it's not their moral obligation, it may STILL be in their financial and functional best interest to do so. The prevalence and salience of hate speech may signal to audiences that the newspaper tolerates (at best) and endorses (at worst) the hateful commentary appearing in their comment section. How do you think this would impact the bottom-line of the bottom line of said newspaper company? I would argue: Not well. And how do you think this would impact the ability of said newspaper to reach future audiences? I would argue: Not well. Individuals disgusted by the appearance of hate speech may be at an increased probability of avoiding said newspaper website in the future on moral grounds. Consider, for example, individuals who boycott Nestle for ethical reasons.
__label__Support	Agreed. No allowing the public to share their views only allows the publication to share information without being challenged and I don't think that's fair. There should at least be room for engagement and debate by the public.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Support	Yep. Rather implement ways in which one can refrain from hate speech
__label__Attack	People may take advantage of this.
__label__Support	Good for open mindedness.
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.

__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__Attack	It really depends on what type of personal data is being shared. I strongly believe in privacy because people can be crazy.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	It may limit potential information which could be spread in ways of educating people.
__label__Attack	I disagree with this because newspapers can lose readers due to poor interaction
__label__Support	It is nice to think we could reduce hate speech.
__label__Support	I agree, public debate is good.
__label__Support	Yep, this helps in eradicating hate words and people will notice that such is not allowed
__label__Attack	Some may feel undermined.
__label__Position	Censor out words
__label__Support	Yes I'm sure there is software that can do that.
__label__Position	The only way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites is letting the readers know that if they comment with negative words on the comment section they will be blocked
__label__Position	set rules that deal with hate speech.
__label__Position	2
__label__Position	2
__label__Support	Definitely true.
__label__Attack	Some people may turn bitter due to being told what they should and shouldn't do.
__label__Position	2
__label__Position	By allowing a section that briefly educates the viewers regarding the situation before they even get to the part of comment sections.
__label__Support	I agree. This could prevent uninformed comments which usually lead to hate speech.
__label__Attack	But people who engage in hate speech probably wouldn't take any notice.
__label__Position	Newspaper websites can have an option where other people could report the hate speech comment.
__label__Attack	I think the comment space should be monitored by the newspaper for a more standard approach, because a lot of people have subjective views on what hate speech could be.
__label__Support	Yes, a report button is a cost effective way to help ensure any hate speech is brought to the newspaper's attention.
__label__Support	Yes. This will prevent the probability of danger that hate speech usually causes.
__label__Support	There should be a warning to ban the account of someone who uses hate words in the comment section.
__label__Position	Ensure beforehand that readers understand what is going on and what is required of them. Discipline is key.
__label__Position	There could be a segment in the website that gives informed context to a subject to prevent uninformed comments and furthermore the newspaper should monitor the comments and censor any hate speech comments.
__label__Support	I believe it is fair for hate speech comments to be censored, because it could lead to violent public behavior. (read this: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech)

Blocking users who engage in hate speech. Setting out a clear of rules around conduct in comment sections. A report button so readers can report hate speech. Human moderators to ensure nothing slips through. Using these methods newspaers can allow the public to have their free speech while at the same time protecting people from hate speech online.
__label__Support	Hate speech cannot be tolerated.
__label__Support	I agree with moderators and hate speech/report buttons. Also Thumbs up and thumbs down are good and helps people understand the popularity of other peoples' ideas/comments.
__label__Position	There should be repercussions to extensive hate speech e.g a limited ban to the forum etc. Use moderators and ensure that users understand the consequences of hate speech commente
__label__Support	i agree repercussions should happen to the people who post hate comments
__label__Support	Moderators are the best way to monitor the content commented combined with a system that flags censored words
__label__Attack	This doesn't stop the issue of trolls creating a new account and commenting again. The internet makes it too easy for people to spread negative ideas.
__label__Position	they should monitor all comments and block people that post hate comments or censor certain hate words
__label__Position	there should be repercussions to posting hate comments and moderators or software that stop the hate comments so that everyone still gets freedom of speech
__label__Position	Should make it impossible for someone who has been blocked or flagged from posting hate speech to create another account to stop trolling.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	Free speech has a limit, and there is no reason why people should be allowed to post hate speech online.
__label__Attack	https://www.un.org/youthenvoy/2017/02/unesco-addresses-youth-radicalization-online-hate-speech-nice-conference/
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Attack	But then public opinion would be silenced.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Support	A hate speech detecting service as discussed in the following article could be the answer to this problem.https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-for-hate-speech-detection-a-large-scale-empirical-evaluation-92831ded6bb6
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Support	agree
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	hate speech is possible
__label__Support	totally agree
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	do u really know the meaning of hate speeches?
__label__Support	the same as my idea
__label__Position	Set the comment to filter those using hate speech and block the troll.
__label__Position	I think comments should be limited and all negative comments should be blocked
__label__Support	agree
__label__Position	I think by holding the people that use hateful speech accountable i.e., blocking them from accessing newspaper websites
__label__Attack	I think these people will then keep living in their own bubble and will never learn that their philosophy isn't normal.
__label__Support	agree
__label__Attack	but how do you reduce hate speech
__label__Position	We can hire a moderator to also monitor the comments because sometimes hate speech is not in English.
__label__Position	I think that fully blocking comments being allowed is detrimental to free speech, therefore comments should be allowed. However, there should be monitoring and banning of certain individuals if they are found to be continually hateful towards others.
__label__Support	agree
__label__Position	I think that moderation is the most effective way of preventing hate speech. Filtering comments would not work as it is difficult to find a algorithm for the context of a comment. Free speech is so important it should not be removed.
__label__Support	I agree. Freedom of speech must not be quashed. There should be much closer monitoring of comments and removal of hateful/abusive ones.
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	1st position: comments on newspaper articles should not be allowed
__label__Support	Comments should be allowed as they give readers a chance to express their feelings and mention the type of news that they enjoy reading
__label__Attack	There has to be a way that people can comment and respond especially if an article is not accurate. I feel that monitoring is a better answer to this problem, although also time consuming.
__label__Position	ADD A HATE SPEECH DETECTOR
__label__Attack	This is simplistic and would be very limited in its effectiveness.
__label__Position	There's without a doubt a very high chance of hate speech taking place online in the comment sections of a website. If you want to be fair you need to have a process in place. Decided what constitutes hate speech and then implement the necessary measure to reduce hate speech fairly. It becomes the website's responsibility. They need to find out the different methods and choose the best one for them.
__label__Position	There are some excellent suggestions in this study,which also raises the issue of freedom of speech also being freedom to hate. https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea
__label__Attack	sure what?
__label__Position	By closer monitoring of comments
__label__Position	This project takes the approach of counterspeech, whereby hateful comments are not removed, but instead responded to with alternative, police and non-aggressive comments. https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/counterspeech-better-way-tackling-online-hate
__label__Attack	It's a nice idea but requires a lot of investment to write the counterarguments. How do we ensure that time is worthwhile and the responses will even be effective?
__label__Position	There is no way to fully eliminate one or the other. The best option is moderation by well trained moderators.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.

__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	There's a phenomenon called "online disinhibition effect", that explain why people get more aggressive online that they would be in real life. https://www.kqed.org/education/532334/is-the-internet-making-you-meaner#:~:text=This%20phenomenon%20is%20known%20as,in%20face%20to%20face%20conversations.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Attack	most comment sections usually generate comments that turn into arguements if unmoderated
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	Yes, I think this is the right approach

__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Support	newspapers are meant to inform, not to be discussed. The comment section is not necessary.
__label__Attack	I dont agree with this, if hate speech is causing societal issues it should be talk about in the news
__label__Support	yes eliminate them and stop all comments that could offend people
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speech in the comments section, newspapers need to employ moderators on their platforms so that there can be someone watching and removing all types of hate speech in the comments section.
__label__Position	I think there should be moderators on articles that make the comments. less visible so offensive comments can have a warning before viewing
__label__Attack	I agree with this. The trick is how to select unbiased moderators. They have to go by a guideline
__label__Position	By writing article that promote inclusion and diversity for all races before publishing
__label__Position	The website must have words that are automatically marked as unacceptable. whenever those words are included in a comment, the website must privately warn the sender and not allow the comment to go through until the comment is rephrased correctly and politely.
__label__Attack	Even if it is moderated, who is to say that the moderator is unbiased and won't let some comments through even though they contain hate soeech
__label__Support	yes. the website can simply have words that are not accepted in the comments. this can minimize or eliminate hate speech altogether
__label__Support	I like this idea, it sounds very fair
__label__Support	Yes, another way to only limit hate speech is to remove anonymity. Therefore, certain sites can require those to sign-up with their bio and this is verified by moderators. Someone may think twice about being 'hateful' if there are repercussions.
__label__Position	maybe make the comment section questions and answers about the article so comments are stictley moderated
__label__Position	It is important to allow people to express their view to abide with freedom of speech. However, having the option to view these comment with a warning would allow people to ignore potential hate speech comments but still lets them read it if they want to.
__label__Position	yes it reduces polarisation but still takes away freedom of expression of the online reader
__label__Position	I believe that people are allowed to express their opinions , that is why we have freedom of speech. However with that right, we are not subjected to hate speech, there are so many ways of expressing yourself without using offensive or hateful words. Considering a newspaper is a public platform, I believe everyone should try to be respective at all times. The comment space must not be removed, it helps to get insights of readers and is very helpful. I think the website should be enhanced in a way that it detects offensive language and doesn't allow the reader to continue if they use such. Also, comments should be monitored before being posted to the public.
__label__Position	the comments with hate speech can be remove. and the commenter should be ban for a period of time
__label__Position	flag all the comments that contain vulgar words and warn the sender. the comment must be rephrased, failure to do so must result in the suspension of the sender from commenting
__label__Support	This is a great solution
__label__Position	online newspaper will definately attract a lot of people if there is comment section as some people prefer to go through comments first to get insight of the content.
__label__Position	I believe there is a really effective solution that can be used to prevent hate speech on comments rather than completely taking out the comment space as other people are suggesting. I believe newspaper companies are always looking for feedback from their readers as to the type of content being published and its relevancy and also just to get insights from readers on different topics. The comment space is the way of engagement and you cannot publish something and not want to hear what viewers/readers have to say about it.I believe moderation of comments or having a system that is able to detect hate speech might help.
__label__Position	I believe that reducing hate speech is a fair choice and it is not taking away freedom pf speech . Hate speech is abusive, threatening and expresses prejudice against a particular group , religion or race, we do not encourage that as a society and it is something that is not allowed in this society.
__label__Position	People can express them selves however they like but they must be mindful to their language.
__label__Attack	This will not stop hate speech
__label__Position	have an admin or moderator remove inappropriate comments.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Attack	free speech doesn't give you the right to harass other peop le
__label__Support	yes definately, removal of the section is an infringement rather find a way to navigate around sensitive or hate speech comments. maybe burn subscription of that particular individual
__label__Attack	I agree, I think it would be a form of censorship.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Support	Yep, fully agree with this
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	Common sense is not common
__label__Attack	not everyone has the same education or principles
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?

__label__Attack	Reader comments and opinions would be very beneficial towards newspapers as these comments could start meaningful conversations and introduce new perspective to the newspapers, and help readers be able to gain more understanding of topics by reading what other people think.
__label__Position	I agree with Andreas that moderation is key. I think contentious issues need to be deabted and discussed as they allow people to explore more information sources, consider their position and attitudes and make (hopefully wise) changes. We need to keep people posting on open forums rather than forcing them underground into more extreme corners oft he internet
__label__Position	Newspaper websites should use human or artificial intelligence-based moderators who can impartially identify hate speech and remove it from their platforms without removing or censoring genuine, constructive comments and perspectives. If AI is used, certain terms and phrases can be added to a database and comments containing them flagged for moderation to remove hate speech fairly.
__label__Attack	However it should be note that the AI should not be programmed with inherant biases of the programmer(s)
__label__Position	I think that education is the way to go about it, Humans must respect opposing views of others and tolerant society should be encouraged at all times instead of censorship
__label__Attack	removing comments section is never going to encourage tolerance it is
__label__Attack	it is censorship
__label__Support	In addition it would be helpful for there to be some form of data tracking to identify "repeat offender'who go around spreading hate speech consistently.
__label__Position	Instead of eliminating space for readers to comment, newspapers can introduce strict rules on what is and what is not acceptable and have readers agree to those rules before they comment. They should also state how disregard of those rules will be handled e.g. banned from the site. Should readers post hate speech, the newspapers then have every right to follow through with the next course of action, whether it is to remove the comment or ban the person. Free speech is still important as long as it doesn't cause harm to others.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a symptom of a toxic society and education to people to respect opposing views is the way to go
__label__Position	If we learned something from other platforms, it's impossible to completely manage the hate speech, and to reduce the hate speech without affecting free-speech we need to target the audience
__label__Attack	AI is a good solution but it can not detect hate speech that is in certain languages, currently AI can not translate all the languages spoken in the world.
__label__Position	I'm of the supporting view that the use of AI to filter out Hate speech could prove to be very useful
__label__Position	Comments on newspaper websites are beneficial as different opinions are valued, however these opinions should never be hateful. Comment sections should be somewhere people feel comfortable enough to have a conversation, without fearing being subject to hateful comments. To combat this, newspaper websites could inform people on what hate speech is and remove comments that are hateful. This is to create a good environment without people feeling they should be hateful. Hateful comments are neither necessary nor appreciated.
__label__Position	you can add an AI system in the website that will scan all comments instantly after they have been posted and it can remove any hate speech before it is seen by many people on the comment section, this method is used by some online communication platforms.
__label__Position	PatriziaB in an ideal world that would be great but it is a big ask. This article explains why it is important to be clear about what constitutes "hate speech" on a forum whilst allowing room for nuanced discussion.
__label__Position	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8585974/
__label__Position	Hate speech on an online platform would be harmful and should not be tolerated. People are affected by these harmful words and it does not create a good environment. This article explains why hate speech is so dangerous. https://impakter.com/hurt-feelings-real-danger-hate-speech/
__label__Position	Hate speech can be reduced on newspaper websites through monitoring from that platform. By coding derogatory words or terms so that they are automatically flagged this would be a fairly quick manner for websites to check that comments aren't spewing hateful rhetoric.
__label__Position	By using a tool to search for hate speech
__label__Position	Using a tool to search for hate speech would help to eliminate such comments and would not prevent readers from commenting on topics.
__label__Position	This is a good article in how to combat hate speech comments: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793

__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.

__label__Attack	People want to comment about what they've just read on the newspaper, they don't want to go to an external source to talk about it. Why would it be any better sending people elsewhere to do this? There must be a way to educate people as a way to prevent hate speech.
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words.

It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed

__label__Attack	I simply do not agree with your views Andrea. How can anyone living, or wanting to live in a democratic world want to actively curtail free speech in any form. I have done a little online research tonight and it seems my argument can be backed up by various articles and sources. Such as this one https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/
__label__Support	we need to understand that freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom of hatred
__label__Position	We can provide spaces for each person to write without them mingling and arguments starting over someones opinion.
__label__Support	Debate is important
__label__Position	I am unsure if there is a way to reduce hate speech. One persons 'hate speech' is anothers 'freedom of speech'. As a supposedly democratic nation, we need to be able to permit people from all walks of lives and experiences to air their own personal views, whether these are educated views or not.
__label__Attack	I understand your point but I think you're misinterpreting the point of this. Hate speech is damaging and should not be condoned in any form, regardless of freedom of speech. Freedom of speech includes allowing people to talk about their opinions, but not threatening people or expressing prejudice against certain groups.
__label__Position	I agree. One should not upload such comments on a public platform, constructive criticism can be allowed
__label__Position	And after we have learned to love each other, they wont be anytime for hatred speech
__label__Position	your opinion does not mean you should give hatred towards others as there is always a way to put your point politely
__label__Position	The voicing part, i think its gonna cause disaster
__label__Position	There are a few strategies for equitably lowering hate speech on newspaper websites without removing room for reader comments. One approach would be to have a group of moderators who are in charge of approving or denying comments prior to posting them.
__label__Position	The comment section must be cut off
__label__Attack	would prevent hate
__label__Support	not democratic
__label__Position	i think by just censoring specific words that are hateful/derogatory this could then automically screen out hateful comments that are abusive - i think it should be judged on what would be an offense to say in person. This could then use humans to read and monitor comment boards and then train AI to further do so
__label__Position	i think the platform should screen comments then if they are hateful it should flag and warn the writer to change the language / make them aware in a way that is inline with hate acts but at the same time without distorting free speech
__label__Position	I think that removing the comment space isn't the right solution. Change the website alrorithms to prevent and censore hate words would be the addequate thing to do.
__label__Position	Maybe comments space should be programed to stop hate words while people type
__label__Position	I agree with DamianC that we should start training AI to eliminate this kind of hate speach
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Attack	people will find a way to comment horrible things elsewhere in newspapers
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Attack	i feel that the education policy may not be the best idea as people may not listen/take in the advice as advised,meaning they could go back onto the website and write something similar due to just not caring at all
__label__Support	i suppose that for those who do listen and pay attention that this is a good idea as it allows for the idea of freedom of speech aslong as everyone knows what they are saying and how it can effect people
__label__Attack	i believe there is no cons at all
__label__Attack	The only problem is that facts and hate can sometimes be intertwined together and a system cannot always distinguish it easily
__label__Position	The difficulty with reducing hate speech, is that it is everywhere. It cannot feasibly be reduced with human power, but rather requires a computer system. The difficulty with an electronic system, is that it inherently requires money and financing, and therefore is incentivised to make money. When money is in the equation; thoughts, politics and ideas can be easily manipulated by those funding the system
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Attack	some mistook freedom of speech for spreading the hate speech. Some root causes of hate speech originate from child hood traumas and are deep, i do not think that we may be able to tackle those just for the comment section hate speech.
__label__Support	just a maybe if kids are taught to be nice online or in comments from a tender age.
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	How will we stop/prevent people from being aggressive with their opinion though particularly if they find a news story disagreeable?
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	Freedom of speech
__label__Attack	Need active moderation
__label__Support	I agree that education is important.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	This dos seem a little harsh, a little negativity will push you to greatness. I am for moderation.
__label__Position	I think there should be a comments section, truthfully reading through these do make me laugh. But there can be some cruel comments to. I guess you just need think skin for someone to be in newspapers
__label__Position	my opinion on this matter is that newspaper agencies must hire website monitors that will also be responsible for making sure that no hate speech is spread on the platforms
__label__Position	One way to reduce this could be to remove comments and block those who have been leaving these messages. I am not sure who easy this would be as you can create a new account in seconds probably. And if this is someone who is intent on causing controversy I am sure they will find a way around a block. Are you able to get something for platforms that can do this?
__label__Position	Hate speech should be flagged, hidden and the user should be given a strike. People should be able to still view those comments with a "trigger warning" disclaimer. After 3 strikes the user should be banned from commenting. But they should still be able to view the newspaper so that they don't miss an article that probably would have helped that particular person to change their behavior . More safe and reliable ways of verifying accounts should also be implemented.
__label__Position	I totally agree that hate speech should be limited as some readers do not take it lightly and may harm themselves after reading. I have heard stories about people ending their lives after their stories which often are embarassing are published, and the situation made worse by the comment section.
__label__Support	In many ways, the debates confronting courts, legislatures, and publics about how to reconcile the competing values of free expression and nondiscrimination have been around for a century or longer. Democracies have varied in their philosophical approaches to these questions, as rapidly changing communications technologies have raised technical challenges of monitoring and responding to incitement and dangerous disinformation. United States. Social media platforms have broad latitude [PDF], each establishing its own standards for content and methods of enforcement. Their broad discretion stems from the Communications Decency Act. The 1996 law exempts tech platforms from liability for actionable speech by their users. Magazines and television networks, for example, can be sued for publishing defamatory information they know to be false; social media platforms cannot be found similarly liable for content they host.
__label__Position	news media can look into AI technology to solve such problems.the machine will detect faul speeach and instantly hide or delete the comment ,then send a warning to the post writer
__label__Attack	The problem with AI is that it lacks morality, thus it can be exploited for other and selfish reasons.
__label__Position	The Council of Foreign Relations has noted that hate speech online does have real world implications, and is linked to increasing violence towards minorities. (https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons) What happens in online comment sections does impact the offline world and can put people in danger.
__label__Position	An issue is perhaps that different countries take different approaches to solving online problems. Some governments leave tech companies to solve these problems, while some governments take a more proactive role in eliminating hate speech, such as Japan. (https://reason.com/2022/07/09/new-japanese-law-makes-online-insults-a-jailable-offense/). However it is difficult because although the reduction of hate speech is something I am in favour of, I am also protective of privacy and as the article I linked notes, it is the governments in charge who define what hate speech is, which could potentially be a dangerous thing.
__label__Position	Hate speech in the comment section is a real problem which leads to real world consequences such as mass shootings as noted here in this article by the un https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech
__label__Support	Unmoderated online comment forums are magnets for noxious speech. For years they have carried people’s discontent out into the world, while the writers sit safely behind screens. It’s almost bittersweet to think back on the time we once blamed internet flaming on the online disinhibition of middle school pranksters. It is the many unhappy adults in the electorate who are posting the things they are really thinking in comment boxes. Nearly three-quarters of internet users – 73 percent – have witnessed online harassment. News website comment sections host antagonistic conversations between contributors. Nine out of 10 respondents of a Pew Research study said the online environment was more enabling of criticism. The squabbling can be overwhelming: As many as 34 percent of news commenters and 41 percent of news comment readers identified argumentative comments as the reason they avoid reading or joining the discourse. Multiple studies show online communities develop sophisticated norms that guide participants. Anger begets more anger. Unshackled digital vitriol is now volleyed back and forth online from all sides. Some commenters don’t even care if they are anonymous anymore. Researchers have found real-name comments on social media are actually nastier than unsigned commentary. Historically, American democracy always had some rudeness baked into it. For example, during the presidential election of 1800, incumbent President John Adams’ campaign proclaimed “murder, robbery, rape, adultery and incest will all be openly taught and practiced” if his opponent, Thomas Jefferson, won the presidency. Jefferson, meanwhile, described Adams as “a hideous hermaphroditical character,” with “neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman.” Civility in public discourse is often what people in power expect of their citizens. Demands for civility can be used by those with authority to deny power to those with none. People who feel marginalized or alienated use incivility and civil disobedience to fight the power. By causing offense and indignation, as we saw during Campaign 2016, outsiders gained massive attention for their cause. Yet “democracy only functions when its participants abide by certain conventions, certain codes of conduct and a respect for the process,” wrote cultural journalist Neal Gabler in an eloquent essay about how a hateful electorate threatens democracy. Gabler noted that the 2016 presidential campaign was referred to as the “hate election” because everyone professed to hate both candidates. It turned out to be the hate election, Gabler mused, “because of the hatefulness of the electorate.” He went on:https://theconversation.com/how-news-sites-online-comments-helped-build-our-hateful-electorate-70170
__label__Attack	Internet education is definitely needed
__label__Support	Internet education about etiquette and how to behave kindly to other people should be enforced.
__label__Support	Open debate can be healthy in terms of opening people's minds and changing their minds by providing new information. https://youtu.be/xD6_Ma5vutw
__label__Position	Showing people how victims of online hate speech have suffered might help to educate people on how not to conduct themselves.
__label__Position	I feel as though keywords and more stringent moderation can only help the situation
__label__Position	Freedom of speech allows others to express their opinions so we can have an open debate in the hopes of coming to some common agreement about polarising topics. https://youtu.be/WtftZPL-k7Y
__label__Position	You could possibly bar certain phrases or words but these need to be fairly selected and generally agreed by the community
__label__Position	Freedom of speech must be maintained but there is a level at which verbal abuse should be banned. Maybe some exclusions to personal abuse phrasese and comments should be employed
__label__Position	after much thought on this subject i have come to the conclusion that most of the mainline papers are biased in their view then all comments should be shown,,,but i still cant work out how the foul language can be supressed
__label__Position	hate speech is inevitable
__label__Support	are we listening?
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Attack	Newspapers in general typically should not be open for comment sections , it is the opinion of that set newspaper. Also its easy to throw the word "Algorithm" around with not knowing the technology behind it.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Support	That can come with an advantage since people would feel more scared of repercussions in case they do harm other people (basically, if not by empathy, then we use the law).
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Support	Good idea but an education policy would take time to be effective
__label__Support	Could be a good start. I ofen will reaserch/lokup infomation. AS
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Support	I agree with that. We shouldn't incentive hate speech.
__label__Support	If they give source to backup their views. That is good as you can verify it though the site could be bias.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	I agree as many news papers in our days don't have comment sections as it is expensive and time consuming
__label__Position	We need people to supply their personal details in order to limit hate speech
__label__Support	Agreed - it's technically simple to ensure that any website that allows public comments, can be linked to verified accounts. The government were thinking about doing this with adult sites - why not with sites that revel in hate speech.
__label__Attack	Even if someone provides their personal details many people are still not deterred from commenting hate speech proof of this is that in Facebook where most people have their personal information they still comment hate speech in the comments on posts
__label__Position	Maybe designing an algorithm which recognises the hate speech and removes it automatically. Basically, implementing AI in the app.
__label__Position	I believe some sort of regulation in media will always be necessary to decrease the damage hate speech might cause -- comments space included. We still need to get to the bottom of the issue, though.
__label__Attack	I'm afraid there will always people who will be offensive against others
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	People will need to get trained to identify hate speech.
__label__Support	Maybe this can engender a difference of awareness in the society as a whole.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Support	this is an efficient and cost-effective measure
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Attack	It is not possible for some people to ignore hate speech, and the effects can be extremely harmful - for example: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Support	I agree. In most cases people often react out of anger or disappointment, sometimes even without fully comprehending what is being said which I feel is the reason for some hate speech.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Support	i agree, its nice to see different opinions on different subject, different perspectives from community.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Attack	the cons at the moment of the comments with the public are that they are not checked for swearing, name calling etc
__label__Support	I agree

It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed

__label__Support	freedom of speech
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	Having a comments section can be ideal to engage in a healthy debate but will need to monitored very strictly to ensure there is no bullying or one sided views be taken against any individuals
__label__Attack	Moderators also have bias
__label__Support	Moderation to reduce hate speech, objectively will be beneficial
__label__Position	There need to be some kind of moderation, either before or after comments are published
__label__Attack	Moderator biases
__label__Position	Having certain words being banned or marked as inappropriate might help reduce hate speech. Systems that moderate what is being said and shared and the option to report hate speech might be helpful.
__label__Attack	reduces freedom of speech
__label__Position	I believe the comment section should be open to all to express their opinions.We need freedom of speech. Hate speech can be ignored. But it is important to show the view of all.
__label__Support	yes free speech should be protected
__label__Position	We need very close moderation as this in all likelihood is the best way to ensure hate speech does not spread, human interaction is key as algorithms do not do a very good job
__label__Position	one thing that should be used is there are some subjects that just attract hateful comments,some wise use of not allowing any comments to an article should be used ?
__label__Position	It is important to allow everybody to express their opinion, even if it is hate speech.If you see too much hate speech, it should make you reflect on why so many are so hateful toward the subject. It is a way to find out the real emotions of people, be it hate or good and to study the subject in this perspective
__label__Attack	Hate speech causes a lot of issues so it's nearly impossible to ignore. As much as we may have the right to freedom of speech, we also have the responsibility to engage responsibly.
__label__Position	I am reminded while discussing this of the way Daily Mail in UK handles the comments section. It just mentions on top of the comments page that theses comments are not moderated.So it allows everybody to express their opionion. This is how it should be done in my opinion
__label__Support	yes true i find no one really reads those comments anyways
__label__Position	sadly its the nature of people today and will be a very hard issue for the press to control.
__label__Position	Automated moderation can be useful but there will always be the need for human moderation (Goodman, 2013) https://netino.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/WAN-IFRA_Online_Commenting.pdf
__label__Position	Counting on peoples's good behavior does not work. (https://www.washingtonpost.com/discussions/2020/04/13/community-rules/)
__label__Position	Counting on peoples's good behavior does not work. (https://www.washingtonpost.com/discussions/2020/04/13/community-rules/)
__label__Attack	you cannot control people and there opinions.
__label__Support	its nice to live in a kind society
__label__Attack	no you cant control peoples behaviours but what you also cant control is peoples abilities to have an opinion. we all need to have a say, hence what twitter is full off .
__label__Position	block swearing, abusive, discrimatory words- freedom of speech without rasicism, name calling etc
__label__Attack	good idea but you nead the right person with a good moral compass on board,to give a level playing field for all.
__label__Attack	I think appointing moderators for this task is quite costly and it will be based on the subjective opinion of the moderator. Interference will prevent freedom of speech and will be a bit biased.
__label__Attack	Removing the comment section will not solve the problem but cause further frustration. It also takes away the opportunity for people to engage about issues and share ideas.
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Attack	hateful opinions are not opinions
__label__Support	True. I agree
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Attack	Someone has had to code that algorithm so it is already bias. Comments need a team of diverse moderators
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes

__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I completely agree with you. Opposing arguments are valid and people can have healthy debates without needing to resort to violence or hate messages. We need to enter arguments with sensibility
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	I agree slightly, it is good to see what others think unfiltered.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Support	I like to see comments with people who think like me
__label__Attack	I also think these should be monitored to a certain degree because hurtful comments can't be out there like they are currently
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree. Children should be taught in schools the value to expressing their opinions but also the difference in expressing and opinion and spreading hate.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Support	They shouldn't be removed completely because the allow for a open public forum for debate. They do however need to be regulated and moderated to try to reduce hate speech. Other users should have the ability to down vote comments report them for harmful opinions. These can then be assessed by professionals
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	it says it could be removed, but doesn't guarantee always
__label__Support	absolutely agree with this and think that this could lead to people have openminded discussions and would promote a different way of thinking which is okay
__label__Support	this asks internet users to give up their right to anonymity
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	The media is based on the idea that they have the freedom to write or speak about any topic they wish. To take that same idea away from other people to respond and contribute freely to what is being said would be the end of a diverse and opinionated society. I don't think that silencing the reader would stop them in engaging and maybe even caring.
__label__Position	we should keep comment sections on newspaper websites but we should have moderators to filter out any hate speech
__label__Attack	I like it but i worry it would just be ignored. Just removing a comment isn't much of a deterrent
__label__Position	We're forgetting that on some platforms, the person who made a post on social media can chose to disable the comment section. this could be a solution for newspaper websites if their comments are attacked by trolls.
__label__Support	I really think this could work as technology has come so far and it's out there and available to be used.
__label__Attack	This can be one of the ways a website can detect hate speech but should not be the only way. There should also be real people moderators and an ability for other readers to flag any comments that raise a concern.
__label__Support	A list of keywords around can be gather and blacklisted on comment sections.
__label__Attack	I think with people reading less newspapers both hard copy and online, Print subscription circulations have fallen by 7% over the past two years, from 125 million overall to 116 million, while single-copy sales are down 11%, from 3.2 million in the first half of 2019 to 2.8 million in the first half of this year.17 Dec 2021, the papers are not going to give the time and effort to monitor the comments sections when there's nothing in it for them.
__label__Position	The comments section may be removed on especially conflicting topics/conversations.
__label__Position	I believe that comment space does enhance social participation and should not be completely removed. I do think that it should be regulated by moderators following a clear set of standards. It might also help to make people more accountable for what they have written, by having to supply some personal details before commenting.
__label__Position	the best way is for companies to filter hate speech and remove it as long as the criteria for hate speech comes from an independent organisation. If companies themselves govern what is hate speech then we would become subject to there rules which you would lose the point of freedom of speech. Also there should be more support in the community for people who are being targeted in hate speech attacks.
__label__Support	yes, hate speech criteria should be overlooked and set by a credible outside source.
__label__Position	it should be regulated by setting standards
__label__Position	Hate speech can be controlled by blacklisting keywords on the search engine of a particular blog post/newspapers which will delete any comments that may contain any of the blacklisted keywords.
__label__Attack	I think this should be done by a real person, as using a computer, some hateful words can be disguised and still get through
__label__Position	it should be proof read and all hate speech should be completely eliminated but people are still entitled to give their opinion on topics.
__label__Position	Ultimately the comments are needed to gather feedback in certain situations, removing the comments section wouldn't help us eliminate hate speech because where information needs to be gathered, no blacklist will help.
__label__Position	I agree! People need their opinions heard
__label__Position	I don't agree, people are entitled to have their voices heard
__label__Position	An independant moderator
__label__Position	We do not need to as it is free speech
__label__Support	I really like this idea, as hateful material could be hidden quickly.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	This would be a lazy attempt to reduce hate speech as it doesn't allow for people to make genuine, thoughtful expressions of opinion that is useful for others to read.
__label__Attack	I think people still have the right to comment on an article and give their opinion. It would be wrong to not permit this.
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Attack	Aggression is a subjective aspect. Someone may be expressing themselves passionately, but is seen as aggressive. Cultural differences and misinterpretation of words and intent can also influence opinion of a comment's 'aggression'.
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions

__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Support	Shows an active moderation panel.
__label__Attack	Free speech can be restricted.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	Tracking details could become intrusive.
__label__Support	Would support accountability instead of a comment submitter operating in the mystery and shroud of being anonymous.
__label__Support	Persons would consider their thoughts more carefully.
__label__Support	If required, details can be handed to the authorities if there is a legal breach.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Support	There would potentially be reduction of hate speeches, but similarly there would be removal of positive speeches/opinions.
__label__Attack	Regardless of training, unconscious and conscious biases will be introduced regardless as the moderators are human.
__label__Position	by not allowing certain words to be used in the comments space
__label__Attack	who decides which words are to be blocked and which are not, some people may find certain words offence while others may not.
__label__Support	that could also be helpful
__label__Position	what some people find offensive others don't - how to we agree on what is and what isnt
__label__Position	By ticking a box to agree not to be abusive or hateful before being allowed to comment
__label__Attack	Is this a legally binding contract?
__label__Attack	I agree with this comment
__label__Attack	Slow process. Subject to flaws if misinterpreted by moderators/other commenters.
__label__Position	they need to as often it is minorities which are affected
__label__Position	Freedom of speech still has its limits!!
__label__Support	Great
__label__Support	yes, I feel that if freedom of speech incites violence against a person or a specific race then it should not be permitted.
__label__Attack	A perceived reputable source, but can have political leanings and opinions.
__label__Position	We need to stand together as readers against hate speech.freedom of speech is allowed to give your thoughts and opinion about a certain topic but that doesn't give a person full right for a person to be disrespectful.freedom of speech should build and not to destroy a person.
__label__Position	This is something that I think is impossible to do. One can never ever be sure of people s intensions. I don't believe newspaper websites should even have space for readers comments , there are other platforms where readers can express themselves
__label__Support	comments on every platform can become a breeding ground for hate. It becomes a place for people to vent and voice their hateful comments, it can also lead to bullying and other negative aspects of online life. Comments should be banned unless heavily moderated.
__label__Position	it if not write to silence people about thing written for then. it is like forcing one to believe your story without verifying it
__label__Position	space for comments does not belong on newspaper websites
__label__Position	After going through all the other comments ,my opinion on the topic has not changed. Newspaper Websites are where people should get the news from ONLY, not write their opinions. They can go express their opinion else where about what they have read , not on the website.
__label__Position	Making clearer what behaviour the law prohibits and increasing the consequences for breaking the law Replace the existing criminal provision with a new criminal offence in the Crimes Act that is clearer and more effective What is the current law? As described earlier in this document (on page 12), there is a crime of intentionally “inciting racial disharmony” in Aotearoa in section 131 of the Human Rights Act. What is the problem with the current law? This is a complicated provision and is difficult to understand. It uses four terms, “hostility”, “ill￾will”, “contempt”, and “ridicule” which have broad meanings and could also potentially overlap. It also uses the word “excite” in a way that is not often used in day-to-day language. The Royal Commission noted that, unlike the civil provision, it does not cover electronic communications. What will this proposal do? This proposal would create a new criminal provision in the Crimes Act that is clearer and easier to understand than section 131 of the Human Rights Act. Under this proposal, the terms “hostility”, “ill-will”, “contempt” and “ridicule” would be replaced by “hatred”. This wording was suggested by the Royal Commission, which acknowledged that the change would narrow the meaning of the words, when compared to the current offence.
__label__Support	I really liked the identity verification requirement
__label__Position	Moderation of deliberately antagonists, false or posts inciting hate should be conducted. Training on bias, education on the subject would help
__label__Position	banning repeat offenders and identification of trolls should be tightly managed.
__label__Position	There is a strong regulatory element needed to crack down on platforms by newpapers for encouraging this. The Code of Practise (https://www.ipso.co.uk/editors-code-of-practice/) for Editors should include expectations that comments can be made freely but will be managed an hate crimes reported.
__label__Position	I really like this. It might be a costly exercise for newspapers and media companies to employ moderators, but the reduction in comments sections without oversight would be no bad thing.
__label__Position	I have found that as well as reading the articles from newspapers, I have also been paying keen attention to the comments section of the article. Either on the newspaper site or on social media. I find that while the opinions of the article presens the views and research of the author, the comments offer an alternative viewpoint and opinions. A chance to see if the article hit the right note, and an opportunity to understand positives and negatives of a topic raised.
__label__Attack	Persons can become very insensitive and offensive in the opinions given, especially in the unmoderated comments forums.
__label__Support	A rounded view of a topic. Ensure that their is a balanced opinion around newspapers. And also offers a check and balance--the public opinion is heard and known around issue raised.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Support	New ideas and thoughts emerge from the comments. New opinions.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons
__label__Support	hate speech online only leads to hate speech in real life. online is where much of the real world violence is incited and begins.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Support	we need unbiased media and to hold them accountable
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Attack	This is a great idea as people can openly speak their opinions without worry of being attacked.
__label__Support	I would imagine that it would be difficult to filter out all of the hate speech
__label__Attack	No hate speech
__label__Support	No contribution to the general debate.
__label__Position	conduct more research on it
__label__Support	yes! This is exactly what i said
__label__Position	I think using a platform which blocks out certain words, kind of like a filter would help. So if someone made a post with a certain word in, that post would not be made public, instead the comment would be flagged and go to a admin, who can read the comment and then decide if the 'bot' which flagged it was correct or not, and then deciding if to allow the post to be made or not
__label__Support	I agree this would helpfilter some of the hate speech
__label__Attack	This might overcome some problems, but would be hard to remove subtle or 'disguised' hate speech, if only working on word triggers.
__label__Position	There will always be readers who make appalling comments that are unsubstantiated and incite hate
__label__Position	I believe that comments should be regulated and any negative comments should simply be removed. Eliminating the chance to discuss topics freely isn ́t the solution and shouldn ́t be considered.
__label__Position	Some people will always use hate speech and hide behind their computer, There needs to be some sort of filter added to flag such comments and people and a ban put on the user
__label__Support	I agree in principle to the idea of moderators, but in practice this can be a pretty blunt tool and quite labour intensive.
__label__Attack	It is the best solution
__label__Support	Must include specialist training for moderators as well.
__label__Support	I agree, any news that is shaared on a website will have the possibility to be shared on twittter and the hate speech could continue there
__label__Attack	Newspapers don't have an interest in this
__label__Attack	without online verified profiles being mandatory i think this could be difficult to put into practise
__label__Attack	It could lead to technical mistakes barring genuine contribution
__label__Attack	could take a while
__label__Position	I dont agree that hate speech should be seen as free speech. We should be able to critisise and share resources and fact check, express options of disappointment and dislike but i dont think there should be such a large space online for people to fill it with hate, awful coments about other groups of people or individuals.
__label__Position	I believe that the comments section should allow coments from everyone, however newspapers should be duty bound to provide in person moderation for the comments section to monitor for hate speech. I am unsure if there is an AI sensitive enough to police hate speech around difficut issues yet so as of now I think any moderation would have to be carried out by a person or be counity lead.
__label__Position	I think another option for reducing hate speech from newspapers would be to remove the anonymity from comment sections and make everyone have to post under their own name. I think anonymity gives peols the protection to say things that they owuln not necessarily be able to say if everyone knew who they were a chance that they could be held accountable for their hat speech.
__label__Position	Medium posted an interstng debate on the pros ad cons of censoring hate speech within the news. https://medium.com/the-lonestar/censoring-hate-speech-pros-and-cons-3f54b572b3f0 this made a strong arguemnt for the censorship of hate speech withint he media.

__label__Position	Using moderation. Unbiased moderation only.
__label__Position	One thing that surprised me is that certain people where not really answering the question at hand and they were addressing something different which caused them to miss the point. The priority should be to make user feel safe at all times and make sure that they ca make clear and sound comments without getting hate.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks.

__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Attack	my thoughts exactly..Hate speech can also be helpful in improving the news papers.
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	I also agree with this. This solution is a middle ground between two extremes.
__label__Attack	I believe moderation should occur instead of total removal to allow people. to express their views
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	I think this solution can be very intrusive. Especially in a times where our personal data is being collected as a commodity.
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	I am for a monitored comment section. Eliminating it completely might compel people to find other ways to leave hate speech comments.
__label__Support	I agree with this as the comment section will be filled with hate speech that could be upsetting for some
__label__Support	I agree as there is a lot of content online that is false or relies on small data that is not reliable. For instance, see this link on fact checking content https://www.ntu.ac.uk/about-us/news/news-articles/2021/12/fake-news-and-fact-checking-study-examines-social-media-use-during-the-pandemic
__label__Position	I believe that a moderated comments section is the way forward. I don't believe that eliminating it completely will solve hate rhetoric online as people will move to other forums/platforms to do this.
__label__Position	We can have a system where every comment has to be checked and vetted for hate speech and if it infringes on any of the platform's rules and regulations then the comment is automatically removed.
__label__Support	This is probably the optimal solution, but it also requires a lot of work force and might be quite expensive, too.
__label__Position	A study by the Israel democracy Institute (https://www.idi.org.il/media/13570/recommendations-for-reducing-online-hate-speech.pdf) suggests that social media companies should be required to assist with such matter as they are a large platform for hate speech. Working with mainstream media (newspapers) may assist with globally reducing the hate rhetoric
__label__Position	While hate speech can be harmful , it can also be helpful. If we can read through the speeches we can be able to determine what the problem is from the comments and improve.We can also create work limit on comments.
__label__Attack	I do not believe that the people writing hate comments on newspaper posts would spend time doing this, therefore, i feel like it would be a bad approach
__label__Position	Hate speech is an attack, a threat, or prehudice speech.
__label__Position	If you see an opportunity to add value to the person who left the comment, or perhaps explain your intention in a way that they can understand it better, go ahead and respond with love, patience, and in a way that adds value to the conversation
__label__Position	And remember, before you respond you’re determining whether someone is posting a hateful comment just for the sake of being a hater, and someone who wants to be heard and has helpful feedback... but could work on their delivery.
__label__Attack	I dont think you can use all means necessary to eradate hate speech. You can only control how you react to it
__label__Position	Have a seperate space for readers to contribe views and opinions. Not linked to the article. This would reduce hate speech
__label__Position	https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/combat-online-hate-speech/#:~:text=Here%E2%80%99s%20how%20you%20can%20help%20combat%20hate%20speech,hate%20about%20the%20worst%20instances%20you%20see.%20
__label__Position	you cannot eliminate it. dont try. freedom of speech is importante and we must appreciae others have different view
__label__Attack	Obviously there will be bias from the moderators as well, so this too will need to be kept in mind.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	I agree that we should probable rather try to find the root cause of such comments. Based on this article by Guardian (https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/12/the-dark-side-of-guardian-comments) most of the hateful comments are directed towards female journalists.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Attack	Hate speech is not at all the same as valid criticism. And if freedon of speech is resulting in hate speech then I think it should indeed be policed and silenced
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Support	Agree this is sensible
__label__Support	i agree with this. although i believe that freedom of speech and hate speech do not have a visible line. thus someone may be hiding behind the guise of freedom of speech but spewing hate rhetoric.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	This is true
__label__Attack	Whilst I think that removing comments wouldn't fix hate speech, surely it would definitely diminish it and isn't that better than no solution at all?
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Attack	But won't people find other ways of creating fake news and hate speech? I mean they can still copy that link and post it on social media giving their opinions
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Position	By monitoring the comment section and holding people liable for their hateful speech.
__label__Position	By monitoring the comment section and holding people liable for their hateful speech.
__label__Position	By monitoring the comment section and holding people liable for their hateful speech.
__label__Position	By monitoring the comment section and holding people liable for their hateful speech.
__label__Position	i do not think hate speech can be eliminated completely however i believe with perhaps moderators, it may help to be a less negative space.
__label__Position	People who share hate speech can have their comments removed and their accounts banned from the platforms
__label__Position	By having an administrator who is able to monitor any comment posted, and removing hateful speech and giving warning to hateful viewers
__label__Attack	By making rules it means they might lose a some of their viewers because most people are disrespectful and hate discipline
__label__Position	I believe a more thorough discussion on what the purpose behind removing those comments is warranted. Is it to try and reduce hate? Is it to protect readers? to not give negativity a breeding ground? If it is primarily to protect readers from hate speech, then any counterargument involving hate speech slipping through is void as it is about reducing frequency as much as possible.
__label__Position	I think both can work. The general public can report comments that are harmful especially on online platfor ms so that they can be removed and the accounts shadowbanned
__label__Position	Hate speech in the internet has to be eliminated
__label__Position	Some people are really stuck in their own beliefs and views that education will not change their perspective. This however should not deter us from having necessary discourse on important societal issues because actual people die in some cases because of hate speech
__label__Position	In as much as there comment section shouldn't be eliminated completely, maybe evaluating and deleting comments that have hate speech.
__label__Position	People are allowed to have different views on certain topics and to engage with others on newspaper websites but this will be prevented by hate speech which may make other readers to stop reading
__label__Support	I think everyone can agree that we don't need to hear the opinions of people who spread hate. I doubt people would stop reading newspapers, personally i would rather not have a platform to share my opinions if it means other hateful comments can't be shared
__label__Position	We can remove it fairly by making rules and monitoring the comment section.
__label__Attack	We wont get honest feedback from the views
__label__Support	And we will get to keep our respectful viewers who knows that you still have disagreement without insulting others
__label__Position	Hate speech should not be entertained, if newspaper website fail to moderate their readers comment section, it is best to close the comment sections
__label__Position	by having professional unbiased moderators
__label__Position	i agree that people have the right to express their own ideas but you have to be considerate otherwise it can easily be interpreted as hate if your not careful with wordings.
__label__Attack	I don't agree as I don't think it's that easy to mix up hate speech and an opinion, if you genuinley don't have any hateful intentions. For example, not liking an establishments choices is much different from major hate/offensive speech
__label__Position	Younger people are susceptible to propaganda by the establishment "elites", they will be easy targets of manipulation by saying that ALL opposing views are "hate speech".
__label__Attack	anyone writing things against the prevailing narrative will be shut down. George Orwell wrote this would happen and women would be the ones easily taken in and become enforcers.
__label__Support	people who support "hate speech" laws are the same ones who would have supported the Nazis and Soviet Union "pravada" (truth).
__label__Position	some people "troll" by writing inflammatory remarks, but it is fundamental to a free society to have free discussion. Any attempts at calling something "hate speech" will be only about stopping anything that goes against the narratives of the rich establishment.
__label__Support	I agree that the establishment will have too much power, and not be fairly represented if fair negative opinions are seen as hate speech
__label__Support	I like the idea of 'repeat offenders' being noticed if you will. It means people can't abuse the system as easily
__label__Support	I absolutely agree. The first sentence sums it perfectly!
__label__Position	This article below focuses on the negative views of the comment section. I like the quote from Dr Philips, as she explains that more discussion is required, not less, and thus an onsite intervention is required to deal with hate speech as opposed to the removal of the comment section. https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation
__label__Support	great comment, thanks for adding verified sources which strengthens these ideas
__label__Position	Seems like counter-speech is also a good technique to integrate into a moderating system. I still believe the hate comments themselves should not be made public, but could maybe been shown as a blocked comment due to hate speech, with the counter-speech available to view for anyone, or it could simply be sent to the poster after removing their comment in order to give them a chance to reflect. https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=1877a1a6-35c9-4355-9270-bba5a521639f
__label__Position	An article proving AI can be helpful, but can struggle to interpret or detect certain things, suggesting manual reviewing is still very important. https://www.latrobe.edu.au/nest/can-combat-rise-online-hate-speech/ On another note, I also think anonymity plays a huge role in what people allow themselves to post online and think that certain platforms should consider only allowing people to comment under their own identity rather than online handles and such.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	To reduce hateful speech on newspaper website, I think every newspaper must have their own admin, who monitors the comment posted and remove hateful speech and if an indvidual continue they must get blocked.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	I quote "Hate speech is defined as bias-motivated, hostile, malicious speech aimed at a person or a group of people because of some of their actual or perceived innate characteristics." (https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea) If a comment is hate speech, it is mutually exclusive to being valid criticism.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Attack	Hate speech can spread rapidly, and destroy lives. It is offensive, hurtful and can ruin people. I think this is a very bad opinion to take.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Support	This is true
__label__Support	I agree, there is a certain level in which the elimination of hate speech overrules the need for comments
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Attack	well said.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Attack	Hates speech does not automatically equate to freedom of speech. In fact, often times it is a violation of many human rights. In that case it should be removes so as to protect the people that would otherwise be harmed by those hateful comments. Here is an article on the relationship between hate speech and freedom of expression. https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I agree, everyone has freedom of speech but no should abuse it and use it using hate speech. Everybody should respect everyone's idea/opinion.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	Implementing a software that detects comments including hate speech, like the ones on social networks. Also including a report button for poeple to report hate speech comments
__label__Attack	People may not freely divulge what they actually think if they know they can be tracked down and "re-educated"!
__label__Support	The problem with this is that the moderator themselves often have an agenda.
__label__Support	I think so too. But would that not further allow for subjectivity to cloud ones judgement(the moderator)? I propose there be a guideline set as to what qualifies for hate speech, both by law and by the standards of the newspaper. That guideline should be posted in the newspaper or on the social media platforms and that will ensure that there is no grey area on the matter.
__label__Position	I think we should have vigorous ID checks when signing up and being able to comment. People will then be accountable for their actions
__label__Position	The key to reducing hate speech without completely eliminating the comment section in news papers is to educate the public on what may qualify as hate specch and therefore ban such in the comment. Great care should also be taken in this matter so as to preserve freedom of speech and expression but also adhering to the anti hate speech guidelines that have been set.
__label__Attack	Disinformation is rampant: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/magazine/free-speech.html
__label__Position	I'm not sure if it will work but they can put a sign on the website that says no to hate comments allowed. Or a report button can also help then administrator can review the reported comments
__label__Position	having a team that moderates the comments beforehand is a good idea.do not post comments that have hate speech.
__label__Attack	A moderating team might work but it could also be hard to revise every comment, specially is the newspaper is popular
__label__Attack	time consuming
__label__Position	https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation
__label__Attack	I think if the hateful users find other places to share their opinions, they might find similar minded people and create a hateful community that might do more harm than just the individuals
__label__Attack	Opinions can damaging and should not always be shared
__label__Position	comment sections are necessary so we can see different opinions on one topic
__label__Position	Hate speech, although in many cases is specifically excluded from freedom of speech, is often difficult to regulate. In such cases then subjectivity or bias can be used and that could be seen as a violation of the right to freedom of expression. This makes the whole situation a grey area and it is only by further encouraging dialogue and conversation that can we get closer to a definitive answer on this. Here is an article that addresses the trouble with regulating hate speech. https://www.thefire.org/is-hate-speech-protected-by-the-first-amendment/

__label__Position	I think a good use of an algorithm which flags for hate speech or racist language which then flags to a human. This would mean that potentially offensive posts would not be posted until validated by a human
__label__Position	People forget that comments do not just go into a vast vacum online, they can have real damaging effects. Here is an article from 2014 which beautifully summarises by saying that assertions that they are just comments gives no humanity to victims - https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation
__label__Position	It would require a very robust means of distinguishing between what exactly can be classified as hate speech. If somebody who does not approve of hate speech quotes what somebody else says that is an hate speech. would the person quoting the hate speech be regarded as approving the hate speech?
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	Disagree, there are ways to reduce hate speech, but they need to be implemented correctly.
__label__Attack	I disagree, try to read everyone's idea. Some are feasible and doable
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	But to what extent should free speech be allowed? Should we as a society allow people that say hateful things against a particular ethnic group, race or gender all in the concept of 'its free speech, you can say whatever' I think that people are able to practice their rights but as soon as it starts becoming oppressive or infringing on another person's right, that is where we should start drawing a line.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Attack	I like the idea, however, most people don't have the time to go to other website to engage in conversation. This, if anything, will likely to reduce the amount of constructive conversation rather than increasing
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	banning certain words would absolutely work.
__label__Position	banning words is an useful idea but in addition, moderators are key for public newspapers websites. they are able to moderate what goes on and get rid of hate speech whilst still providing a platform for those that have honest but respectful opinions.
__label__Position	there should be rules that have to be followed and if someone does not follow the rules then their comment should not be able to get posted.
__label__Position	Remove text box, but put reactions instead.
__label__Position	completely agree with this allison. However, I would feel safer knowing comments are being moderated and hate speech is being taken serious even if this means a few critical comments which don't completely fit the hate speech category are taken down. I would silence a few but i trust moderators would choose to only get rid of those comments that are genuinely harmful
__label__Attack	Most newspapers are inherently biased so you can't really trust them to handle hate speech
__label__Position	Is space for readers comment really that necessary? Nowadays, with all other social medias available, the conversation can happen on platform made for dialogue. But as practice shows, those "conversations" are often very polarized and everyone is kind of screaming in a void.
__label__Attack	i think people do need to vent,this is a safe way to do so
__label__Position	The key way to do it would be with very in-depth moderation which is non-biased and respects criticisms but its aware when a comment is taken too far and viewed as hate speech. the comment section should not be eliminated but mainly moderated and supervised
__label__Support	This would be a great idea, however, it's also important to take into notice that everyone has their own biased; so one statement could be hate speech to one but not the other
__label__Attack	Awareness campaigns would not suffice. Real methods could be implemented to reduce (white supremacist) hate speech: "White supremacist speech is readily detectable, Hemphill says, detailing the ways it is distinguishable from commonplace speech in social media, including: Frequently referencing racial and ethnic groups using plural noun forms (whites, etc.) Appending “white” to otherwise unmarked terms (e.g., power) Using less profanity than is common in social media to elude detection based on “offensive” language Being congruent on both extremist and mainstream platforms Keeping complaints and messaging consistent from year to year" https://news.umich.edu/hate-speech-in-social-media-how-platforms-can-do-better/
__label__Position	I am not sure that newspaper websites need a comment section. The principle of commenting on the Internet is often one of each person giving their opinion without caring for the opinions of other. There could be the same problems as seen on social media and how it polarizes or amplifies opinions out of proportions, loosing the idea of dialogue and just creating echo chambers. https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1804840115
__label__Position	From what I can understand, this problem can be solved by setting very clear rules of what is allowed and what isn't. To reduce hate speech we should set clear rules that prohibit comments related to racism, xenophobic, homophic, transphobic, sexist... behaviour as well as comments aimed at individuals which may comment on their appearance, personality, etc. Criticism which is constructive should be allowed as this is just someone's opinion which deserves to be heard
__label__Position	if a comment is going to hurt someone then it should not be published
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Attack	I don't agree. There are too many people who shouldn't have access to the Internet. They hide behind their PC screens and writes a lot of things they would never dare to say in reality. They believe they can say everything that comes to their minds when they can hide behind a PC screen, and that lowers the quality in the comments section. And there are laws against racism and other topics than they can use as triggers.
__label__Attack	If a newspaper does not do anything, it might facilitate hate speech and help it reach to millions of people by simply hosting it on their website. Therefore there is a responsibility.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Support	Using an algorithm to automatically filter out posts that contain obviously offensive and derogatory words or phrases would be a good way of persevering free speech and spirited debate.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Attack	It is important to actually define what hate speech is before an agreed education policy can be enacted.
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Support	I agree. The BBC has previously been reprimanded for only having one side of the climate change debate speak (denier vs scientist). The public should receive multiple points of view in a way that is balanced and evidence-based.
__label__Support	i agree with this, for there to be a clear definition before you post, not terms or rules in small writing
__label__Position	Issues around hate speech bring into clear relief the emergence of private spaces for expression that serve a public function, this may lead to violence or non-radical behaviors for the public at large. The only possible way of reduction is for writers to not write or give out any opinions of hate speech. This will ensure that readers are comfortable.
__label__Attack	The problem is hate speech needs to be clearly defined. There will be people that use "hate speech" as a means of having opinions they don't like removed.
__label__Attack	you can't exclude people from their own community
__label__Position	It can certainly be argued that hate speech is nothing new https://blog.ongig.com/diversity-and-inclusion/human-rights-policy-hate-speech-policy/
__label__Position	a post here was removed quickly for hate speech so clearly moderation here works an is benefitial
__label__Attack	How much hate speech is there really on newspaper comments sections? Usually a difference of opinion is enough for some people to lurch for the "hate speech" card in order to get a comment removed because they don't like a different viewpoint.
__label__Position	Addressing hate speech does not mean limiting or prohibiting freedom of speech. It means keeping hate speech from escalating into something more dangerous, particularly incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence, which is prohibited under international law. https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech
__label__Position	Hate speech cannot be reduced unless we completely prohibit online discussion which is totalitarian. We need comments sections that allow freedom of speech but with moderation for offensive or derogatory words and phrases.
__label__Position	The internet has enabled the sharing of ideas and viewpoints we would not have otherwise have encountered. We can't allow a minority of people to ruin the richest source of opinions and ideas we have ever had access to.
__label__Position	I do not think reader comments should be suppressed however those which express hate speech should perhaps be partially redacted or clearly marked as offensive / likely to cause upset. I'm unsure how this could best be achieved, as I agree with the point made that using an algorithm could unfairly quash some legitimate political points, alongside the suppression of opinion by over-zealous editors who could suppress those opinions which fall outwith their own spectrum.
__label__Position	I think that it's right that some controversial newspapers limit comments because members of the public are not informed enough to comment or commenting gives them a platform to spread misinforamtion e.g., on climate change. Algorithms should therefore be used to preserve comments but filter out negativity, misinformation and abuse.
__label__Position	By use of an algorithm that filters out misinformation and abuse. This would still enable free speech but not to the detriment of science or those that are vulnerable.
__label__Position	Giving people the opportunity to provide their comments in a mediated and balanced way would enable free speech and allow the public to be more informed. Comments that are mediated or filtered by an algorithm would reduce hate speech and limit an echo chamber.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	Free speech should trump hate speech because hate speech can also be interpreted as political speech where by dissent of the prevailing political and cultural agendas are not accepted or an attempt is made to use "hate speech" to create a stigma around political agendas that are unpopular.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Attack	It may be a high-cost approach, but worthwhile for our modern society to prioritise for the good of a healthy, functioning nation.
__label__Support	I appreciate the balance here.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Attack	Sometimes newspapers are very skewed and/or publish incorrect information. This approach would make it harder for people to question facts and stats/the content provided.
__label__Attack	People may stop reading news sites if they don't feel able to interact with them as they have been able to previously. This could lead to people seeking their news info all the more from highly unregulated/skewed sources, such as social feeds.
__label__Attack	Creates a platform for fake news
__label__Support	There is very little space for fake news to emerge as media houses would have approved the content or regulated the comment
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	Rules will need to be put in place to make this work. But I agree it's worthwhile.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Support	It could reduce the presence of hate.
__label__Position	make sure all people who wish to comment have a genuine log on and have to provide true information so they can be tracked if they use hate speech and face charges.
__label__Position	There needs to be proper moderation of comments so that no hate speech slips through the net. This would make more work for the newspapers but would only require one person to constantly monitor what is being submitted and only allow reasonable comments.
__label__Attack	I think it would take more than one person in many cases and have heard that professional moderators have to have appropriate support and training due to the nature of items that can be posted to such sites.
__label__Support	I think moderation is key, so do agree!
__label__Attack	The disadvantage of having free speech it causes people to think it is Ok to bully, lie or name call other people and this causes more chaos and leads to more hate which is not the path that most newspaper websites want.
__label__Position	Given stories or topics that comment on our social space,free speech should be communication that can express thoughts and opinions, debates on how we feel about any particular information.
__label__Position	Allowing bullies to have free speech is not fair on anyone reading articles who may be offended by what bullies may say. The majority in society are not bullies and should not be subjected to seeing hate speech from small minded bigots who cannot express themselves without attacking others.
__label__Position	In todays world where Artificial intelligence is a thing, it would be very easy to remove hate speech in the comment section without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	I think also having a different social media outside the website to give opportunity for people to have an open discussion regarding whatever was written. In this way if someone commit hate speech on a social media site than it will be easier to remove them from the discussion.
__label__Position	I think the solution lies in the use of moderators, preferably with those who've undertaken training, alongside AI technology to ensure that thoughts/debates in the comment remain hate-free. I am on the fence as to whether real-life details should also be added, due to concerns for some vulnerable users' security. However, this is an option that newspaper websites could also investigate.
__label__Position	Perhaps newspapers could use similar tools to respondology (https://respondology.com/ ) or hive moderation (https://hivemoderation.com ) that can identify and block hateful speech. This might well work and I think both of these use AI.
__label__Position	Many people are against the reducing of hate speech from newspaper article, and I am with them on this. The main reason for putting comment section on newspaper websites was for readers to leave a comment, people will always have something to say whether it is good or bad. But AI can still be used to remove comments that can be severely harmful.
__label__Attack	It's important to allow people to provide their own commentary
__label__Position	Readers should not be given a false assumption on the understandings of others.
__label__Attack	Negativity
__label__Support	Open facts
__label__Support	I think this is very important. Hate speech will drive away advertisers as they will not want to be associated with hateful comments. Newspapers will have to stop those comments to retain revenue. Facebook has started to process and it is about time other media outlets follow. https://www.facebook.com/community/whats-new/new-tools-features-nurture-community/
__label__Position	Freedom of speech can be used as catch-all term to justify the use and propagation of bigoted and hateful language. If we accept that some language is not acceptable due to it's clearly hateful nature then we have to acknowledge that some form of censorship of those particular instances has to occur. I would suggest that eliminating all such spaces from newspaper websites would have a massive detrimental effect on valid, non-bigoted, freedom of speech a cornerstone of western life. We don't ban all cars because some people speed dangerously, we monitor the roads and ban the bad drivers. I suggest that as long as readers comments are monitored continually they should remain.
__label__Attack	I agree, this is a very measured resoonse.
__label__Position	Use moderators and algorithms to detect hateful language and scramble it.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Support	More understanding
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Attack	Research suggests that platforms have a responsibility to moderate hate speech on platforms in a bid to keep the internet open and healthier: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/247 01475.2022.2105123
__label__Attack	I agree that we have to be very careful around censorship. Shutting commentary down because it doesn't fit your agenda or internal narrative can be very dangerous as it is a tool used by dictators.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Attack	agree as it can sometimes be very harmful
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Under current laws, restauranters are responsible for hate speech among their diners, so I certainly think platform owners should be responsible for the presence of hate speech on their websites. Hate speech is a criminal offence, after all.
__label__Attack	Hate speech is very different to valid criticism.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I agree to this
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Support	Fixing the root cause would be most beneficial.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Attack	An issue is how can we differentiate being aggressive from being passionate. This only leaves room for newspapers to censor comments they do not like.
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Support	This is exactly what should happen in all comments section! Only then people will learn to be respectful of others
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	Reasonable advice
__label__Support	Statement made with knowledge
__label__Support	Well thought argument. But most people are over 18 years old and are deliberate in spewing hate its unlikely that they will be re-educated if they have chosen to be bad apples
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Support	I tend to agree.
__label__Attack	We live in democratic countries where views of ordinary citizens matter. So yes def there must be comment sections
__label__Position	Even though I am generally curious to read other people's comments, I think the best would actually be to eliminate comments altogether, or restrict to the way paper news work, i.e. you can write a letter and they might publish it next time.
__label__Support	I tend to agree with this. In this way editors have a close look to what opinion can be published and which one entails hate speech.
__label__Position	I enjoy reading through comments and I don't think that they should be removed, but there should be a lot more monitoring going on to remove any hateful ones as soon as they are posted.
__label__Attack	How will all the content be monitored.
__label__Attack	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button
__label__Attack	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button
__label__Attack	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button
__label__Attack	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button
__label__Attack	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button
__label__Attack	yes a agree with this idea it will bee good to have a report button
__label__Position	Set out clear rules for commenting, moderate the comments and remove those which don't adhere to the rules.
__label__Position	Increasing the monitoring of comments made on a post will prevent the propagation of dangerous viewpoints and scams performed on people as no control over the content published create spaces for this to take place.
__label__Support	Freedom of speech
__label__Position	Monitoring hate speech I think is the best way to initially deal with the problem. I think it is unfair to remove space for readers comments. People use these spaces to reassure their own decisions in some cases.
__label__Position	A report comment button might help if this is on all comments and is looked at as soon as someone reports a comment. And removed if needed
__label__Position	The only way to combat hate speech is through open debate. Restricting any form of speech (even hate speech) could lead to hateful views becoming unchallenged and potentially result in violence. There is also the issue that newspapers could define hate speech as certain comments they don't like destroying any potential for open debate. By maintaining open debate hate speech can be called out and as a result, become less frequent.
__label__Support	I agree, as people need to be made aware that sometimes, what they say and think could offend other people.
__label__Position	report comment buttons could be useful but there should be monitors that check comments before they are allowed to be posted
__label__Position	Some hate speech is actually illegal, so that should definitely be reported and removed. https://www.report-it.org.uk/reporting_internet_hate_crime
__label__Support	i agree, there should be monitors to stop this practise
__label__Support	I agree, reported and removed. The person should also be given a statement reasoning as to why they were removed and reported. They could also be given warnings for this.
__label__Support	This is true in other countries as well, where even bills are put in place to silence those who effectively take part in hate speech. https://www.sanews.gov.za/south-africa/hate-speech-bill-will-assist-fight-against-racism#:~:text=The%20bill%20aims%20to%20provide,crime%20and%20hate%20speech%20offences.
__label__Position	By blocking those users who spew hate speech completely. The page could notify and warn all users prior that hate speech will not be tolerated
__label__Attack	I have yet to see a comments section that was in any way constructive. I could go onto MSN any day and if I were to read a news story, in particular any where a young person has died from anything related to drugs or knives, and there is zero concern for the person or their family, only criticism and sometimes blatant racism. I wish people were as you describe, but I have yet to see any evidence of it.
__label__Position	Most seem to agree that there should always be room for comments, with many suggesting the use of moderators and hiding comments. The issue with requiring moderator approval to post comments is it allows the moderator or newspaper to push a certain narrative, as I have seen in many groups on other social media platforms. It is much more useful allowing hateful comments to be confronted allowing a more balanced narrative.
__label__Position	It is clear that the issue is not going to be resolved either quickly or easily. Hate speech should be met with a zero tolerance attitude. Until however the issue starts to become monitored effectively, things will only then improve and give an indication of how to move forward.
__label__Position	https://master03.ou.bcause.app/distr#step-9
__label__Position	I think it is necessary to keep the comments sections open and not to discourage genuine people from posting their views. It is however necessary to block completely destructive comments.
__label__Support	I agree, Article 19 of the ICCPR guarantees the right to freedom of expression but also disallows discrimination. Restricting any sort of speech violates the right to freedom of expression and can be utilised by leadership or publications to discriminate. https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/international-covenant-civil-and-political-rights
__label__Position	There could be some kind of vetting process although this might not be practical - it would probably be too difficult to check each and every comment before allowing it to be posted. The other approach, apart from a basic check which blocks posts containing known 'hateful' words, is to rely on other users to report unacceptable posts and block the original poster. This isn't foolproof either as said poster can easily sign up with another email address and come back. It doesn't really seem like there is an easy solution and although it's not ideal, maybe preventing comments altogether really is the only way?
__label__Position	It is also in the newspapers own interest to put more effort into monitoring the comments section to avoid being held responsible for the comments. Although they should not sensibly be considered the publishers of the content themselves, they could be seen as connected to it in a secondary manner if they do not properly deal with its removal. https://www.presscouncil.ie/about-us/recent-decisions-and-news/combatting-hate-speech-in-print-and-broadcasting-media

__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	Free speech should only be allowed if it doesn't infringe someone else's right, like hate speech does.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	True
__label__Attack	But should we then allow "freedom of speech" to propagate into free hate speech for anyone to use on the platform. Only through learning and understanding that there are rules and responsibilities can one start removing forms of hate speech. There should be regulations put in place for offenders.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Attack	Algorithms are not always accurate
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Attack	I hear what your saying but of course there are things that can be done. Read some of the suggestions made below.
__label__Attack	People will always find other alternative ways to express express themselves. Removing the comments section is not the solution but it would help reduce cyber bullying and make the internet a safer space for people.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Attack	I agree that hate speech blocking reduces abuse, but abusers will find a way around it and discussion may be curbed accidentally. The issue with comments sections is the comments section itself, not just what's in them.
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Attack	As much as I agree with you that everyone should be able to express their own ideas. The internet is full of trolls who are constantly usung hate speech and without any guidelines or moderation. It's quite impossible for there not to be any "aggressiveness."
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	exclude certain words from being posted
__label__Support	I agree - ban certain words
__label__Attack	This won't catch everything
__label__Attack	the thing is people always find a way to say those certain words.
__label__Position	Block known accounts with a history of hate speech
__label__Attack	However, by doing that you may be limiting people's ability to express themselves positively too
__label__Position	By blocking people who have already put hateful comments on the newspaper's website before.
__label__Position	One way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for reader comments would to have active community managers who are activetly managing the comment section. Making sure that all comments are in accordance to the community guidelines.
__label__Support	I definitely agree with this. The website itself should take some responsibility as to what appears on the site. Offensive behaviour should not be permitted.
__label__Support	Reduces hate speech
__label__Attack	If there was identifiable information available (to the owner of the website), for people who contribute their opinions publicly, it would make people less inclined to say awful things.
__label__Position	I have already said that people who have already displayed hate speech on a website should be banned from giving their opinion.
__label__Attack	the things is they might create fake accounts or have bots commenting on their behalf.
__label__Support	Yes, I think that readers can also downvote a comment or flag it so that it can be brought to the moderator's attention and they should take action within a specified time frame.
__label__Position	Denying people of their freedom of speech is not the solution to eliminating hate speech. There should be a set of rules that when broken there will be serious consequences especially if the hate speech does more damage to a person's wellbeing.
__label__Position	I think that a comment section is necessary for engagement and exchange of ideas but having said that, there should be a code for AI embedded within that platform which will be able to detect hate speech or words classified as hate speech then the AI can delete them automatically. Also people can report the comment and the AI should delete the comment within minutes of it being reported.
__label__Attack	Although the idea of having AI is quite a good one. How accurate will this AI be in detecting hate speech?
__label__Position	Hate speech promotes cyber bullying and the spread of fake news. It is the responsibility of the newspapers to maintain their credibility by ensuring that they do not allow hate speech on their sites. They should have a better algorithm that will filter out hate comments or not even allow them to be posted at all.

Also people can report the comment and the AI should delete the comment within minutes of it being reported.
__label__Position	Have bots actively scan the comments section, unlike humans who for certain periods, bots can scan all day and act immediately on the flagged post.
__label__Position	Disallow comments. Discourse should take place in person, not in an anonymous forum. Discourse has evolved alongside human civilization, and anonymity has not been part of that until now. The conversations that happen online anonymously are not largely meaningful. It's self-defeating white noise, because it lacks social context.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	I would not want to see people suffering through hatespeech being allowed under the guise of freedom of speech. It is an excuse to allow hate.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Support	Agree with this, removing the space for commenting without educating people would just move the hate speech elsewhere.
__label__Attack	If your opinion degrades or harms an individual it is not needed. Removing it is the best option
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Support	I agree. People will take their words to other platforms such as twitter and Instagram anyway, a comment section is perhaps not needed.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Support	I think this is a good idea, I would start with education, if that is not helping then restricting the person from commenting.
__label__Attack	why was the comment removed
__label__Support	good decision to remove the comment
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	There are few forums for public discourse outside actual politics.
__label__Position	Give users the ability to flag or hide posts from users they deem to be participating in hate speech. If one account is consistently flagged or hidden, a manual review should take place to decide if the user should be permanently banned from posting.
__label__Position	Letting individuals know that as soon as someone comments, that is no longer confidential and if it is hate speech they shall be reported to authorities
__label__Support	i am behind this comment because people think they can just get away with hate speech because they are behind a keyboard. No it does not work like that. people should be helfdaccountable for their comments
__label__Support	I agree, this gives people the option to learn from mistakes before handing them a more severe punishment and that would be banning them or removing their comments
__label__Support	It is the way to go. Hate speech should not be allowed a space in society
__label__Position	It seems like there needs to be more emphasis on education before people get to the age of commenting on newspapers, if at this point people still don't understand what is and what is not hate speech, newspapers need to moderate comment sections by having a person or an algorithm flag comments that could be derogatory before they go live so that the conversation is not broken in the comment section. This allows for free speech while also trying to moderate and get rid of hate speech.
__label__Position	Overall, it seems that a public forum to share thoughts is important, but that free speech does not give the right to hate speech. Education of young people is important as a preventative, but doesn't help now, so monitoring to ensure that comments are respectful and appropriate is necessary. This could be done by humans or an algorithm, but I think a combination of both is important, to cover human error and ensure machines are working effectively.
__label__Position	The Council of Foreign relations says that there is a rise in violence linked to hate speech on social media (https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons). They say there is a range of attitudes to managing this in different countries, but all agree that something must be done. Free speech may be impinged, but avoiding these real-world, offline consequences is imperative.
__label__Position	Comment spaces should remain and other readers should be able to rate comments and flag them for removal if they are thought to be inappropriate. Moderators should be used with caution as there is a risk that they will behave in a biased way and not respect free speech.
__label__Position	Peer moderation - where users can upvote and downvote comments and can also report them if they feel as though the post is inappropriate or offensive. I do not believe that comments should be approved before posting and I think that having a team of paid moderators is both expensive and liable to accusations of the moderating being biased.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	I like this way of thinking. Allow everyone to comment however only a few comments are shown. Comments that are not hate speech
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	Hate speech should be taken as a form of free speech. If it degrades or inflicts harm on another individual if should not be regarded as hate speech
__label__Attack	'Free speech' does not mean the freedom to hurt others. It isn't a licence to offend and should definitely be regulated.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Support	I agree with this idea. It feels like the easiest one to apply or at least to start with. From what I know, there are no algorithms applying this on newspapers, so it would still be a starting point against hatred and aggressive behaviours.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	I agree that this question is subjective to an extent - news matter varies and can often be divisive or challenge certain views. However, I think moderation could first take into account the relevancy of certain comments (i.e. personal quips, etc.). Bullying or other clearly offensive comments (racist, sexist, ableist etc.) contributes nothing to a discussion, so it should be moderated. Comments that lend to the wider argument (however contrasting) should be regulated at the newspaper's own discretion.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Attack	I feel like we somehow need to be a little bit more specific on which tools could work, because many times it could also be difficult to set limits in what can be said and what not. I would say that we could use a sort of algorithm which can recognize offensive comments and delete them.
__label__Support	I definitely agree with your position, a certain level of regulation is needed, as looking at the current situation there are still many problems regarding online comments.
__label__Support	Moderation of comments would appear to be the most practicle solution
__label__Attack	It'a difficult to filter abusive comments
__label__Support	encourages social participation and reflection
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	Readers should be able to challenge the editorial views of the newspaper / individual journalist otherwise the newspaper just becomes an echo chamber.
__label__Attack	lack of freedom of speech
__label__Attack	newspapers write viewpoint without reproach
__label__Position	The solution lies in creating some sort of moderation on the comment sections and try to make people accountable for what they write in the comment section. There should be also a process to assure that there are no fake profiles and that the information given in the profiles it's true. Educating people on how to use comment section and creating accountability for their comments will help prevent hate speech in a less drastic way.
__label__Position	Because we live in a free land, we should be able to comment and say whatever we want
__label__Position	Newspaper websites should moderate their comments sections instead of leaving them as a free-for-all.
__label__Support	Good idea as this may deter many who are considering posting hateful comments, although it may not deter the die-hards.
__label__Position	Everyone shoould be able to express their own ideas but we could have some kind of protection in words the should not be allowed and also have a way to keep moderators on the website, people could be warned that they are doing something wrong and be explained that there IS NO HATE SPEECH and be offered maybe some way to express herself without hurting or damaging others.
__label__Support	I agree, it should not be removed but rather directed
__label__Position	Removing the comment section will not solve the problem. It will just create a filling of censorship and will make debate and dialogue vanish. It is important that people discuss news topics and also give feedback on those news to the newspaper. It is important to moderate this comments in a strict no hate speech way and bring accountability in. Eliminating comments will just hide a problem that needs to be fixed by moderating and educating people.
__label__Position	Censorship of hateful words, phrases and names should be blocked to supplement moderation.
__label__Support	1
__label__Support	100% agreed, has this would work has everyone needs to learn how to respect others
__label__Support	This is true, moreover as it is said in this article https://medium.com/@flytedesk/the-pros-and-cons-of-removing-a-website-comment-section-9bea62f8e42b, removing a comment section might be thought by some users as a going against free speech and they will also spend less time on the website, leading to worse performances of the brand/website.
__label__Position	People may not accept or have different ideas. There is no need for Hate speech and people dont know when or where is appropriated to use some of the terms, as well using punctuation which some times leads to different ways of speaking. we need to accept that we are different but all the same by the end.
__label__Position	Block online haters. If someone is making negative or hateful comments on your posts or account, or is cyberbullying, block them. If they’re threatening you, tell your parents, report it to the platform, and take screenshots.
__label__Position	Many children and teens don’t want to be a part of negative behavior like name-calling, criticizing, bullying, and cyberbullying. Dealing with haters isn’t that different from dealing with bullying and cyberbullying. Teens who feel overwhelmed by all the drama on social media will often unfriend or unfollow people online to disengage.
__label__Position	Often, haters pick on people whom they perceive as being different from themselves. Being the focus of negative and critical comments can be upsetting and trigger feelings of anger, hurt, and confusion, and cause the person being criticized to question their self-worth and behavior. If the negative comments are posted online, it can also make someone afraid to use their social media accounts or feel ashamed of what is happening there.
__label__Position	The problem with trying to regulate hate speech on the internet is that the internet is too big. There is a grey line between hate speech and freedom of speech and it often differs based on where you are from. The internet is not always bound by strict speech laws of one specific countries. Focus should also be placed on how people should react to hate speech and educate them on appropriate responses to such. https://theconversation.com/the-challenge-of-drawing-a-line-between-objectionable-material-and-freedom-of-expression-online-108764
__label__Position	I kind of agree, but I think that organisations have a responsibility to put something in place to monitor their comment sections. Even if it's not an algorithm and it's an actual person instead! Although your link shows how difficult this would be for a huge organisation like FB.
__label__Position	I can understand this argument, it would solve a lot of problems, but not all comments that people make are hate speech. Eliminating the space means that other helpful comments that generate ideas are removed too.
__label__Position	Again I think that removing comment sections entirely would overall be a negative thing. Yes, there are people who abuse the comments section and it they can use it to promote hate speech, but with the right tools this could be moderated. Removing comment sections entirely leaves us with a lack of space for healthy discussion and debate, new ideas and opportunities for learning
__label__Support	new ideias and opportunities
__label__Position	Totally agree with this. Not everyone uses the comments section for negative reasons, and I think comments help people generate and share ideas that can be helpful too.
__label__Position	Moderation and regulation needs to be performed by both the newspaper itself and the platform. To my understanding this is performed currently through Facebook, though as some other comments allude to, is done mostly by bots with no human review (leaving this open to incorrect interpretation). Blanket comment bans would remove the ability for open and healthy discussion, but some moderation is necessary to combat bullying and other prejudicial stances expressed online.
__label__Attack	i dont think is right
__label__Position	hate speech is good
__label__Attack	eliminating space for readers comments? is that the right approach?
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Attack	Censuring people will not solve the problem. People should be made accountable and educated
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Support	You can always talk in person freely or private conversations
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Support	Absolutely - and it is essential that these behaviours are addressed through better education on diversity and inclusivity.
__label__Attack	while you cant express yourself on that post doesnt mean you cant be open in other places where may be more appropriated
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Support	I like this idea, I hope everyone is able to be respectful to each other but unfortunately this is not always the case
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	It could be done manually at first but then an AI machine could learn from the manual responses to determine what is considered hate speech
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea that is a very good read to where to start finding point
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Attack	If the cancel that section then where will we be able to say what we feel. They will be robbing us of our free speech.
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Support	Agreed. Education is so important, without education I know I and some of my friends would not be as understanding about others, it is a really important part of life and being able to be educated is a major step to stopping this.
__label__Attack	However, some people may unfortunately not want to be educated and may still believe this stuff, but in that case no amount of removing comments, hate speech or education would help them, so they're already a lost cause.
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	Allows people to be able to comment on current events while eliminating the issues of hate speech
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	By creating rules that state you can't say things you wouldn't be comfortable saying in real life. Having automated monitoring of hateful slurs and create warning for posts that seem hateful based on an AI model.
__label__Attack	How can the classing system be done, through examples?
__label__Position	Its normal to ne worked out by certain news. Emotions are not the same some of us we get worked out easier.
__label__Position	I believe if we can be on the same page and let the media tell the story the truth with out lashing out on it.
__label__Attack	True but sometimes the media can provide false information
__label__Attack	Is there a limit as to what hate speech is and what it isn't? Could someone write the rules to be overly enforcing and cause more issues and more hate?
__label__Position	Education is important but may not be helpful to those who refuse to learn, but if someone is at that point, removing comments is likely going to make them more angry, some people may just need their comments individually removed.
__label__Position	While censoring certain words in the context of a comment would help reduce hate speech, an issue that would need to be considered is the use of images used as hate speech. Some "memes" can contain hate speech to the AI may misinterpret this as a regular image while the image could be posted as hate speech. An example of this is when people on Reddit use images as "memes" containing racism and sometimes the bot does not flag it as racism. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476420982230
__label__Support	A good point, a lot of memes may be seen as offensive and may be flagged as such. There is the man I saw on the news who made a video for YouTube and made his dog do an offensive stance as a joke and ended up with prison time, it depends on how far a joke could go and the stance of those seeing the joke. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-43478925
__label__Position	By totally eliminating the comments section because most it kills reporters confidence and it may lead to hate speech and fake news
__label__Attack	It is still difficult because then you are removing everyone's entitlement to an opinion
__label__Position	comment sections shouldn't be removed. I think the website should determine themselves what comments they want to allow and not. Having comments allows readers to challenger the writer and gives credibility to the website. Moderating comments will probably lead to less hate speech but there will still exist comments that are unfairly removed https://eu.freep.com/story/opinion/2021/04/30/why-comments-website/4870575001/
__label__Support	We should try and make the internet a more welcoming place.
__label__Attack	Differing opinions mare easily recognized for what they are. Whereas as hate speech can spark a lot of dangerous events. The comment's section helps people share knowledge easily and if it's not serving that purpose then it should not be allowed. https://researchoutreach.org/articles/hate-speech-regulation-social-media-intractable-contemporary-challenge/
__label__Position	Addressing hate speech should not mean prohibiting freedom of speech which is what you will be doing if the comments' section is removed. Instead a way to reduce the hate speech from escalating into something dangerous must be sourced and implemented. https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/UN%20Strategy%20and%20Plan%20of%20Action%20on%20Hate%20Speech%2018%20June%20SYNOPSIS.pdf
__label__Position	Balancing the right to free speech and the illegality of hate speech is a complex task. The best way to do it would be to have individuals check newspaper websites comments and decide themselves based off of existing statutory and common law. However, this is unlikely to be able to be done due to the manpower necessary and as such an AI which can do this would be needed.
__label__Position	I think there is room for AI to filter comments that refer to any sort of hate
__label__Position	there is no way to prevent hate speech totally, flagging comments for a moderator to deal with is probably the best way of preventing it
__label__Position	Hate comments should never be allowed or condoned
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.

__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Support	there's always going to be some sort of criticism of freedom of speech
__label__Support	Less people expressing there hate online does not mean that hate crimes will decrease in numbers. It will be just harder to prosecute people
__label__Position	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	Comment sections seem rather pointless anyway and are just usually vessels for people to argue. There's social media nowadays to weigh in on your opinion
__label__Support	totally agree should never be condoned
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Attack	Removing hate speech is not the same as removing the ability for everyone to present their opinion : https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Attack	some ideas are extreme and inconsiderate
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	I agree that human moderators are necessary to reduce hate speech. However, I am concerned that not all websites may have the necessary financial and staffing resources to implement human moderation. I like that submitting personal information is necessary as a cost-effective means to reduce hate speech. However, I hope that the personal information will be verified, and the information will be used to promote change rather than to punish individuals. In this regard, laws may be necessary to protect online commentators.
__label__Position	Regulatory board for regulating content on news papers
__label__Attack	great idea
__label__Position	Have guidelines to control what is allowed to be commented.
__label__Position	You can reduce hate speech by moderating the comments, banning repeating offenders and requiring a phone number to create a account.
__label__Position	I think that no comment section is generally an improvement over a completely unmoderated comment section, for any online site/community over a certain size. However, comment sections can add value to a article and extend the discussion beyond it. One option is to employ moderators to actively remove hate-speech and other problematic content, but if this is unfeasible then self-moderation of comment sections can sometimes work well (e.g. Reddit, with up/downvotes). The latter seems to be dependent on the community though, and can lead to echo chambers developing.
__label__Position	A moderator can check before someone's post goes in public. Like on the many forum websites.But still need to leave freedom of speech but not hate speech of course.
__label__Position	Regulating hate speech in the comment sections is no problem, the problem is with media outlets that are exempted from this regulation and they can delivery any type of content, offensive and non offensive without getting censored
__label__Position	One cost-effective way to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites while promoting reader comments is to outsource reader comments to social media. Comment sections can show comments for the article from social media platforms, while encouraging users to post comments onto these platforms. This way, hate speech can be reduced by social media platforms, which are more experienced with content moderation, have extensive rules in place, and have economies of scale with regard to content moderation compared to newspapers.
__label__Attack	Social media platforms are far from perfect at dealing with hate speech, it may even be detrimental because it would allow a lot more people to comment and therefore a lot more hate could potentially be displayed
__label__Position	I think there has to be a system that can verify whether a person's comment contains hate speech and if it is found to contain hate speech, that person should not be allowed to leave the comment.
__label__Attack	People constantly find their way around word filters and more often than not it filters a lot of genuine non hate comments too.
__label__Attack	People bypass these filters in a large number of ways that are hard to stay ahead of. A simple method for example is replacing an E with a 3 in a word so egg becomes 3gg. It is still pretty clear what is being said and bybasses the system that says I can not use that word for example.
__label__Position	newspapers are unlikely to policy it as no publicity is bad publicity to them. the more engagements they get, the better.
__label__Position	Rarely some very sensitive articles should be allowed to switch off comments sector.
__label__Position	People should be told about hate speech and how it affects other people and I think people who participate in hate speech should have some sort of panishment.
__label__Attack	I believe that punishment would cause more polarization because people may have more negative feelings towards newspaper websites with comments sections. Like what AllisonK said, education is a better preventative measure. If punishment is necessary, it should involve education that the commentator actively engages in.
__label__Position	Many people believe that hate speech can be reduced by eliminating comments. I don't believe this works, because by removing comments, we remove a sense of common understanding as well by removing different perspectives. I agree with AliceW that hate speech can be reduced through moderation, but I disagree that it can be reduced through self-moderation, as newspapers should have an authoritative stance instead of being reduced to a forum where echo chambers develop.

__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.

__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Attack	Arguably it could be in the newspaper's self-interest to police hate speech even if we say that it's not necessarily their responsibility, as moderation of comment sections has been shown to reduce perceptions of bias of the article itse lf (see e.g. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369118X.2017.1356861)

__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.

__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	I don't actually know what the evidence is about reducing hate speech so I feel unqualified to comment.
__label__Position	by not revealing identityof commentators
__label__Position	Have it monitored
__label__Position	I think that officials are wanting to remove the ability for free speech because they want to control what and how members of the public think.
__label__Position	by removing our ability for freedom of speech means that governments will be able to control the information in the public domain. I believe this is something that will never change nor be won.
__label__Position	in terms of hate speech, rules and regulations should be in place to control how people express themselves without hurting others.

__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Attack	most people dont bother to read more, they just look at the quick soundbites without thinking if they are fake or not
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Attack	I agree that some regulation and introduction of the standards of communication is necessary to allow for maintaining comment space open for everybody.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people.

__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	This solves one problem - no one can then be offended
__label__Attack	I think my last comment was the wrong way round...
__label__Support	Sorry this one was too
__label__Position	I definitely think newspapers should remove the comment space because it encourages trolls and hate speech
__label__Attack	if comments spaces are removed it also lessens freedom of speech
__label__Position	Whilst newspapers have allowed hate speech in their comment sections, they themselves are biased in their opinions whether to one side of an argument or another and this shows in the news items printed. Perhaps having to give verified personal information before commenting might stop trolls and hate speech.
__label__Position	As much as it might seem an attempt to constrict expression of thought, I agree comments should no longer be allowed. It always turns into argument and insult. We already know that for every opinion someone else will take the opposite view. A newspaper's view is its own, so let's keep it that way - we already know which way they lean politically. Keep opinions to social media and let people thrash it out there.
__label__Support	Its true that the old way we used to read newspapers were without comments so we should just do that now online to stop all the hate speech.
__label__Position	I think it would be hard to use moderators due to the sheer volume of comments. How could this be patrolled 24-7?
__label__Position	Newspapers should be a pleasure to read and not make you angry after reading comments not having comments will make them more pleasurable to read again.
__label__Attack	If you only hear things you agree with how can you grow and develop as well as develop your position so that it is defensible when its challenged
__label__Position	MSM needs to be more accountable, along with social media sites. it's a very devisive world.
__label__Position	By introduction of standards and moderation by set rules. - that would allow for posting ‘exchanging thoughts as long as they adhere to generic rules of the platform.
__label__Position	I am proposing the use of AI to manage this space
__label__Support	good idea if the AI was reliable
__label__Support	I tend to agree with this as the problem of entrenched ideas is increased with the echo chamber approach to collecting infrmation
__label__Position	I strongly believe is free speech and allowing people for exchanging their thoughts. However I do also believe that this is the responsibility of the platform to allow for free exchange of thoughts in a way that is safe for the participants. This could be done by introducing moderation and stipulation of a clear rules of enagment
__label__Position	Would the removal of comments be classed as removing freedom of speech? Can there ever be a comment section without some form of hate speech/ misinformation being added.
__label__Position	Large companies need to invest more money in having paiI td moderators to monitor hate speech on their articles. I think all speech excpet for speech inciting people to commit violence or murder should be allowed even if i so not agree with it. I think that to prevent hate sppech it will start with educating young people
__label__Attack	I would agree, with addition that also misinformation, especially one that could induce negative consequences should be treated the same as hate speech
__label__Position	Ask people to be respectful and back-up their opinions factually. The danger, of course, is attaching URLs or info that themselves propagate misinformation by presenting it as fact.
__label__Position	Exactly as BobP states, if you can have competent moderators then there is no valid reason to eliminate the space for readers comments. Genuinely competent moderators are skilled enough to delete, block, ban or report individuals who abuse comments.
__label__Position	How is hate speech differentiated from freedom of speech? Who defines this and how is it controlled?
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Support	I definitely agree with what you are saying. I think a lot of hate speech and aggression starts when a user doesn't agree with your opinion and thinking their truth is the only truth.
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Attack	Re-educating is key to reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Support	I think people take comments sections with a pinch of salt - they aren't creating fake news, they're often just expressing opinions, providing context or simply having fun.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Attack	what's the point in having comments at all if people are not allowed free speech?
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	I think moderation is better than asking for a lot of personal data.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	False information can then be removed, as well as with any comments that are harmful
__label__Position	read all comments before allowing them to be posted
__label__Position	Moderation will help maintaining the balance between letting people comment and reducing hate speech
__label__Position	It's not fair because it goes against freedom of speech imposed to humanity, however, some comments are rooted with evil purpose to degrade and humiliate the other party. as such, a strict policy on what actually gets published in the comment section should be enforced and any comment that violates it should be removed before it gets published.
__label__Position	I think keeping the comment section would be a more democratic solution, but as it is often used to spread misinformation and hate speech I wonder if it's really that necessary. Do people find a lot of use into reading other people's comments to an article anyway, apart from the curiosity it creates in the reader? There are plenty of other options for people to be engaged online and express their opinions on topics they care about anyway.
__label__Position	I think all comments must be moderated in order to reduce hate speech but at the same time it is fair for readers to give their feedback.
__label__Position	I think the best way is to block or censor certain words. Especially words that are synonymous with hate speech. Or better yet, have moderators in comments sections.
__label__Support	I agree in maybe censoring certain words but having moderators doesn't site well with me at all - it's getting to the point where only woke views are allowed to be expressed.
__label__Position	I think I would prefer to see that comments sections are removed rather than untruths being pushed at people.
__label__Attack	It's up to the reader to consider what is true and what is untrue. I think newspapers could do more to provide guidance on how to evaluate the reliability of sources.
__label__Position	AI that seeks to mute or censor certain words instead of removing comment section where individuals across the world interact about the topic at hand
__label__Position	Freedom of speech doesn't and should never encourage hate speech. The sad part about finding ways to reduce hate speech in comments section is the fact that it will lead to cencorship which is goes against reporting.
__label__Support	Guidelines and some automation (i.e. flagging the use of key words associated with hate speech, including swear words and racist nomenclature) could work.
__label__Position	Eliminating the comment space for readers seems to be an undemocratic solution that limits freedom of speech - however it remains to be seen whether expressing opinions at the end of article is the best or most affective way of expressing one's true opinions, considering that so many people lie or fake what they contribute to. If the section was to remain, a moderator that looks at the comments before they are approved could be a valid solution, as it would make sure that the comment adheres to certain standards and does not contain violence, racism and sexual content. It is a difficult topic and no matter the choice in the end not everyone is going to be happy.
__label__Position	I agree with some other opinions on the use of A1 to flag or censor certain words that constitute hate or violent speech. It would also be beneficial to have a human supervisor from the organisation and another external body review the activities of the AI to ensure accuracy and consistency.
__label__Position	it is the responsility of the newspaper team to ensure that no hate speech is in the comment section despite it being about journalism
__label__Position	Another article which covers how linguistics can change in hate speech is here - https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3394231.3397902. I think this is useful and I would like to see if that could be used across online newspaper comment sections.
__label__Position	If newspapers want to keep their comment section, they should perform some kind of moderation of the comments.
__label__Position	I previously expressed my position saying that I don't think the comment section of an article is necessary to keep - We don't want to undertake a monumental effort censoring or moderating thousands of comments, and I actually think the comment section of an article brings little value to the article itself, since the comments are often plagued with lies, misinformation and exaggerations. I believe the advantages of having the section doesn't pay off compared to the disadvantages, where so many people lie and offend others or start fights just for fun. Here is an article that summarizes my views quite well: https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation
__label__Position	By moderating the comment section. Instead of having an individual who may be biased in their moderation, the use of an artificial intelligence software can be introduced to moderate the comment section.
__label__Position	Evverybody should be able to express their opinions weather it iis critism or not at the end of the day comments are needed
__label__Position	The is no need to moderate comments they must be dished out raw as they are writen by the readers
__label__Position	If comments are to be allowed then as AliceW states, they shouldn't be tampered with or diluted otherwise what is the point or having comments at all?
__label__Position	I think newspapers website are not used as much now, as most people will use social media to comment about topics.
__label__Position	I don't think there is one solution that is going to solve the problem, there will always be people who are going to intentionally use hate speech, whether you re-educate or prove otherwise.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Attack	The problem is can an algorithm actually make the full determination of what is hateful and not? It may have the same biases.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Support	Taking away hate speech may not allow the audience to actually continue to express any opinions at all
__label__Attack	People often confuse with freedom of speech to think that this protects hate speech, it does not and should not
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Attack	Some opinions may be trigger ing to others
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	I'm not convinced this is a helpful input in its own way.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	Who is to say what is or isn't 'harmful'? It sounds like you want to control a good chunk of the population who don't agree with you on things.
__label__Support	I think when there are professionals they can be balanced and have training alongside guidelines which can help guide what is and is not allowed
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Support	Often people are just looking for information and news anyone. After all paper newspapers don't have a comment section that anyone can just have their comment appear in automatically!
__label__Position	I agree with this position since when providing personal data people would be less incentivized to starting hate speach
__label__Attack	They'd be less incentivised to start any speech. Who would agree to giving copious amounts of personal data to some faceless online entity just to make a comment?
__label__Attack	Well then what is your proposition
__label__Support	This is one of the most sane posts in this discussion. Thank you.
__label__Position	The author of the post can moderate all comments before allowing them on the page. This does present the issue that only the author's views will be portrayed
__label__Support	Absolutely agree
__label__Position	Firstly, newspapers need to enact a proper system of moderation. Blocking all comments infringes on free speech and does not allow readers to provide a counterpoint to the position provided in the article.
__label__Position	realistically hate speech cannot be eliminated but preventative measures cane be put in place to minimise its presence
__label__Attack	I agree that hate speech can never be completely eliminated
__label__Support	Allowing people to express their opinions ensures that there is free speech
__label__Support	I agree we can work to prevent it, but systems can be complicated to introduce or can be controversial in themselves
__label__Position	Totally agree . Users all human beings after all
__label__Attack	I think that a lot of comments can become personal or contain misinformation that does not really benefit anyone though.
__label__Position	Short answer is you can't, as the term 'hate speech' is incredibly vague, and can differ from person to person.
__label__Attack	Perhaps but a well defined policy by the newspaper should be able to indicate what is and is not allowed
__label__Position	What is characterised as hate speech needs to be assessed on a case by case basis. It is not absolute
__label__Support	Definitely, it can be very polarising in itself with a definition and cause more issue if the wrong thing is removed
__label__Position	Research has shown that hate speech can be effectively controled since freedom of speech is not absolute
__label__Attack	I agree most with this post, there's no reason to allow hate speech to exist on social platforms when it's so easy to moderate and control
__label__Position	There is a careful balance to be made between protecting others from the effects of hate speech and protecting free speech. Online hate speech unfortunately can have the effect of increasing violence against minorities (https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons) but blocking all free speech because of the actions of a few seems like a poor decision. More must be done to remove hate speech online quickly and this means spending more money tackling it.
__label__Position	Charactertisation of hate speech should be done case-by-case, rather than applied universally
__label__Support	I think that would be a good thing as there isn't really a way to predict how someone will react to specific words or general ideas used against them
__label__Support	I don't really think that any of the posts above really do touch the matter of this one so I can't really think of anything else to my argument here. (Evaluation as asked)
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	Yes, it is a very difficult balance and trying to find mechanisms that are fair and balanced to control these are basically impossible to find.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Attack	I disagree because it is still tolerating that intolerant people express themselves and make their opinions visible. Even if they are removed,it will take a while for that to happen and this hateful message may have already found an echo in another bigot.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	It would save people wasting time leaving unecessary comments on often trivial matters. Its like people who ring up the radio, most people dont bother or care. Those who do are usually idiots or have more extreme opinions.
__label__Support	Maybe just turn the comments off what are obviously polarising matters.
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	I think you are right to some degree Fabio. However wouldn't moderating some of the comments mean that we don't get an overall view of people's real views on a topic? Even if they are hateful?
__label__Support	This is an interesting point of view and I certainly believe that reducing the level of anonymity may help to moderate opinions.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	It is good to see alternative points of view presented on the page via reader comments. I think this can help to reduce the echo chamber phenomenon, particularly when readers cannot 'like' a comment.
__label__Position	Its too much to check every post. But one a person is reported they should be banned if they have been hateful. Its a lot of effort to keep re-registering and should serve as a strong deterrent.
__label__Position	Maybe we just cant and only filter what we can catch. Maybe if the world could move into a zone where they just ignoe hate speech. Perhaps it is rreported and just deleted with minimal fuss. Haters hate being ignored.
__label__Position	All the posts should be checked before being posted and verified by some sort of AI. Hate speech could affect a person's livelihood and mental state
__label__Attack	This could be considered less democratic and biased only showing positive comments. https://www.proquest.com/openview/87a0114d041605296b4dd4dd32634b4d/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750
__label__Support	I think this is true and there is no need for spiteful comments to be made and ruin someone's day.
__label__Position	There is still no right way to control and curb hate speech, and readers need to be educated about it. And while this work is done, the comment space should be removed to avoid creating yet another hate space.
__label__Position	Lets just apply common sense and filter it a little bit. Filter out the racism and other like offensive matters. What constitutes racism is obvious to a sensible person.
__label__Position	We should define what hate speech is, how people see hate speech, when it is considered hate speech. If we can answer these questions, we may be able to reduce hate speech.
__label__Attack	more teachers needed
__label__Support	will help in the long run
__label__Position	Possible solution could be to create users with membership rankings and incentives for positive behaviours.
__label__Position	The power of newspapers is too strong and needs to be restricted , moderation of the comments section is needed linked with non anonymous posting of mcomments
__label__Position	This might be an attractive business decision for the newspapers to avoid involvement with legal repercussions. This has unintended consequences for free speech.
__label__Position	If this behaviour of eliminating comments is existing at a business decision level then it may have a limited effect on free speech as outlets are funded by consumers after all. If the state is taking an active role to legislate against these outlets then there may be a problem.
__label__Position	Whilst it is not beholden on newspapers to provide a comment space, doing so can help to introduce moderating behaviour to a topic, as well as unfortunately introducing hate speech into a space. Provided comments are well moderated for harm (and moderators are fully supported to provide this service with robust mental health support) I think it can be useful to have a commentary space. Comments should be heavily moderated for any form of harm however and abusive users quickly banned.
__label__Position	I think it is much easier to moderate for explicit rather than insidious harm in comment. Perhaps there is not a perfect solution here but moderating would help to remove at least some of the the most obvious hate speech.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	freedom of speech is important but not at the cost of other rights
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Support	agreed
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I think the comment section is a good space for people to interact with the author instead of removing they should create or have an inbuilt AI that identifies bad words and mark the post as bad
__label__Support	Education would really help because what one person finds offensive might not apply on another
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	I don't think removing the comment spaceis a good idea, people should still be given a platform where they can voice themselves out. Having a team look through the comments and find those that include hate speach and remove them and maybe ban the people whith hatespeach comments from ever posting comments again.

__label__Position	I think criticism is valid when discussing topics and it allows people to express their honest opinions. However, everyone should be mindful about how powerful their words are and to articulate their opinions an appropriate manner.
__label__Position	They didn't do it to censor "hate speech", they have used it as a way to censor what people are talking about. Like vaccine side-effects, mass corruption and the propaganda campaign of the last few years. How can we FAIRLY do this? The only way is to remove ALL speech instead of going to so much effort to only allow certain people to talk about whatever the accepted narrative is at the time. The concept of hate speech is a joke and how it has been abused as a means to silence anyone who goes against the narrative is plain for everyone to see. So no need for convoluted software and systems and ridiculous ways of only allowing certain things to be said, just remove it altogether and stop pretending we aren't in some communist world order.
__label__Position	While comment moderation might be helpful for reducing hate speech, if human moderators are involved, it will be necessary to consider their wellbeing as well - one study found that "people moderating uncivil comments on news sites decreases their trust in the news outlet and increases their emotional exhaustion". https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/07/hey-comment-mods-you-doin-okay-a-new-study-shows-moderating-uncivil-comments-reduces-the-moderators-trust-in-news/

__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.

__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Attack	Some readers will give their honest response that will assist the writers where to change or improve
__label__Support	Need clear understanding of what is considered hate speech on this platform.
__label__Support	stops others from feeling they can also be mean
__label__Attack	Free speech may be impacted
__label__Support	Abuse and hate speech shouldn't be tolerated
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	Ban those who consistent ly abuse hate speech
__label__Position	There needs to be a moderator who is reviewing the comments that are made, I see a lot of inappropriate comments posted to news stories on the comments section of the news articles on facebook that incite arguments and hate speech. This is not acceptable and should not be allowed to happen.
__label__Position	Ensure monitorisation of comments by the publisher, to ensure hate speech is tackled. This should not involve deleting comments that are on the other side of debate however.
__label__Position	Reflecting on my comments, I believe hate speech should still be removed from the platform by modorators monitoring the comments section - the use of foul language / any form of racism, homophobia, name calling or any other general hate speech should result in a ban for specific users after a warning has been issued.
__label__Position	Hate speech can alter people's opinions against people who do not read the articles in detail, however, this should mean that people should pay more attention to the article itself before viewing the comments section
__label__Position	I think that people should sign up and verify their identity before they are able to leave a comment on a news platform so they are not anonymous and anything that is written can be tracked to the individual and they can be held accountable. Many people write such hateful things anonymously.
__label__Position	Cracking down on hate speech on newspaper websites is effective, but it only means that those spouting the speech go and do it somewhere else... https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/crackdown-on-online-hate-speech-pushes-extremists-to-other-platforms

Yiou could also add a way for the readers to flag inappropiate comments and these will also flag to the moderators.

__label__Position	https://www.niemanlab.org/2015/09/what-happened-after-7-news-sites-got-rid-of-reader-comments/
__label__Position	There are pros to allowing comments, as referenced by this paper: Allowing easy access to public participation and require minimal technological expertise, the reader comment platform can serve as a digital marketplace of ideas, enabling spontaneous dialogue among readers on critical contemporary issues (Hecht, 2003).
__label__Position	There are some words that are clearly hate speech i.e. slurs. Filters could ban use of these words, including common alternatives. Whilst I admit that there is some use of groups 'reclaiming' those words, I think in general filters could do a first step, low level job of filtering some hate speech.

__label__Attack	It may not be elimination, but reduction is better than nothing!
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	Don't delete the comment section, at some point you will realise that some criticism are inconsequential
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Attack	Those people can get away with the comment only if they are anonymous. Such nasty comments can block your connection in near future
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?

__label__Support	Agree with regulating it
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	Newspapers in print have a comments section that you can write in to give your opinions on, but the replies are moderated and checked. Online versions should have the same ability, differences of opinion should be embraced not stopped and can be moderated to ensure no hate speech is written within those opinions.
__label__Position	I am against removing it entirely, i believe it should be regulated
__label__Position	Hire moderators and similar positions, and also having filtering systems
__label__Support	It will help stop hate speech which is very important
__label__Support	Agreed
__label__Position	Having moderators remove hateful speech and providing better education.
__label__Attack	It will not give people the ability to have freedom of speech
__label__Position	By implimenting a system that can filter out all comments before the comment are added to the website
__label__Position	By implimenting a system that can filter out all comments before the comments are added to the website or newspaper for the readers to read
__label__Attack	I agree with this, as it creates a more safe space for everyone
__label__Position	I still think a filtering system of removing categorically hateful words could help a little, but there is still the big problem of other comments bypassing that. I think an independant and unbiased moderation team could help to remove the issue of the newspapers removing valid critisism or comments about inaccurate reporting for example.
__label__Attack	Human bias would still be at the very core of this moderation, but then again humans build algorithims too.
__label__Support	It would certainly be effective as there's a team solely focused on that.
__label__Position	Comments can be screened for hateful words or phrases via a list checked by appropriate charities or organisations, so as not to restrict free speech but reducing hate speech substantially
__label__Position	We should create a paltform for anyone to express their opinions and others able to respond to their view. With freedom of speech, the ideas will be filtered out.
__label__Support	I found counterspeech the most effective way. Other emphathy based counterspeech can be discussed as well.
__label__Support	The following article is supporting that https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2116310118
__label__Position	By enforcing moderation and review process to filter the views and opinions reflected in the newspaper wesbites, we are adding subjective filteration into the process which is not creating healthy environment for the freedom of speech.
__label__Position	I think having counter speech is something that could be of concern, as this would lead to arguments. Creating a platform particularly for that wouldn't be so good as people would go there to argue.
__label__Position	Removing comment space from online articles doesn't avoid people commenting. This article reflects on Canadian newspapers who have removed comment space but still posts its articles on Twitter & Facebook where people can comment - so hate speech can still be written. Moderating it is the only way to prevent it. https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2015/sep/25/is-it-really-a-good-idea-to-turn-for-news-websites-to-turn-off-comments
__label__Support	It will definetly help to reduce hate speech from the readers as no one will be able to comment
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	We need rules and governance as a society. We don't always have to say what we think especially when it constitutes hate speech. You can argue respectfully.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	The main question is how to determine what is considered as discrimination or violence. Opposing arguments can be flagged as discrimination or violense.
__label__Support	I think that it should be the responsibility of the news outlets to ensure that comments are fair and accurate.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Support	An algortithm can provide a cheap and effective solution that is available 24/7 to moderate
__label__Attack	There is a difference between freedom of speech and hate speech. One is neccesary, intellectual and somewhat constructive without being rude. The other is a global problem causing suicide attempts and mental health issues.
__label__Support	agreed. people will always want their opinions heard
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Support	This is correct, as blocking free speech altogether leads us into a very different type of society. It is a tricky dilemma, how to allow free speech but prevent hate speech, but one that does need attention and ideas
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Attack	journalists views become one sided, people can not engage to support.disagree
__label__Support	Reduces hate speech
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Attack	The creation of specific platforms to discuss this information often leads to groups with similar beliefs setting up their own platforms, which become a haven for hate speech and fake news
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	I agree. Articles are written purely so that they can absorb hate comments to boost th e post.
__label__Support	Standards which keep users behaviour respectful towards one another should be reinforced throughout discussion boards!
__label__Support	I think the idea is marvellous, it will prevent pointless comments that are intended to hurt other readers or those mentioned in the articles. If they are to be available for speculation. They would need to monitor the comment section and not delay in removing harmful comments.
__label__Attack	Moderators could be biased on subjective in their opinions.
__label__Support	This would allow comment sections to remain open while reducing hate speech.
__label__Support	people should be heard
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	everyone has the right to share their opinions, however online comments make it too easy for hate and discrimination to be spread with out consequences. There needs to be a way to stop the hate spreading but also still give people the oppertunity to express their comments so i think this is a good idea
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Support	This would reduce the risk of hate speech.
__label__Position	by rigorous moderating of the comments section or by implementing a bot that flags key hate words
__label__Support	That's a brilliant idea. Certain words do NOT need to be used and if they are they should be reviewed just incase.
__label__Attack	It also may be neccesary to use the words, but in light of this would give a person a chance to think before they type, so to speak.
__label__Position	it needs good moderating to weed out anything that could be described as hate speech
__label__Support	I agree, if we were to allow the public to have 'freedom of speech' We need to ensure someone who is unbiased can remove the comments that will only fuel hatred and not give a well structured opinion a chance.
__label__Attack	Too many people might find it offensive and may be sensitive to the article and therefore take 'opinions' more personally.
__label__Attack	Costly to the company to pay for dedicated moderators
__label__Support	makes people feel safe and undiscriminated against when going online
__label__Support	This may cost a company, but will also create jobs in our current stressful climate.
__label__Attack	People may not be trusted to keep the hate speech moderated.
__label__Position	Some newspapers open comments on only a selection of stories. This limits the burden on moderators and also prevents commenting on topics which are predicted to become unproductive or hateful in some way.
__label__Position	as long as good moderators are in place, hate speech and disrespectful comments will be weeded out.
__label__Position	as long as good moderators are in place, hate speech and disrespectful comments will be weeded out.
__label__Position	as long as good moderators are in place, hate speech and disrespectful comments will be weeded out.
__label__Support	Sometimes being harsh can be kind to the person who may not realise what they're doing.
__label__Support	yes. good moderators are the key
__label__Support	yes. good moderators are the key
__label__Support	yes. good moderators are the key
__label__Support	yes. good moderators are the key
__label__Support	yes. good moderators are the key
__label__Attack	On heavily discussed topics, there may be too many comments to properly moderate. The burden may be too high to manually do this.
__label__Attack	Regardless of whether stories need opinions added to them, people will do it anyway
__label__Position	have certain discriminatory words banned or hiden from being used at all, any comments thats unclude those banned words would then not be posted for failing to meet guidleines?
__label__Support	I like the idea of auto-moderation to automatically screen out comments with certain words that are considered hate speech
__label__Attack	people may still use illegal identification or find a way past the barriers
__label__Support	Companies will make more effort in regulating online presence if they are held accountable by law
__label__Position	we could use bots the get triggered when certain words are used. The bot will therefore remove the comment andhold it until it has mannually reviewed by a human. Another option can be to allow the users to report comments from other users and if the reports reach a certain threshold then hold that comment for review.

__label__Position	Companies aswell as the users should be liable and held accountable for allowing a platform to be used to share hate speech
__label__Support	I agree with this, as the issue of moderating newspaper comments also crosses the gap into social media where most newspapers will post their articles too.
__label__Position	Hate speech can mean different things to different people
__label__Attack	It can mean different things to different people, but there are also laws referring to hate speech which define it, albeit not always very clearly
__label__Attack	regardless of the nuance in hate speech, a platform can still manage it effectively using the laid out definitions but also can fill some of the gap by having a wider language policy that also includes the use of threatening and aggressive language
__label__Attack	the cost of paying someone to monitor this
__label__Support	this would allow people to express their views freely and in a safe and monitored way
__label__Position	Newspapers will be commented on in other spheres anyway. by separating this from the newspaper site itself this allows for almost anything to be said on the matter (depending on the controls in those spheres). The advantage to allowing a comments section on the site itself but also moderated and with a reporting system in place, allows for any misdirects or fake news that may pop up in the comments to be directly addressed along side the article and will allow peoples views and voices to be heard
__label__Position	another issue that needs considering is how those being accused of hate speech will frame their comments in relation to any ban/comment removal, as can be seen here : https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304422X19301159 there will be a way for people to defend their comments against censorship, putting newspapers in a difficult position regarding upholding free speech while also preventing free speech. this is a minefield to navigate for papers. however it is an important issue
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	Removing readers comments removes the users freedom of speech which is a basic human right
__label__Support	Less money has to be put into the system for moderating user comments
__label__Support	I don't agree with arguments that removing comment sections is an attack on free speech. People have multiple platforms where they can give their opinions (social media, emails, forums, conversations etc.). Newspapers aren't required to provide yet another place for people to converse.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Position	Hate speech is subjective and as such should not be censored
__label__Position	you can't if there is a comments box then those comments are individuals opinions and unless they are removed they stay for all to read
__label__Position	you can't
__label__Position	It is only with free speech we gain knowledge and approach the truth. We need to become familiar with a variety of beliefs and opinions in the world. We can reduce hate speech in newspapers by providing a logical and coherent argument against those who express it, rather than promoting a 'cancel culture'.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.

__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Support	The works for the newspaper only, no one will be able to contest what is being written evn if it is wrong
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also

__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people.

__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	I can understand the reason why that might remove some of the problem, but that argument is a bit like saying, some roads frequently experience traffic jams, so let's get rid of all the cars. What's more important is the effective moderation of hate speech - and also crucially to call out mistruths. Discussions are the starting point.
__label__Position	Have someone monitoring and deleting hate comments or automatically delete/hide comments with certain inappropriate words in them as specified by the company in charge
__label__Support	Absolutely correct. The important thing is to identify what hate speech actually means, because what is offensive to one individual might not be to another.
__label__Position	Moderation is key. Plenty of newspapers and online media are able to keep comments open with a bit of moderation.
__label__Attack	Completely correct, effective moderation is the answer.
__label__Position	By having algorithms to block certain phrases or words and constant flagging of concerning content. There would need to be moderators to check comments and remove them as necessary
__label__Position	I think the big thing here is moderation. Either with AI or real people. AI can be used superficially to remove comments that include profanity or slurs. Furthermore, having any comment go through moderation with a real team before posting can fairly reduce hate speech.
__label__Support	I agree. This sounds like a good plan.
__label__Position	I don't think censoring peoples opinions that you do not agree with on certain topics is in one a way or another a form of hate, I think it's a hypocrisy that you want your opinion to be heard, but also don't want the other side's opinion to be heard.
__label__Support	While I mostly agree, I question whether a newspaper's goal is engage in discussion. It would likely depend on the paper. Some print media is certainly for discussion.
__label__Position	To ensure freedom of speech is still maintained, moderation needs to be carried out fairly. To achieve this, we need to understand what is hate speech and what are the lines that seperate that with constructive criticism. Attached is an article by the Standford encyclopedia of physiosphy regarding hate speech. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hate-speech/
__label__Position	Hate speech is defined by the Cambridge Dictionary as "public speech that expresses hate or encourages violence towards a person or group based on something such as race, religion, sex, or sexual orientation".

__label__Position	Any hosting of a discussion on a website is the responsibility of the host company. Managing this responsibly is under their purview. There are benefits to allowing discourse, but that does not come without dangers. Over-censoring as well as under-monitoring will both do a disservice
__label__Position	More accountability is needed for not stamping down on hate speech
__label__Position	I agree that more education is needed and what comments are more likely to offend than others
__label__Position	I do not believe that removing the comment space is the answer. I feel a moderator would be a useful way of eliminating hate speech but still enabling people to have their say.
__label__Position	Comments could be checked for hate speech before going live.
__label__Support	I feel that people should be protected
__label__Support	Heavy moderation by the newspapers could prevent people being able to post their opinions
__label__Support	Could be effective to some extent as it could prevent hate speech being available on these websites
__label__Position	Could ensure moderation of commonly used words for hate speech, and frequent moderation on these websites
__label__Support	Could be successful in reducing hate speech and controlling potentially harmful hate speech.

__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Support	Newspapers operate under their own distinct ownership and can thus set their own policies. Stores have their own methods of queuing for product, concert venues have their own methods of admitting attendees. Sites have no obligation to allow unsupervised public discourse.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	It is their responsibility though because if someone feels unsafe on their platform due to hate commentary then they lose customers and in some eyes may endorse hate speech by not doing anything to address it or try and filter it.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.

__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	Some people may set up fake details / profiles in order to still post the hateful comments.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Support	You can't censor everybody because of the behaviour of the few. Better to deal with the keyboard warriors individually
__label__Position	I don't think we can police websites 100% but if comments are moderated I think we can reach quite a high degree of compliance
__label__Position	Hate speech will always appear on open forums. The problem stems from how to stop this from happening.
__label__Support	https://www.positivemessengers.net/en/news-en/253-how-to-end-hate-speech-some-good-ideas-that-actually-work.html
__label__Support	We need some approaches to actually preventing hate speech and putting an end to it.
__label__Attack	Newspapers are nationally available.As are there websites.Whilst newspapers cant be held responsible for the comments of its readers ,i do think they should have a moderater to delete harmfull posts that could offend.
__label__Support	I think people need to be educated more on hate speech and better ways to get their points across.
__label__Position	I think hate speech is always going to be a problem unfortunately, and although websites can monitor comments and remove any hate speech what ultimately is needed is teaching people there are better ways to get their opinions across and better use of freedom of speech.
__label__Support	I agree with this and also think it is going to be a difficult one to get right for newspapers.
__label__Position	I agree that moderators would be a good way to look at individual comments as the would likely be more effective than a computer program. If the public could also flag offensive comments this would go a long way to helping the moderators to look at potential offensive comments
__label__Position	The only possible way to reduce hate speech is to have some kind of algorithm that may recognise certain words and phrases. Other than that it would mean moderating the comment section.
__label__Attack	Algorithms dont always get it right
__label__Support	Saves having a human moderator soft through hundreds of comments.
__label__Position	Monitoring hate speech can become a very tedious process if it is left for humans to do. Sifting through hundreds, if not thousands of comments is a very time consuming process. Then to add to that, some moderators may or may not agree that a certain comment needs to be moderated.
__label__Position	Educating the masses to tolerate is a must in todays society. You will always have trolls but the general public that is easily swayed by media need education that diversity is important and not a bad thing. Media needs to take responsibility in how it shapes peoples thoughts.

__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	The public are not experts and their views should not be publicised as such.
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Support	This was a great way to show what will happen to free speech
__label__Attack	This has the potential to make the community look barren and devoid of chat with lots of comments being removed. Look at some of the political sections of reddit.com for examples
__label__Support	This is a great read on the pros of a law
__label__Support	free speech
__label__Support	allows you to read other people's opinions to help build your own
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	Strict content moderation
__label__Attack	Time consuming
__label__Position	the only way it could work is by having a balanced team of moderators to scrutinise eah comment
__label__Attack	who recruits these moderators, who chooses their criteria for what is hateful vs what's not?
__label__Position	There have to a way to remove hate speech before it could reach the comment space, the comment space is important because some people will help to improve the online newspaper
__label__Support	I tend to agree, can not think of 1 example where the comments led to a positive change
__label__Position	I have found research (Read here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7323766/) that hateful comments can make people question the credibility or research etc. Whilst we definutely shouldn't agree with every research finding, and its good to question things, should the normal person who has little understanding of a topic be able to comment hate and reduce the integrity of news stories which are backed by years of education on the subject? Perhaps comment section can be more harm than good, especially if simply anyone can comment
__label__Position	hate speech online will always be there and we shouldn't focus on hate speech a lo because there will be a lot of positive comments
__label__Position	the comment section should be monitored by real people on a regular bases and any accounts found to be using hate speech banned permanently.
__label__Position	I think most of us agree that measures should be put in place to reduce hate speach, and hate in general. So if a newspaper enables a comment section, then yes, they should ensure that hate speech is not admitted there, but how far should that go? And who decides? I think lies should also not be allowed in the comments section as they can be equally dangerous and can question the integrity of the newspaper, even though they had nothing to do with the lie in the comment section. All this would be practically impossible to control though unless you hire staff to do so, but I feel its a waste of already low funds that should go to good reporting and investigating. Removing the comment section would be best. Its not a forum for comments but to report facts and events. If you want to comments, go to blogs etc, or even, dicuss it with others, in person!
__label__Position	turning off comments actually lowered the amount of time readers spent on the site https://www.techdirt.com/2021/11/08/killing-website-comment-sections-wasnt-brilliant-move-many-newsroom-leaders-assumed/

__label__Position	hate speech is everywhere online, we can never run away from it but there have to be away to deal with hate speech without removing the comment space
__label__Position	Research shows that letting comments proliferate with little oversight is a “dangerous recipe,” Andincivility and negative comments can have a long-term impact. Certain commenting software use algorithms meant to flag problematic comments, but machines can only do so much. Should newspapers really be spending already depleted resources on monitoring comments?

__label__Position	You can't reduce hate speech because it's a societal problem and not a technological problem.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Support	hate speech i s not related to freedom of speech
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Attack	will not work at all the dynamics of the comments section are very polarised
__label__Support	the website could give raise this this awareness and have a open discusion
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Support	I don't think it will make a difference. People will comment elsewhere. Fake news spreads more rapidly on social media than from the comments section of a newspaper website. I think the whole issue is being over thought.
__label__Support	Perfect
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Position	There are a couple of ways to do that: * Increasing the number of moderator. They can constrantly moderate the comments and enforce perma-ban.
__label__Position	Ensuring there are rules to adhere to, perhaps muting certain offensive words or phrases. Making sure commnect sections are heavily monitored.
__label__Position	I think that people should be able to express their views, but there has to be some moderation in place to avoid any hate speech. Removing the comments section from newspapers might encourage people to go to other sources to write their opinions and it could create even more hate speech against the topic as well as the newspaper. if it is moderated at the source, then the haters can be dealt with there and others will be able to give their opinions.
__label__Position	I think there should be consideration for free speech but appreciating that free speech does not allow for people to contribute hateful and harmful hate speech. I don't believe free speech equals hate speech but offering opinions with the intention of not producing any harm to any person or group. I think it is compleetely fair to remove hateful content and I think the idea of reachin g out to those who have offered harmful content is good, but is limited when put into practice.
__label__Position	As with some of the other comments, perhaps if hate speech really is a concern that removing the option to be able to so could be the best option, but I still think that this can be moderated
__label__Position	HAVE RULES ON WHAT CAN BE POSTED AND HAVE SOMONE CHECKING FOR NASTY COMMENTS . IN THAT WAY PEOPLE CAN EXPRESS THEIR OPINIONS WITHOUT HATE SPEECH. AND PEOPLE CAN BE TOLD OR GIVEN WARNINGS TO HAVE THEIR COMMENTS REMOVED IF THEY DO NOT FOLLOW THE RULES. IT WILL ALSO HELP TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE MODERATOR TO CHECK THE CONTENT.THERE SHOULD ALSO BE WARNINGS OF BLOCKING THOSE WHO GIVE SUCH SPEECHES.
__label__Position	by just making the section smaller and have trasparency with dooing so
__label__Attack	I can't see how this would work, it would still happen regardless of the size of the comments senction
__label__Support	have profiles that are always flagged totally blocked
__label__Position	newspaper should allow only be printing/posting the facts and the comments sections should be free of any opinion even hate. but the community of users should be able to upvote/downvote their posts.
__label__Position	I don't think newspapers, who have already seen their takings plummet in recent years due to everything moving online, will want to pay to employ moderators for their articles. They would need to have a pretty high number of mods in order to keep up as each newspaper carries so many articles. This topic is a massive minefield and I don't think there is a simple solution to it.
__label__Position	Unfortunately, hate speech isn't illegal and despite parliament trying to pass a law on this, it is difficult to balance freedom of speech and the right to be protected from hate crime. (https://www.report-it.org.uk/reporting_internet_hate_crime) However, because of this I think it is extremely important to moderate these comment sections, muting certain words and phrases to make sure that there is a balance of free speech without allowing people to needlessly offend certain people or groups.
__label__Position	Some newspaper websites make it difficult to find the comments section to reduce the risk of hate speech. I had difficulty finding the comment section on the sun: https://www.thesun.co.uk/ and this may be because it is one of the more controversial newspapers and therefore they expect hate speech so hide the comment section well.

__label__Position	Violence attributed to online hate speech has increased (https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons) so this question needs to be answered with increasing demand. Policies to reduce hate speech is ever non-existent or inconsistently enforced. (https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons) Therefore, I think it's importnant for newspaper platforms to take this responsibility under their own wing. By providing these platforms I believe it is their responsibility to moderate them.
__label__Position	IT IS IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE WHO READ NEWSPAPERS TO FEEL SAFE AND FREE WHEN THEY READ NEWSPAPERS.SOME WEBSITES OR NEWSPAPERS DONT ALLOW PEOPLE TO VOICE OUT THEIR FEELINGS OR COMMENTS AND THAT SHOULD BE IMPROVED.
__label__Position	Back in 2014 the Guardian wrote an article about this: https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation They said people feel being able to say what they want is their right, but they can be very harmful. They said: "In the absence of strict moderation, we’d be much better off without them." I do agree with this - we definitely can't have comments sections left with no moderation at all.
__label__Position	I feel it's important to have freedom of speech and to discuss news responsibly. However, of course there will always be people that use the platform for hate, for spam or just to cause trouble. These discussion columns should be well moderated to ensure no hate speech or other junk gets through.
__label__Position	you cant if you make it completely open, the only way to do it is to employ the services of a moderator and place a warning that hate speech will be removed and the poster banned
__label__Position	I think allowing people to comment should continue, and be moderated
__label__Position	a higher proportion of people on the website strongly agree with the views expressed, and the majority of views expressed are in favour of allowing it to continue, however it is only a small majority and not significant.

__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Support	I agree freedom of speech is important but hate speech should not be allowed
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Support	It may prevent multiples accounts from one user
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	It may lead to an underground subculture or racists, homophobes who avoid this format
__label__Attack	Would make less people with no intention of harmful comments interact as they will be fearful of giving out personal data.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	It is true, there is freedom of speech, all readers should be able comment on what they think
__label__Support	This would reduce comments that may be derogatory and or offensive and in some cases discriminatory.
__label__Position	Have them reviewed after they are posted and do not allow them to be viewed before they are revied, as well as keeping tabs on the user posting the comments.
__label__Support	This would set the tone on the level of maturity that is required for the targeted group.
__label__Position	I think that any 'contributors' should have a profile and should not be allowed to use an alias. I also think that there should be moderators looking at every post before it is published online.
__label__Support	Moderators will allow for fair reviiews
__label__Position	Have an automated word elimination that will detect words that promote hate speech and not allow them to be posted.
__label__Position	Not allowing anonymous posts as well would force individuals to process comments internally before publishing on a public platform.
__label__Position	Be more strict when allowing people to create profiles, that require identification before allowing anybody to comment. Stopping people being anonymous enough to feel confident while posting hate speech I think will be more beneficial than restricting peoples comments.
__label__Attack	This may end up filtering out individuals with valid opinions that just feel safer commenting anonymously.
__label__Attack	This may
__label__Attack	This may filter out individuals with valid opinions who just don't feel comfortable without commenting with a degree of anonymitiy
__label__Position	They could force users to login and even if they chose to post annonymously, it can be flagged for hate speech and they can be banned from using the platform again.
__label__Attack	Crimes are often blamed on Gypsies in thge Uk but they are referred to wusing other terms. Eg people who tarmac your drive and other stereotyped roles
__label__Position	Hate speech is offensive and oftentimes discriminating. Adding the unique profile capacity, keyword identification, a way to report a comment and even moderators can have a good effect. Regarding what to consider hate speech, I would start with criminalized actions, such as racism, homophobia and anti-semitism.
__label__Position	Whilst there are arguments for and against the unrestricted use of comment sections, I still feel that newspapers should retain them. They are a vital way for readers to participate in the discussion/debate. The use of user profiles (prohibition of aliases) and clear warnings that unlawful hate speech will not be published AND result in readers being unable to make any future contributions might be worth consideration
__label__Attack	Not allowing them to be anynymous might probably discourage some good-intentioned people to comment as well.
__label__Attack	By opening a comment section and allowing anyone to express themselves there, holding the newspaper's website accountable for someone's comment seems a bit too much.
__label__Support	This may be the route to take as websites would not loosely hide behind "views expressed by the public on our websites do not represent our beliefs and values etc" statements. They would implement stringent measures of selection.
__label__Position	Have them reviewed after they are posted and do not allow them to be viewed before they are reviewed. Maybe also have an alogorithim that has key words that it seeks and when it finds them flags the comment for review.
__label__Support	Newspapers should remember they is freedom of speech
__label__Support	Hate speach and racism could be dealt with and in time persecuted
__label__Attack	Less people sign up for account
__label__Support	Online would be a nicer place
__label__Position	I agree, People will just add comments to anything these days, with no real knowledge of the subject.
__label__Position	I'm not sure we can ever do this, although I agree it needs to be done. Maybe if people had to comment under their real names all the time and not use "usernames", they wouldn't be so quick to do it.

__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it.

__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Freedom of speech does exist, and every user has the right to say what they wish. Where is the line drawn in regard to this discriminatory content?

__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Support	Exactly correct, there's no evidence to show removal or prohibition of user commentary actually reduces hate speech. Users simply find alternative means to express their thoughts. If you're aware of the popular meme 'in minecraft' illustrates this principle in its rudimentary form.
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Support	Free speech should never be curtailed. But how due you suggest you address the root cause of the problem?
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments

__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Attack	writers will not know how the reader feels
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__Position	I think they should pick up certain words or those that reflect hate speech in it's contect before being submitted.
__label__Position	By restricting hateful comments and blocking them from the site.
__label__Position	Use keyword decipher software and refer to a human rather than rely on AI.
__label__Support	I agree, cancelling opinions is reducing free speech, but there needs to be a bar to which all comments are moderated and allowed/prohibited.
__label__Position	In addition to reducing hate speech by site moderation community moderation could also take place having the ability to flag a post for the attention of moderators which violates terms of service.
__label__Position	Cancelling the comment section entirely infringes free speech, rather have a an option for people to report comment which they feel like are hate speech and have a team to review those comments and if a person has been reported for more than 3 times, they should be blocked from commenting in future posts.
__label__Position	we can reduce hate speech by blocking out certain words so that it can not be viewed publicly. and blocking the user using hate speech
__label__Support	I agree that comments should filtered
__label__Support	i agree
__label__Position	Newspaper websites can eliminate space for readers comments for articles that they think are more likely to receive more hate speech
__label__Attack	What you are suggesting means that free speech should be limited to those articles that won't generate a conversation. If you look at https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/10/news-sites-that-turn-off-commenting-dont-drive-users-to-social-media-instead/ it shows that restricting or reducing comments can inflame a situation and cause irrational and trolling.
__label__Position	People have a right to free speech and the responsibility to ensure that their views do not violate anyone's right (https://www.fordfoundation.org/news-and-stories/big-ideas/with-four-freedoms-four-responsibilities/with-the-freedom-of-speech-the-responsibility-to-listen/), therefore blocking anyone who doesn't use their right to free speech responsibly shouldn't be a problem
__label__Position	i still think information should be screened before it should post it. hate speech and its effects are not worth the risk, but people should be allowed free speech so it would be unfair to remove comment sections completely
__label__Support	https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/combat-online-hate-speech/
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Support	i dont agree, this would mean fake news could be posted unchallenged, perhaps it would be better for individuals comments to be screened by the company (so one company is not dealing with loads) before being posted
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Problem being, who gets to decide what hate speech actually is? It's all very well claiming hate speech at the drop of at hat but often it may be perceived as escalationary and over reactivity particularly to the level of juvenilty online discussion sometimes goes. I mean fine the web site providers are free to use their own discernment and reasonably can determine what does or doesn't feature on their website but that is not really conducive to cultivation an active user base.
__label__Attack	hate speech will take over the comment section. it is as the website owner to instate policies.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Support	Galliah, Shelly A would seem to agree
__label__Attack	This would then stop freedom of speech
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	some people may have different ideas for regulation
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Position	preventing certain words being able to be used, filtering words
__label__Position	We can fairly reduce hate speech in both newspapers and comments by educating on the origins and pains behind comments and by filtering certain words
__label__Support	I totally agree with you
__label__Position	I see two solutions to reduce hate speech from newspapers websites. First, websites can have moderators to filter what is considered as being "hate speech" and what's is a useful comment (giving an opinion about something without any hate, insults, etc.)
__label__Position	A person who post about hate speech should be either be given a warning but if he/she continues then that person will have to be suspended or removed from that curtain website/platform
__label__Attack	That's a good speech! Unfortunately, in the real world, that doesn't work. For the most part, people that comments on newspapers websites are adults (or late teens) and already got an education. And yes, for the most part, it'll be enough, they have good values and know how to share ideas without hate. But for some, it's not the case...
__label__Attack	Unfortunately people will always exist that are hateful
__label__Attack	User flagging would be perfect and yes modaretors but they won't be available all the time
__label__Support	I agree, education is the best way in stopping this in the future https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/impact-and-prevention/preventive-role-of-education
__label__Attack	That would be very helpful
__label__Support	i agree, this would be useful as it can keep other comments
__label__Position	My final argument is that it is possible to monitor and reduce hate speech on website comments by using both AI and human intelligence
__label__Support	this could be done by filtering terms
__label__Position	Filter the comments and leave the positive ones.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	i agree that sometimes criticism isn't always bad, especially if the article is unfair as they regularly are
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	I think that every platform (websites, socials, etc.) have the responsability to filter and regulate what's happening on their platform.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.

__label__Support	But also... an open comment section provides these individuals with a platform and instead of the desired open communication to educate people, it can be that more people become radicalised.

__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	Proper moderation that does not tolerate racist, sexist or any other discriminating behavior or hate speech.
__label__Position	Proper moderation that does not tolerate racist, sexist or any other discriminating behavior or hate speech.
__label__Position	Free speech is important to provide an opportunity for everyone to examine an issue from many perspectives. I like the idea of moderators and/or approved profiles of contributors to the discussion to enable a discussion free of hate.
__label__Position	While I support open discussion, I also think that thorough moderation is difficult. Do you rely solely on humans or do you use some type of software? How do you define hate speech on your platform? And what when open discussion turns into an additional platform for these hateful messages? I think there is still a lot to talk about- but again, I agree that banning commenting overall (and openly with a portion of accountability attached to it) is not the solution.
__label__Position	You can not, everybody should be able to make comments you can't shut yourself off from society.
__label__Support	I agree on the usefulness of a report button.
__label__Attack	But software is not near good enough to accurately identify hate speech all the time. Language is complex and you can't pin HS through banning or flagging certain terms and phrases only.
__label__Attack	I Disagree, modern software technology is capable of knowing when to filter out post being made by the public. A system can be integrated as too where if a post achieves a certain threshold of flagged/reported tickets; there post would and can be immediately shut down.
__label__Position	Free speech is not hate speech. The ability to express an opposing opinion without inciting violence or descrimination should be a basic communication skill that must be met before an opinion is published.
__label__Position	I know this has been discussed a few times potentially in reply to comments but I'd like to repeat it again: language is complex and you can't simply ban or flag certain terms or phrases and think you catch all the hate speech comments etc. While a report button and the use of a software that can support a human moderator is in essence a good idea, it might also delete comments that do not actually contain HS or completely miss others overall. I think this decision by the newspaper turned into an entire discussion of manageability of monitoring discussion sections and away from the ethical considerations.
__label__Attack	Ai could be used to flag, but then an experienced arbitrator is needed to decide if item removed
__label__Position	Hate speech vs Free Speech Tam (2017), the justices unanimously reaffirmed that there is effectively no "hate speech" exception to the free speech rights protected by the First Amendment and that the U.S. government may not discriminate against speech on the basis of the speaker's viewpoint.
__label__Position	Important to balance free speech with the rights of the individual and groups. A problem is that hate speech is often subjective, and debate is needed to explore the real underlying issue. Currently a lot og groups cry hate speech when it is just a different opinion or badly expressed point with no hate intended.

__label__Position	The Newspaper websites should create an AI software so it can be able to detect negative responses and should be flagged as red flag and then disable those comments from being posted to the public. I think that would help instead of someone reading through the comments one by one which would take time to do.
__label__Position	Remove the comment section on the websites, the news are meant to be read and nothing can be changed on the statements given on the news.

__label__Attack	What are the root causes?
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Attack	freedom of speech should be allowed anywhere
__label__Support	maybe fake news will be reduced in this way
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

__label__Attack	I do believe that removing the comment section is the right thing to do. even though some may see it as restricting free speech
__label__Support	Removing this option would not allow those who make negative comments ritually
__label__Support	Although i understand why limiting comments would reduce hate speech, unfortunately it then plays to the smaller group in society that causes the problems. The majority of people can have a great debate without taking to name calling etc

__label__Support	There's other spaces for online discussion (eg Reddit or Facebook). Newspapers seem to only have online comments sections in order to capture readers and keep them on their site.
__label__Position	Through active moderation.
__label__Support	Anything that helps cut back on the often nasty diatribes that appear on comments sections, can only be a good thing.
__label__Position	Regulation of the newspaper comment section should be done. There should be moderators who have the ability to remove certain comments if they feel it is needed.
__label__Support	Human moderators can make good measured contributions and decisions about whether content is ok or not. Ultimately its the newspaper that decides what content it hosts on its website.
__label__Position	Better moderation, and less promotion of comments that make outlandish and inflammatory statements.
__label__Position	Rules still need to be made and active moderation should also occur but. a lack of comment section can also reduce space for fake news. However, newspapers also post fake news sometimes so the comment section can allow people to reflect on this.
__label__Position	This is not fair as it infringes with the freedom of speech and could have negative outcome. The best way to goabout this is to have a policy to approve comments before they are posted
__label__Position	the newspaper websites should have a moderator who has to approve or an algorithm that would check any comment before it is posted should make sure it does not inclue any hate speech

__label__Position	they would need to have a moderator or an algorithm that checks the comments for any hate speech and remove or not post it from their page.

__label__Position	https://www.sanews.gov.za/south-africa/hate-speech-bill-will-assist-fight-against-racism
__label__Attack	Removing the platform is a preferable one
__label__Position	The pros are that it would lead to less people responding to comments negatively
__label__Position	I believe that completing removing the comments section is not the answer, but I do think they should be more moderated so those types of comments are deleted.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks.

__label__Support	I agree
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	I agree with this, it should be encouraged especially around political/social issues but moderation is definitely key
__label__Support	This is true, I feel that most people do not understand how much hate speech may affect one, despite it not affecting them before in their lives itself!
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.

__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	I think my idea is good
__label__Support	I think my idea is very good
__label__Attack	How can we draw the fine line between hate speech and freedom of speech?
__label__Position	If comments that create hate speech are removed/moderated, you can not complain about loss of freedom of speech as you are then being discrimantory, rather than speaking freely, and there is a difference.
__label__Support	True
__label__Position	Overall I think I agree with some of the mentions that removing the comments section does reduce freedom of speech. We should be allowed to comment and share opinions on any topic as long as it isn't hate speech.
__label__Position	I believe that encouraging participation in social discussion is vital to encourage informative arguments and learning, but the moderation of these spaces is key. There needs to be a constant check over the content to ensure no hate speech is occuring. An AI system could do some of this work but may miss nuances. If there is a real problem reoccuring then the newspaper could only allow people to comment if they have created an account so that these people could then be blocked if they breach the rules. In my opinion it is not fair to remove the comment space altogether but there has to be a balance.
__label__Position	This can be done through lectures and youtube videos highlighting how moderators should approach those committing hate speech. It can also be done by teaching what hate speech itself actualy is, and how it affects people.
__label__Position	Remove anonymity. Perhaps contributors should be required to join sites giving some checkable background information. This can be helpful if there is a brief CV so that one can see the perspective of the contributor. There shouldn't be any need to reduce space for comments, just the need for moderation. In the UK we are used to the idea of newspapers having political preferences, so when approaching a discussion site one might have an idea of its political identity and preference.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.

__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments

__label__Support	to make everyone fairly represented to make sure
__label__Position	I THINK IT WORKS BETTER IF WE COMBINE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND HUMAN INTELLIGENCE SO THAT WE GET A POSITIVE BALANCE WITHOUT CAUSING ANY INCONVENIENCES.
__label__Position	There should be no comment section however a robust system with an ombudsman should be put in place. Most importantly articles should be fact based information and not opinion based speculation.
__label__Position	Limiting the algorithms push to only show negative or controversial viewpoints would go a long way to decreasing the hate comments.
__label__Position	people must change, not internet/website
__label__Position	to appoint a panel from different backgrounds to review comments
__label__Position	The question assumes that we CAN fairly reduce hate (or any other) genre of speech when this generally has been shown to be impossible without heavy moderation and/or dramatically impacting interaction, as evidenced by any major social media platform I can think of. Algorithms used in places like wikipedia, twitter and reddit are probably an effective and fairly simple option, where a combination of akismet style selection and a robust anaylsis and transparency are available to see if and when someones history has bias.
__label__Support	this will reduce cyberbullying
__label__Position	I've been asked to summarise my position after carefully considering everyone elses viewpoints but most of the positions I've read are opinions on whether it should be done rather than how so I'm not sure how I'm supposed to address this.
__label__Position	from newspaper websites in a minimal manner that doesn't potentially compromise outside factors mentioned above.
__label__Position	Like I mentioned previously,the need for artificial intelligence is vital and like what AliceW mentioned in hjer post that people needs to be educated about hate speech which I strongly support.I also think it is everyone's responsibility to educate each other the damage hate speech has to individuals and the society at large
__label__Attack	I don't think most people would take the time to educate each other about hate speech, and I assume there will be stubborn people that are stuck in their ways and will continue to comment their hateful opinions.
__label__Position	It still seems important to focus more on reporting the news and far less on giving a newspapers opinion of the news. But straight news doesn't make the clicks or the money. Looking at the current changes to CNN are a good indication that anger sells and straight news does not.The anger is what keeps the comments sections alive.
__label__Position	Alternatively I'd offer the opinion that goes against the question and states that we shouldn't offer a space for readers comments (and thus hate speech) at all on news since it's primarily a site and source for news. Systems like https://ground.news/ have been providing news and removing bias without a social aspect already and since third party social/sharing/commentary sites handle discussion and the problem of hate speech far better than newspaper websites presumably can hope to, the solution seems intuitive: remove it and let that happen organically on other websites and platforms.
__label__Position	We can fairly reduce hate speech by stating clear rules and explanation around what hate speech means and then stating the consequences for breaking these rules.
__label__Position	Comment boxes should not be deleted. As discussed in the Times (https://time.com/5770755/threat-free-speech-online/) it's difficult to say whether responsibility for hate speech posted is on the newespaper or individual people.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Attack	Yes... reducing of hate speech is not
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Attack	Comment section is a space where we learn from each other, and we can disagree but need to eliminate hate speech.
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	Sadly not everyone can be polite enough to express themselves without the use of hate speech, hence such people should be blocked as we cannot tolerate it.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	It helps other people contribute their feelings
__label__Support	hate speech can be aggressive
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Support	Freedom of speech is significant and readers must be able to express themselves negative or positive it is their right. Hence the need to keep the comment section but flagging or blocking users who make use of hate speech is a fair action to take.
__label__Support	Removing comment sections on newspapers, enables limited misinformation and discrimination to reproduce.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Support	Prevents fake news
__label__Attack	Simultaneously limits freedom of opinion. A censored comment section can hinder thought-provoking discussions
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	That could help, although that would take a long of time. Also at the end of the day, whoever writes hateful speech do not see the dangers of what they are doing. According to an article in The Guardian, some people think this is just the internet and it does not reflect true life.
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Support	How will we know how the public feels about about a certain topic if they cant even give their opinions? I do not think this is fair. At least appropriate measures can be taken in order to stop hate speech.
__label__Attack	How do people exercise freedom of speech?
__label__Position	Moderation of certain topics should be enforced, while still allowing space for readers for comments. I believe that there are points that can be drawn from a comment that offers another perspective, given the point is made without ill intent. That is why I believe moderation with certain guidelines that are made public listed.
__label__Attack	people need to be nicer online
__label__Support	i agree that if people are going to use social media they need to expect hate
__label__Position	Removing hate speech comments before publishing them. remove peple who post hate speech
__label__Position	The comments could be checked for hateful speech. For example, there could be a bot or something (I do not know the exact name) that checks for any hateful words and eliminate that comment.
__label__Support	I share the same opinion on that having a bot that can check for hate speech is the way either block users who use hate speech or put them on time out.
__label__Position	In many ways, the debates confronting courts, legislatures, and publics about how to reconcile the competing values of free expression and nondiscrimination have been around for a century or longer. Democracies have varied in their philosophical approaches to these questions, as rapidly changing communications technologies have raised technical challenges of monitoring and responding to incitement and dangerous disinformation.
__label__Position	I think newspapers websites should have an online system that can detect hate speech and block users that use this kind of language but keeping it open for negative or positive feedback would be fair but not giving readers the freedom to use hate speech.
__label__Support	I completely agree, it will help avoid people posting offensive comments and allow the comment section space to be a space of productiveness where we learn what our fellow communities think about articles posted
__label__Support	Becauce we are different as peole we find some views offensive
__label__Position	Conversations should be welcomed, but only under the supervision of moderators who constantly watch for and control any disruptive or destructive comments.
__label__Position	Although it would be fair to allow for both critical and positive input, I believe that newspaper websites should have a mechanism in place that can identify hate speech and restrict individuals who use it. This would prevent readers from freely using hate speech.
__label__Position	The notion of moderators are useless. Let me remind you about how Suckerberg was questioned about his fact checkers. Also who fact checks the fact checkers?
__label__Position	https://www.discoursemagazine.com/ideas/2022/03/08/the-fifth-wave-who-fact-checks-the-fact-checkers/
__label__Position	There should be a policy that reflects upon hate speech. Such hateful comments should be deleted. The policy would have to have all hateful language covered. According to an article in Media engagement, research in mentioned countries was done and most people preferred that hateful speech comments should be deleted rather than profanity.
__label__Attack	Individual currators personal bias
__label__Support	Avoids AI filtering out free speech
__label__Position	The implementation of polices to regulate any form of discriminatory or hateful comments, while allowing space for readers to express opinions is necessary. As it is through uncensored opinions that conversations begins and transform into real issues. There definitely needs to be a 'blocking users' feature and censors on profanity. However, a very restricted comments section can cause misrepresented news websites to spread their biased perspective without being challenged by the public.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Attack	Much as I agree that's probably ideal as far as not requiring constant monitoring of the sort that's only really feasible for a relatively small amount of newer articles, the kind of technology for properly filtering such things isn't quite there yet, beyond simply checking for specific language. ...and it's worth noting, even if it was, whoever writes the algorithm also decides what is worthy of being removed. Being able to cull commentary automatically this way is potentially even more damaging if your concern is freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Support	everyone has the right to be heard
__label__Attack	hate speech can not be given opportunity to thrive and or be heard. it should be removed the moment it is made
__label__Attack	But what if the opinion of others infringes upon the rights of another. As much as we should all be able to express our opinion it shouldn't be at the expense of others.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	Too big a problem to deal with
__label__Attack	i dont think its possible to weigh hate speech. different peech hits differently to different people
__label__Attack	it has to be completely restricted
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Attack	newspapers should remain impartial and hate speech leans on an opinion.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Attack	people will not be able to voice out their opinions and views openly
__label__Attack	thats the bad outake as they will sell the information they want without any way for it to be debated
__label__Support	agreed. no one body/company should be given that much power. dialogue and transparency is the cornerstone of any democracy
__label__Attack	newspapers cover opinions that fit with their narrative so you cannot say that they don't portray a one sided profile
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Attack	a lot of people, especially the older generation, rely on newspapers in order to be exposed to current affairs
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	comments can be screened before they are posted live on the platform so they can be filtered.
__label__Position	human mods and word filters
__label__Position	the code could be written to exclude certain offensive words. comments including those words could be prevented from being posted
__label__Attack	this is a great way to monitor
__label__Attack	the mod can even alert the authorities should they feel the hate speech warrants law enforcements
__label__Attack	the mods could be outweighed due to the content volume
__label__Position	People who pass hate comments should be given time off the app to reflect or rather banned from making further comments under that specific post
__label__Support	Agreed, there's needs to be stronger consequences for those sharing hate speech. Those behind accounts which troll and leave horrific content should be banned and the ip address blocked.
__label__Position	Most realistically, you ought to have comment spaces moderated while the article is ongoing and then lock them after a certain amount of time has passed - or when meaningful discussion naturally draws to close. That gives a balance between being able to like...actually keep an eye on what people are saying without having to monitor everything you put up constantly. On the same front, creating aggregate comment spaces for a specific topic rather than one for every article could also potentially reduce the amount of areas necessary to be moderated, and accordingly allow for a higher quality of moderation that could curb the impacts of these behaviours.
__label__Position	I do feel that trolls are worse as they know there is no accountability for them as they can just set up fake accounts. If ID was required to create accounts, people wouldn't be so quick to post hateful content.
__label__Position	no democratic society can thrive by wholly suppressing the voices of those who are involved in the decision making processes of the government. I firmly stand behind the argument that the comment space should remain but I also believe that these news houses and government, need to be more proactive in educating people about important and pressing topics, rather than preventing them from doing so completely. In as much as words/opinions can be harmful, they can also be helpful .https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech . the attached article supports this notion. I also say that the best deterrence method is sanctions. people tend to rethink/reconsider their decisions when they evaluate what the outcome/punishment could potentially be. whole purposes of newspaper is educate and inform, that in itself requires dialogue. when this is eliminated you run the risk of giving one outlet the benefit of writing what ever they choose without the possibility of them being checked.
__label__Position	If we are to ban everyone who post a hateful comment we would be infringing on their basic right of freedom of speech. But the question still remains, when is it just a hateful comment and not hatred or propaganda. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression in press and other media. To some extent we dont have a right to block them from expressing their thoughts
__label__Support	Passing hateful speeches is not basic right of freedom of speech, rather you are checking how peoples comment could affect society. People need to be banned and removed from passing those comments to put positive energy on media platforms.
__label__Position	To fairly reduce hate speech will be helping people from cyberbullying which may continue to increase the ideology of having media as a safe space

__label__Position	restrictions on hateful speech undermines democratic legitimac of a state. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11158-019-09431-6
__label__Position	A person should be able to intelligently share their opinion across without hate speech in public forums. There should be some sort of censorship algorithm m that filters out comments that include de hate speech.
__label__Position	I believe that completely removing comments does remove a reader's write to share their opinions and thoughts but i also believe that there is an appropriate way to share opinions across. Hate speech does not allow for healthy and constructive conversations.
__label__Support	Although people might abuse the flagging, however, if there are reviewers to do their work on those flags, these comments that have been flagged intentionally would not be removed.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.

__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Attack	It is one way or the other their responsibility to police it, because it is their platform the hate speech is taken place and they would be the first point to check that and eliminate those speeches.

__label__Support	i think this would be a good thing and i totally agree - free speech without hate should be and is possible.
__label__Support	yes indeed we have to check the root cause analysis
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments

__label__Support	It is a good idea to not completely remove comment sections as that discourages user interaction
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	That seems very authoritative and draconic.
__label__Position	i think people need to be educated better about what Hate Speech is.
__label__Position	I think all the hate speech my be removed before it is published on public
__label__Attack	i think more moderators are needed for this - and i don't think it means we live in a nanny state as i'm sure others will say.
__label__Position	Flag known and "popular" derogatory terms automatically through the platform which does not allow you to post the comment without using the politically correct terms
__label__Support	Agree- though there should also be some information provided as to why a comment has been deleted. For example, if someone uses a racial slur, they could be educated on why others may find it offensive. Rather than just blocking the comment.
__label__Position	People can comment on other websites. They do not need to provide a comment platform on the same page. Or the newspaper can provide a forum.
__label__Position	There must be a tool that detects hate speech on the websites
__label__Position	United Nations website has some useful information regarding hate speech (https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/take-action/engage). I think a lot of this boils down to educating people and understanding how these issues can be tackled.
__label__Position	tests and trials should be conducted to collect data on user reaction to hate speech
__label__Position	human rights of the masses should not be violated regardless of their beliefs and views
__label__Position	The most surprising position was to completely eliminate the comments section. various studies have been conducted in this regard and they all agree on one thing and that deleting comments is not a good idea and can damage the general perception of the outlet. https://mediaengagement.org/research/how-the-public-views-deletion-of-offensive-comments/
__label__Support	There shoudl be freedom of speech, everyone can judge by themselves
__label__Position	https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/19/npr-comments-decision-guardian-readers

__label__Attack	Censorhip feeld liek democraic values of freedom are abolished nad can lead to precedent of media muffling public opinion as they deem fit
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Who determines what is and isnt hate speech?
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	Freedom of speech does not include hate speech.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Support	Yes, freedom of speech is very important in this day and age.
__label__Support	This is a great idea.
__label__Attack	In addition to using algorithms, technology can be used to eliminate comments that involve hate speech for reader inclusivity. I definitely agree to this. Everyone has a freedom of speech, but it should infringe the rights of others too.
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Support	Well said.
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	But how would one be able to determine what is hate speech and what isn’t? For example someone could say the word n*gger in context of a historical discussion. Some black people would consider it hate speech and others wouldn’t. With people deciding what is and what isn’t hate speech with their subjective opinions, genuine non-hatefuelled opinions would not be posted and as a result this method would inhibit free speech unfairly to some degree.
__label__Position	we could filter the comments and have a panel to decide
__label__Attack	The panel would be biased in some way no matter how much the newspaper tries to remove bias.
__label__Position	I disagree. Comments might be useful for users and also the owners of the newspapers. Though, asking people to identify themselves when registering could help reduce hate speech, as people would not be able to do whatever they want anonymously.
__label__Support	I agree with this sentiment as people will be more conscious of their opinions.
__label__Position	I think it is important to reduce hate speech. However, it is equally important to uphold the right to freedom of speech and to encourage healthy discussion as this is how people learn/grow. Thus, as another user commented I think there should be dedicated people who monitor the comment section and ban/limit the offending commenters.
__label__Position	While I think it's important to reduce hate speech in the comment sections, the question is how, without restricting people to have freedom of speech. In addition, I also think it's important that there are people who monitor and give permission/accept the comment added after it has been observed, while providing reminders on the newspaper sections that comments should be clean, friendly and not rude for reader sensitivity.
__label__Support	I agree. Just moderate the comment sections a bit more.
__label__Position	Abolishing the comment section is not the way forward. I think asking commenters for their personal details would also be a breach of the GDPR and may complicate matters for the newspaper. I think there should be some sort of screening that flags up problematic comments.
__label__Position	Generally, most users agree that removing the comment spaces will likely affect free speech. I have agreed with this reasoning in my previous comment. There are some users who believe that the hate speech problem can also be solved through systems like algorithms and monitoring devices that identify hate speech. I think this is a great idea. Not only does it retain free speech in this regard, but it wll possibly deter future hate speech comments.
__label__Position	Hate speech should not be allowed to dominate the narrative as it defeats the process and hinders effective communication. As a result, flagging and blocking of problematic accounts can prove to be effective in combating the spread of hate speech.
__label__Attack	I disagree. Democracy cannot progress if others are punished for the misdeeds of a few people. A headache simply will not be solved by cutting the head off. Other devices such as comment monitoring and elimination can prove useful.
__label__Position	Someone mentioned in this site that although freedom of speech is given to everyone, an algorithm should be in place to eliminate comments including hate speech in the newspaper where everyone is reading the newspaper. It would be unfair that the people are reading and for them to be reading rude and foul comments.
__label__Position	According to the United Nations, we all have roles to play in reducing hate speech. Among the suggested ways, I want to highlight fact-checking and education. When everyone begins to fact-check, it becomes easier to identify internet trolls and harbourers of bad intentions. Another great way is education. We must continually educate ourselves and those around us on the negative effects of hate speech. via https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/take-action/engage

__label__Position	Ban certain phrases from being used
__label__Position	I agree that moderators can be useful, but they will probably be young people who are seemingly offended by everything and yet claim to be tolerant.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	I agree with the statement, however in this article https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea they speak about different countries laws and UN laws. The difficulties in combatting hate speech on such a universal level is there is not a solid agreement from the world on what constitutes hate speech and how to combat it.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Support	I completely agree with this. This will make an open space for people to leave their comments but also make sure that everything is checked before its posted.
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	I think newspapers websites should introduce a bot that would delete automatically all posts that have too many hate words in it.
__label__Attack	An improvement on this would be to have a flagged comment be reviewed by a moderator rather than just delete a comment altogether.
__label__Position	We can eliminate hate speech by allowing proper and thorough covering of every story. Often these articles are inaccurate or have a hidden agenda which makes the readers angry about the misinformation. Education about ways of proper communication without use of violence online would also reduce the amount of hate.
__label__Position	free speech is important and we should be giving people the opportunity to be giving their opinions, I don't think that eliminating a comment section would help with to eliminate hate speech, people will just go else where with their speech, what we should we should have is a moderated comment section, peoples posts can then be moderated before it's aloud on the platform and of course there should be a report button so anything that does get through can then be reported
__label__Attack	yes, the lack of consequences is the problem. We can see from somewhere like facebook where peoples info is so easy to find that people have had negative consequences over their hateful posts so clearly being able to link back the comment to the person can help
__label__Position	By not providing comment section not unless the article need their opinion. There'll be a note notifying readers to be well mannered.
__label__Support	I think having the viewer agree to use respectful language before they are taken to the comment section could have some minor benefits.
__label__Support	I agree that most if not all online news articles do not need a comments section. However, I believe having a note to tell readers to be well mannered would not stop readers from posting hate speech if they had intended to do so in the first place.
__label__Position	people feel powerful behind an anonymous account, its easier to say things you would never normally say under the guise of anonymity, if it was easier to link a comment to who it came from and if people actually faced consequences from posting hate then this could help stop it.
__label__Support	I completely agree with this. Instead of removing and upsetting people and removing their right to speak just bring in the moderators and then this way people can still comment and then there would be less hate speech
__label__Position	Another interesting article - focusing on some original research about comment on Huffington Post articles. The researchers tested three different scenarios - (1) where commenters could easily set up multiple accounts; (2) where commenters had to authenticate their account (via Facebook) but didn't have to use their own names; (3) where commenting was outsourced to Facebook, so any comment made could be seen by the commenters friends and family. Surprisingly, it was the second scenario which had the best outcome - i.e. the comments were less weary and had more 'cognitive complexity'. It suggests you don't actually have to reveal your own personal details to everyone online, to create the safest kind of commenting environment; but that people should be required to create a stable identity. https://theconversation.com/online-anonymity-study-found-stable-pseudonyms-created-a-more-civil-environment-than-real-user-names-171374
__label__Position	Readers that feel the need to put hate speech in comment section only do so because of the way they can remain anonymous online. In everyday life you could go months and if not years without hearing hate speech, whilst it can almost be a daily occurrence when browsing online in various forums, social media platforms or comment sections on news websites. Finding a way for readers/users not to remain anonymous and having real consequences for spreading hate speech would reduce this issue.
__label__Position	In the EU we have a Code of Conduct, to prevent and counter the spread of illegal hate speech online, in2016, the Commission agreed with several social media platforms a code of conduct on countering illegal hate speech online. I think the companies should be the ones responsible for removing the hate speech on their platforms and should have consequences if they do not. This has been proven to improve the removal of hate speech. According to https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/combatting-discrimination/racism-and-xenophobia/eu-code-conduct-countering-illegal-hate-speech-online_en "the last evaluation shows that on average the companies are now assessing 81% of flagged content within 24 hours and 62.5% of the content deemed illegal hate speech is removed."
__label__Position	I agree that moderating the comment section with flagged phrases that automatically send comments for quick moeration would be a good solution.
__label__Position	I consider it important to allow debate to be open, there must be a better way to reduce or eliminate hate from comment space than getting rid of them. Doing so would allow no one to question opinion pieces they didn't agree with.
__label__Position	Newspapers and free speech functioned well for a couple of hundred years without instant comments. People used to write letters to the newspaper, including their name. The newspaper would then publish some letters anonymously. This meant that people were protected but offered well considered opinions, rather than abusive or nasty comments. Perhaps a slower postal system encourages better behaviour rather than an amplified Twitter-esque school-yard of bullying and abuse.
__label__Position	Any "hate" speech not defined by the law, is not hate speech at all. It is just a form of words that other people choose to find offensive, based on their attitudes and beliefs.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted.

__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.

__label__Support	It has been suggested that hiding comments rather than removing them is the best way forward. Commenters don't like their posts to be deleted, understandably, and often feel censored which can cause them to lash out with further offensive comments. By hiding a comment, the original poster can still see it and may not realise that it has been hidden from others which minimises upset caused to others whilst preserving the original poster's involvement. https://blog.brandbastion.com/deleting-comments-can-trigger-backlash
__label__Support	I agree. And the majority of time people are not hateful or threatening. Those should be obvious enough to be simply removed/banned and everything else is fair game even if you dont like hearing it or dont agree its right/true etc
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments

__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Attack	I dont believe in censorship though. Commentary and opinions are important. We cannot say that just because some people might believe fake news we should only have one government authorized news source to protect people. People need to be less sensitive and also be aware enough to not take everything they read as being true.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.

__label__Attack	the public should be able to give their opinions, if you try and stop it they will always find a way to make their voice heard and this is when thigs could get nasty with hate speech.
__label__Position	by giving guide lines on the comment section
__label__Attack	Agree with your suggestions. I had the same idea. However, there would need to be a way to get around mispellings of words to get around the blocked vocabulary.
__label__Attack	I'm not sure if AI could function well enough at this time for this to be the final answer.
__label__Position	By flagging certain vocabulary which relates to hate speech and once this is flogged, the person commenting is blocked from posting their view. We would need to look at ways of getting around mispellings of the words though, as people could use this to get past the AI.
__label__Position	I'm a firm supporter of freedom of speech but the internet as we all know can be a cruel place. A lot of individuals hide behind their screens and say things to people that they wouldn't have the guts to say in person given the opportunity. So with that being said I stand for the elimination of the space bar for readers.
__label__Attack	The biggest problem that there is
__label__Position	I see that a lot wants to go the AI route. one or so are against it. Again, it is good to see the opinion of other people and how other people feel about an article, or news event. I do understand that there are people that abuse platforms for the sake of hate, but therefore I will agree with a NON bias panel that regulate the comments on a platform. AI is limited and we have seen on other platforms that it creates division when they start to mix in unwanted words or meddling with AI system to create a certain outcome. It is dangerous again and that is what is causing more hate, than a few that just use and abuse.
__label__Position	Hate speech should not be tolerated on any platform. But in reality we are never going to completely get away from it. However we need to find ways of eliminating it as much as possible
__label__Position	The newspapers can disable the comment space when they believe that a specific article may result in some discrimination. They could also monitor the comment section and delete comments that may be offensive.
__label__Position	Please read this article - https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/11/30/how-online-hate-speech-is-fueling-real-life-violence/
__label__Attack	The problem is that hate speech laws differ from country to country. The UN has a set of rules (https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech?gclid=Cj0KCQjw48OaBhDWARIsAMd966B8prXQ12vsyA9iPNzeoJiBpSFAuLJFh4j4_h5QJe48gd8MVKZ4eHQaAiPWEALw_wcB) but that does not mean all countries obey and follow them. Taking away opinion from topics would mean you would not know how other feel about an topic or article all in the name of hate speech. Therefore, it would create a miss understood society.
__label__Position	Hiring moderators
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	I agree, having it flagged and hidden until review is fair. If the comments section has clear rules then its easy to moderate if a comment broke them or not instead of it being subjective or based on opinion
__label__Support	one way would be to not let and comments be published until a moderator has checked each comment.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	I agree to some extent. I think there are some obvious exceptions but otherwise anytime someone disagrees they can say they find it offensive or hateful and want it removed. You can't exist in a happy thoughts only bubble
__label__Attack	people should be able to have an opinion, but without monitoring people would be offended all the time and thing could escalate very quickly.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Support	How will a newspaper manage to do this?
__label__Attack	does take a lot of work/ man power or bots which could over filter comment sections
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Attack	I think that once you go down the route of cancelling comments, you run the risk of an almost dictatorship position for the newspapers, to be able to say what they like with no comeback from anyone.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Attack	problem is, it's not children doing it, its people past general education and often adverse to adult learning full stop
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed

__label__Attack	This could be costly depending on how many articles there are to review
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	It can be done by using algorithms
__label__Support	Seems a cost efficient way.
__label__Position	It can be done by taking into consideration the feelings of the people who will get to read the newspaper. The person or persons that will be responsible in writing the newspaper must know what will and will not hurt the people who will be reading the newspaper.
__label__Position	It can be done by taking into consideration the feelings of the people who will get to read the newspaper. The person or persons that will be responsible in writing the newspaper must know what will and will not hurt the people who will be reading the newspaper.
__label__Position	I can be easily put in place with the system I already mentioned.
__label__Position	Freedom of speech should be allowed on the website but with clear guidelines. If someone breaks any rules, they will be blocked.
__label__Position	I think there should be red flagged or blacklisted words that shouldn't be allowed to be used in reader's comments. If a certain post contain such words, it should not be automatically exposed to other readers but should be reviewed first by the admin to check if it meets the standard before being exposed to everyone.
__label__Support	Yes, they can deeply hurt anyone's internal peace
__label__Position	If the comment section has hate comments, then the newspaper must cancel the comment section
__label__Position	One mainstream way of mitigating hate speech on online comment sections is to pre-moderate comments. This however may lead to a 'biased' viewpoint. A lighter example of this could be how some youtubers delete constructive criticism.
__label__Support	I agree!
__label__Position	Newspapers could censor certain words that are deemed hateful. This could be done automatically.
__label__Support	I would support this fully.
__label__Position	https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/553619/action-against-hate-easy-read-160916.pdf
__label__Position	Using a system that will block hate words is an option to address this issue. However the newspaper must be careful of not using the platform to block views that may differ from theirs.
__label__Position	moderating the comments
__label__Support	moderators can remove bad comments
__label__Support	it would definitely help to reduce hate speech and remove hateful language
__label__Position	By monitoring comments for hate speech and removing those comments rather than the whole section
__label__Position	I think it is important for people to be able to comment on newspapers websites, but I think there needs to be a way of moderating the comments section to prevent/remove hate speech.
__label__Support	Agreed
__label__Position	I don't agree with eliminating the space for comments because everyone has the right of free speech, however hate speech is a real issue that I think could be solved by simply moderating the comments section, using an algorithm to filter out insulting words.
__label__Position	Like one other commenter said, there's multiple ways of spreading hate speech other than newspapers websites, such as social media. I think every little bit helps when combating hate speech though, so moderating the comments section would make a diffference.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.

__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	But who defines what is 'hate' speech? People who share a different opinion to the author or another reader?
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	I feel like people's wellbeing should be the priority, and those targeted by hate speech might be gravely affected by commenter's words. To me this is more important than people's right to free speech.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Support	i agree, freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences and those who peddle hate speech should be punished
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Attack	Algorithm not always working
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Attack	Would that be enough?
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree with the sentiment but the use of the word "should" emphasises that some people are not able to practice respect and tolerance as a pre-requisite
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Support	I agree that many people have different platforms to air their opinions these days, in fact it is very easy to create fake identities, and posts.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	I disagree and believe that other views should be respected and be allowed to be aired. If we only read one particular newspaper then our view will become one sided, with a comments section arguing different points, then it opens us up to many other arguments.
__label__Position	Filter words so if a comment contains this word it will be reviewed as to if it is appropriate or automatically deleted
__label__Support	Firtly, i think the newpaper need to acknowledge the concern of hate speech. And is importnant because we can never fully avoid it. So the newspaper should have a platform support people who are targets of hate speech.
__label__Support	The newspaper should also boost positive messages of tolerance.
__label__Attack	This works in terms of removing literal slurs from the platform, but doesn't account for when hate speech is more well-disguised or nebulous - how could we expect an automatic system to understand a dogwhistle?
__label__Position	It seems this remains a diffcult question, with varying responses on the subject
__label__Support	Exactly
__label__Support	Less Issues with arguments and trolls
__label__Position	With rights comes responsibility. We all have freedom of speech but it is our responsibility to ensure that our speech does not cause harm on others. If people do not want to be responsible in their speech, then their speech should be reduced because things have consequences. So, the hate speech can be reduced from newspaper websites by removing comments with hate speech or having a software that can identify hate speech in a comment before it is posted.
__label__Position	Hate speech is something people intentionally and so if people continue to participate in it, they should be punished.
__label__Position	Everyone is entitled to freedom of speech but hate speech can be detrimental to readers and the topics mental health. I think the best way to deal with hate speech is to have filtered comments, raising awareness and age restrictions on wensites and comment sections
__label__Support	too many opinions can be conflicting
__label__Attack	The problem is that people can register an account giving false details, so how do we ensure they have given their correct age for example?
__label__Position	A system should be implemented in which hate speech can be detected. This can be done through filtering common hat speech phrases or words used. Furthermore, an option should be provided where readers can report hate speech and those who are responsible for the comment must take responsibility. Responsibility can range from being charged a fine, removing comments, or providing bans for a period of time and preventing them from commenting.
__label__Attack	No hiding behind false ID
__label__Support	Should reduce Trolls
__label__Support	I also believe that educating one another is very important in trying to reduce hate speech.
__label__Position	Currently, there is no concrete law that addresses or prevents hate speech. Sometimes the law may get involved if the hate speech is perceived as a genuine threat to harm, but most of the time there’s not a lot anyone can do legally. However, just because it isn’t technically considered a crime in the U.S., that doesn’t mean that hate speech doesn’t influence society. Some have argued that inflammatory public speech increases before outbreaks of mass violence, which could suggest that hate speech is a precursor or even a prerequisite for violence. There are some historical incidents that seem to suggest this is true. For example, prior to the Holocaust, Jews were commonly referred to as rats and vermin by the Nazi party. Before the Rwanda genocide in 1994, Tutsi people were referred to as cockroaches. Words, name-calling, hateful phrases, casual racist comments - they all have an impact, especially if those words become convincing to a large number of people.
__label__Attack	I think it demonstrates clearly how often AI struggles to detect hate speech or misclassifies innocent content as hateful - it would just further restrict freedom of speech.
__label__Position	It shouldn't be solely a newspaper issues. All aspects of society need to tackle the issue. Check out this article below. There seems to have been a focus on criminal punishment with new legislation allowing an increase in sentencing for hate crimes. Still a long way to go but these are positive stats: https://www.cps.gov.uk/crime-info/hate-crime
__label__Position	By utilising AI so that it can look for certain words that could be deemed offensive.
__label__Support	It would have the advantage of searching out offensive words prior to them actually being printed and could be stopped before they are.
__label__Position	Holding platforms responsible for all content they publish would help
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	i think this is a good idea but moderators would be time consuming and it depends on what is not harmful to one person maybe harmful to somebody else
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	policing this is good
__label__Attack	If the newspaper website does not monitor the comments on their platform then who will? They have just as much responsibility to stop hate speech as the public and need to be involved in this issue.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Support	I agree, we need to be brought to seeing things from different angles and possibility of discussion is actually a good thing. Raising awareness on hate speech is key and should be taught from a young age.
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Support	I would say the same
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	Hate speech is removed
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Support	This would fully eliminate hate speech
__label__Position	Censor specific words often attributed to hate speech so they can not be used in comment sections.
__label__Position	If the hate speech needs to be looked at, then it should go back to editor of the paper and question why are they agreeing to this.
__label__Position	someone to check their posts before the article goes live, like a robot think
__label__Attack	Who would do this?
__label__Position	Someone should monitor the chat, and those who use hate speech should be given 1 warning before being removed from the website.
__label__Support	Moderators if educated on what hate speech was would be a good idea
__label__Position	Hate speech allows factors such as race and racism to come into play https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea
__label__Position	I have to agree with @NormanW. People are allowed freedom of speech ofcourse, but as the term, "politically correct"states, we have to still be mindful of how we go about stating our diffences of opinion or stances on a certain topic. If a comment is too abrasive in terms of it leaning towards pejudice, discrimination or racila slurs, such a user should atleast be issued one warning, before finally being banned from commenting on such post, if he/she were to abuse their right to comment.
__label__Position	There are a number of organizations which work to eradicate hate speech especially on social media as it is a form of cyber bullying
__label__Attack	I believe those algorithms are not programmed to dealing with hate speech. Otherwise, social media would not be as toxic and emotionally as it is
__label__Position	"Freedom of Speech'...that's a popular consensus among the masses, regardless of the "casualities" that are left on the wayside. Having reread a lot of the comments posted here, I do consider the possibility of having people comment as they wish, politically correct or not. HOWEVER, let there be consequences involved, such as naming and shaming, and acquring user details if need be, after all, things such as cyber crime, online harrassment, etc do exist, am I right? And so, if such a comment borders on this, let it become a criminal matter and have law enforcement dealing specifically in cyber-related crimes become involved. Problem solved.
__label__Position	https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hate-speech-social-media-global-comparisons
__label__Position	It's honestly depressing how we've been having this discussion for almost a decade. This article offers a great deep dive: https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation
__label__Position	It would be appropiate to to reduce the commenting on certain parts of the webpage to stop the hatred and racism or even block out certain words so people who genually want to reply can do so without people aiming there remarks at them in the comments section.
__label__Position	Alot of people suffer with mental health, This article makes you understand we are not alone wihen we suffer at the hands of bullies online, I think this is a must read even for those who are trying to understand the affects of mental health. https://www.verywellmind.com/mental-health-effects-of-reading-negative-comments-online-5090287
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Attack	Eliminating the space for reader comments would be violating free speech, in my opinion it would be much better to have every incident recorded as a Non-crime hate incident'. The government needs to have stricter and clearer laws on what entails hate crime and hate incidents.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Attack	@LawrenceM and @AndrewA said it best. This world is already in utter chaos. Humanity? Is that even a thing anymore. Lets's not add further to a world which is breeding hate, discrimination, selfish propoganda, etc on a daily basis. And for the love of all things good, let's use our limited time and energy on this earth to promote tolerance, acceptance and understanding when dealing with matters or situations that we find uncommon or "alien"to us.

__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it.

__label__Attack	I agree but what is to be done about those who use hate speech? Do we just let them be? And what about the newspaper's reputation? Should they be known as a newspaper that allows people to comment on whatever they like with no repercussions?
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Support	Exactly. People want to feel as if they are part of the conversation. Removing the comment section just has the opposite effect.
__label__Support	I agree. I personally enjoy posting my opinion thinking people think I'm smart. I don't know if I change people's minds but I think in the moment, I think I'm both clever and nice. If I couldn't comment, it'd ruin the whole Facebook post experience for me. (Source: My experience)
__label__Support	Newspapers have to be free to censor but finding the balance between legitimate comment and hate speech is more difficult that it first appears. We can have different thresholds of what we find acceptable in an open forum.
__label__Support	We need to express ourselves as the public.
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Attack	disagree, chat feature is useful
__label__Attack	Newspapers ARE these platforms, or should be, in my opinion. Why not allow news to be challenged in the place where it is presented? Why risk leaving it unchallenged?
__label__Attack	I agree with your idea. However, there is a thin line between freedom of speech and hate speech. How will it be made more transparent to others what is what?
__label__Attack	What if the moderators are biased themselves?
__label__Attack	Aren't we surveilled enough as it is?
__label__Support	Definitely discussions should be moderated - so much extra info and nuance comes from reading the comments below an article, but not is the comments section turns into a free-for-all
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	It will filter out how people truly feel which defeats the purpose of freedom of speech
__label__Support	ensures a safe and protected readers environment
__label__Support	I see where you're coming from, but if someone is just posting racist words, then their comment should be removed. If the commenter is intelligent and using reasoning in the form of putting out their point, explaining it, then providing evidence. Then regardless of the bias, I'm sure most moderators should let that go. I think people aren't that stupid.
__label__Support	This is very true and likely
__label__Position	Newspapers or magazines should have computer programs which filter out hate speech and then have some people who can remove hate speech which could not be filtered.
__label__Position	I believe the fairest way is the hardest way and that's to have a small group of people moderating REAL hate speech and spam. If someone wants to just use a racist term or promote their website, then these people's comment should be removed and they should be banned from commenting for a period of time. The idea to remove comments entirely is absurd as the news is not trustworthy enough to be the sole voice people hear. We need to hear other voices.
__label__Support	I agree that moderators are all too often bias one way or the other so only extreme hate speech should be censored.
__label__Position	I believe there should be a bot that automatically sorts through comments, to eliminate the ones that are not appropriate, there is no need to eliminate the chat feature.
__label__Position	If it is digital newspaper the best idea would be to implement a auto detect tool that will detect and block harmful/hate speech.
__label__Position	There can never be any one side to a story and it is important for the readers of an article to engage on it,so with that said, the comment space shouldn't be eliminated but a robot can be created to monitor the readers comments, flagging hate speech, racism and cyber bulling. the punishment should be revoking those readers subscription to the newspaper for a certain period as the brand itself wouldn't want to want to be associated with such
__label__Position	I think if a site changed from being able to comment to not being able to comment such as my Facebook feed, then I'd be very upset and possibly boycott the website like everyone else would. However, I also have Apple news where I just read the news and can't comment, but I'm perfectly fine with this. People want a voice, if it's hateful, other people will know. The question for me becomes if Facebook removes commenting from news posts, is that a good thing. No.
__label__Position	I've gone over most opinions on this topic. The best solution would be a bot that would filter out the harmful comments
__label__Support	as long that bot will be consistently and effectively enforced

__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	I think you are confusing hate speech with a controversial opinion. Hate speech would be saying a racist word 5 times; a controversial opinion would be that dinosaurs don't exist because of the square cube law.
__label__Attack	In an ideal world allowing all forms of free speech would be good but unfortunately it would likely result in racial and religious hatred and violent content.

__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree

__label__Position	define hate speech, write it is not allowed where comments are and provide moderators to remove any posts which contain it,
__label__Position	Could the comments be 'policed' by either an algorithm or reviewers looking for some key words that are frequently used by people who leave hate speech
__label__Position	The best way to reduce hate speech would be to make sure that moderators are present to check on comments, it would not be advisable to cancel comments completely due the feedback it gives and people will always have their opinions and sometimes they will involve hate speech, which is unavoidable...
__label__Attack	yes, and don't remove all post, just the part that contains what is termed hate speech,
__label__Attack	If the accurate information is given.
__label__Support	If everyone is honest about what they saw.
__label__Attack	yes, I agree, need moderators,
__label__Attack	unfortunately, people may continue to not adhere with the proper language of communication under comments.
__label__Support	freedom of speech and opinion to the articles the news we read.
__label__Support	I absolutely agree that people need to have an outlet to share their opinion, whatever that is. And the only reason to really turn comments off is where someone is seeking information, and have their answer/are satisfied with the response; but on a news site, I feel like blocking comments is a cop out for a controversial story, or to protect the sources feelings rather than giving the public a right to have a say.
__label__Position	It needs moderation of the website . If people cannot understand what hate speech, then that is their problem. Hate speech causes deaths.
__label__Position	Assigning moderators to root out the hate speech and using an algorithm that detects and instantly report anything that might elude to hate speech.
__label__Position	https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea
__label__Position	I believe it is very unfair to be fed with information that is limited to commenting or having an opinion, maybe a concern form should me signed on the website to bind people from using foul language.
__label__Position	In summary most of the points made regarding the elimination of hate speech were very insightful and some were really good ideas. The idea to have users flag bad comments and they be hidden and later checked by moderators was a great idea, another good idea was to help make people aware of the impact hate speech causes to some individuals.
__label__Position	I suggest that there should be some kind of concern form on the website to bind users from not using foul language or hate speech. This will help people state factual arguments or getting their opinions without hate speech. However, people must have freedom of speech and opinion to what they read.
__label__Position	I think that the newspaper websites should keep reader comments but ensure that people are able to comply to having their opinions factually and intuitively backed up to ensure that they do not fall into hate speech. At the same time these comment spaces should be monitored to remove any comments which are hate speech and keep the comments strictly to free speech opinions about the topic of debate.
__label__Position	Yes I was reading a little about a few starting points to combat the hate speech and it was a good resource to help us move forward in reducing the impact hate speech has. You can find it on this link. https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea
__label__Position	Comments sections are necessary, but need moderation.
__label__Position	Many people feel that hate speech could be eliminated by more policing of the content through moderators or algorithms; or by removing comment sections entirely. I don't either of these are the solution, as everyone will have an opinion and whether they share hate speech online or in some other outlet, I'm not convinced that's the way to manage it. I think educating people on what's acceptable and on what hate speech actually is, is important. As perhaps some people spread this negativity out of ignorance or their values and beliefs because it's how they were raised by bigoted older generations. Knowledge is certainly power. I think over policing will encourage people to act out more and moderating is a very time-consuming thankless task that really isn't valued much by people in forums and groups. Shadowing may be a better option, where moderators or even just general members of a group can hide a comment that is offensive, but the person who has written it, and their friends, can't tell that there's been any change. Where a comment is deeply toxic on a website or forum, delete and block the person. Newspapers - well, it's really down to the editor what gets published.

__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Attack	https://diverseminds.co.uk/hatecrime/ - As much as you say this the effects of hate crime on an individual are not anything that should be allowed to flourish. If newspapers where to physically allow and endorse this type of "free speech" on their platform they simply shouldn't be able to have a platform. It also gives right of way for those who think with pure ignorance to voice a factually incorrect and exaggerated opinion. These are not the types of opinions that should be openly shared or taught on the internet and in any given situation that it could happen they need to restrict it. To reduce free speech may be an infringement but allow hateful speech is just wrong.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	Yes that's right.
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Attack	THE FREEDOM OF COMMENTING MUST COME WITH A RESPONSIBILITY NOT INFRINGING OTHERS INCLUDING HATE SPEECH
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	This could be a good approach. Education is important
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Support	It's true that this would eliminate hate speech
__label__Attack	This would be costly in terms of time and manpower.
__label__Attack	Moderators have biases as well which could result in a censorship of differing opinions that do not qualify as hate speech.
__label__Position	It is important for people to voice their opions so I do not thik this discussion is fair, however I do agree that comments should be moderated. The readers should also be made aware of the rules that apply to commenting with regards to hateful speech.
__label__Support	Making the rules up front is definitely a good idea and I agree that the comments need to be moderated in order to enforce those rules.
__label__Position	From what I read, a lot of you agree that the freedom to write comments is important but that there need to be rules to ensure there is no hate speech. If a newspaper has a comments section then they must employ moderators to police those comments sections and ensure that everyone makes their points within etiquette rules.
__label__Attack	I think it depends the level of "hate speech". This is very undefined and to subject it to the same level as a crime in "the real world" is a bit extreme. Otherwise I do agree moderation of what people say on social media is needed
__label__Position	Moderation seems to be a popular idea that generally I agree with. That being said I also think there should be a way to report comments that contain hate speech in order to streamline the moderation process and ensure problematic comments and commenters are addressed in a timely manner.
__label__Position	Social media pages often attract trolls and hate speech. For groups that want to feel safe, moderators make these pages a much more pleasant place to be. The same could be applied to online newspapers, allowing free comment but with moderators keeping an eye to make sure no hate speech or abuse was occuring.
__label__Position	I think comments should be approved by someone before going live.
__label__Position	Moderators should be used, as well comments that are flagged as hate speech can be moved towards the bottom of the comments and hidden so they are less visible, till a moderator can remove them.
__label__Position	Freedom of speech does not equal hate speech. “Addressing hate speech does not mean limiting or prohibiting freedom of speech. It means keeping hate speech from escalating into something more dangerous, particularly incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence, which is prohibited under international law.” Source: https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech
__label__Position	AI could be used to flag hate speech, meaning comments that are hate speech can be flagged at the time. The tech needs more work though based on this article: https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/04/1025742/ai-hate-speech-moderation/
__label__Attack	AI may also let hate speech slip through the cracks.
__label__Support	AI would be a great tool in conjunction with other moderation measures but is not reliable enough to be used on its own.
__label__Position	By disabling harmful and hateful words from what someone can comment. If we are able to black specific words and phrases that. could be considered hateful or derogatory, hate speech would be a lot less in comments and it wouldn't prevent readers from still commenting.
__label__Position	Removing or limiting ones ability to comment or express their thoughts and opinions brings into question "freedom of speech". However freedom of speech should not be prioritised over the wellbeing of other people in terms of cyber bullying and discrimination. And for that reason in order to prevent serious hate speech considered derogatory or that puts groups of people in a vulnerable position, what we are able to say on social media should be regulated.
__label__Support	a more toward automation
__label__Position	This is a complex issue. While websites should do their best to counter hate speech, some see this as curtailing freedoms. However, freedom ends at the point where hatred fuels harm. I think the platform should strictly moderate the comments sections and remove posts that are deemed hateful and ban those making them.
__label__Attack	The negative aspect would be how moderators are going to decide whetehr it is a hate crime or not. Manupliating the moderators could be an issue.
__label__Attack	Crowdsource moderation is a great idea, similar to reddit where people can vote, but there are still moderators who can remove posts completely if they break sub rules
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Support	Sadly I must agree. Ongoing monitoring of comments would take too much effort and time. It is simpler to just remove the comments and let the newspaper articles stand for themselves. Pople can always link the article to their own twitter post and comment there if they feel the need to add their own thoughts.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Attack	I appreciate that everyone has the right to freedom of speech but at the expense of others and being hateful?
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Support	I agree, making it harder for hate speech to be posted through filters etc makes more sense than to remove a space where people can have genuine discussions.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__Attack	https://www.salon.com/2018/11/17/why-comments-sections-must-die/ While this article seems to agree with this point of view, I still feel that taking away spaces for discussion isn't the way to control hate speech.
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.

__label__Attack	this literally defeats the point of the internet. We stopped being passive consumers a while ago, and removing the ability to express your opinion is moving back instead of forward.
__label__Attack	this makes no sense. Newspapers are already biased
__label__Position	I think that the best way to reduce hate speech in newspapers' websites is to have a robust and consistent moderation policy. It might delay the posting of comments but at least that way no one can use the space negatively.
__label__Attack	This still leaves comment sections open to abuse and may embolden other readers to pile onto the hate speech comments with hateful comments of their own.
__label__Position	Reduce hate speech by screening out certain words. If a comment contains such words, it is deleted or hidden from public view
__label__Position	I believe that newspaper websites can create an algorithm that filters certain speech that is negative and harmful. They can have systems in place to delete comments that are hateful and keep positive comments to still allow for others to freely share their opinions.
__label__Position	I believe that newspaper websites can create an algorithm that filters certain speech that is negative and harmful. They can have systems in place to delete comments that are hateful and keep positive comments to still allow for others to freely share their opinions.
__label__Position	People need to be filtered if their they not talking about the set topic in the comment section, freedom if speech is abused.
__label__Position	i think there are words that could be blocked out when commenting. Swear words, hate words or just unnecessary words.
__label__Position	We can fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites by having an initial screening of certain questions to determine if a potential commenter is prejudice in any way. As previously mentioned an algorhytim or computer could determine what is positively answered or negatively answered, and the positive participants would be allowed in the sites where the negative people would not have access to.
__label__Position	In reflection of everyone's opinion on this matter, I still believe it is important for people to be able to share their views. There are many solutions that can be explored and implemented to at least reduce, if not eliminate hate speech commentary. The pro to removing comment space is complete elimination or reduction of the hate speech phenomenon but it would infringe on the basic right to free speech. Algorithms to filter and education policies to teach people about the impact of their opinions are some of the ways we can begin to tackle the issue before taking extreme measures.
__label__Position	i am surprised by people who think the hate comments must be allowed as they show freedom of speech
__label__Position	the comments must just be filtered
__label__Position	In South Africa , After the ANC was elected to rule, There was a truth and reconciliation that was held by members of the public and officials of the new government. They where persecuting's human rights offenders and those who where charged with Apartheid crimes. So a lot of core things where said , that's where you could see that hate speech is hate speech to the person receiving I most cases , but to the person saying/commenting it is just an opinion of what they think of per say subject
__label__Position	I was completely taken aback by some strong stances to remove the comment space, and the belief in that because Newspapers should be one-sided providers. I would disagree because newspaper share societal information and society should be allowed to engage and be part of the conversation instead of just consuming whatever information is being released for consumption. It has been seen as a result of other newspaper websites removing the comment section that it reduces the trust of the reader because they are aware of the bias of the information they are consuming, and also it reduces the amount of time readers spend on these sites because there is no community engagements. Source: https://www.techdirt.com/2021/11/08/killing-website-comment-sections-wasnt-brilliant-move-many-newsroom-leaders-assumed/
__label__Position	The vast majority of digital news consumers - that is 76% in America, read comments sections. This means by removing them were missing a big chance at limiting the harmful effects of echo chambers and encouraging consumers to think critically and question things
__label__Attack	I disagree. Removing the comments section is limiting access to echo chambers, quite literally.
__label__Position	https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14648849211069241
__label__Attack	Even with human moderators it still comes down to personal preference. There is no person alive who doesn't have ANY biases. what one human moderator might deem acceptable language another might not. Therefore, even human moderation isn't 100% accurate and failsafe.

__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks.

__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.

The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Support	Totally agree with this. Raise awareness of the problem. Talk to friends about why hate speech is not a problem for the internet only but for our societies as well.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy

__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	This should prevent such comments from being printed, but I think any attempt to 'educate' such persons is totally futile. They are hard-wired to hold that point of view, often drilled into them by parents/caregivers.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	Reducing hate speech shouldn't be the focus. The problem lies in the reactions to it - in particular, giving the drastic perspectives too much attention. This attention only encourages more of the debate and problematic perspectives. Though total ignorance would also be unfair, so really we need a position of just LESS attention and care given to such perspectives.
__label__Attack	Realistically this would probably work, but it would no doubt still have problems like people raising issues of 'suppressing free speech' etc.
__label__Position	As many of the opinions and comments iterate that it is not the responsibility of the media whether or not something is published with hate speech or not i disagree with this because if the person hadnt to have a platform to be heard and voice them self it would definitely go a little less noticed. That being said laws need to be passed on the extent of hate speech that they post as everyone is entitled to an opinion, however not everyone's opinion is from a good space or logical which we tend to dismiss the repercussions of the behavior of hate speech.
__label__Support	I agree it really is up to the publisher to include comments. I don't believe that not allowing a platform will reduce hate speech.
__label__Attack	Does not give diversity to the story.
__label__Position	I think that what we can do at this point is to raise awareness on the issue of hate speech and what it can do to people online or offline.
__label__Position	Control what is printed or posted to make sure that it is diverse and does not contain any hate speech but the message they are trying to get across they are able to. That way newspaper can leave the comment section and different opinions are heard and expressed and no one gets hurt.

__label__Attack	There could be a risk with this. In an article from 2016 (https://www.jstor.org/stable/44014621) Flaxman et al. make the following point in their abstract: 'the vast majority of online news consumption is accounted for by individuals simply visiting the home pages of their favorite, typically mainstream, news outlets'. If this is the case, it's possible that the 'diverse' opinions will be in a cycle of one sided shared opinions, and few 'other' or opposed opinions. These could well end up being quite extreme, and the policy to include other opinions could well serve the opposite function of promoting hate speech when it is a massive minority.....maybe.
__label__Position	the fairly way of reducing hate speech from newspapers website is not allowing anyone to comment that is to bloc the comment section.
__label__Support	This works if the media had some guidelines to go by, otherwise everyone's level of what would be allowed would be different.
__label__Position	create a team of people that can look for and remove the hate speech and leave all other respectful arguments to make the comment section diverse.
__label__Attack	This sounds like a very expensive solution - I think maybe more time and money should be spent on algorithms that can do the same thing
__label__Attack	This sounds easy enough to implement however it begs the question as to why it has not been done already does it not?
__label__Position	I think that the most position that suprissed me was a person agreeing that that hate speech should be allowed. How can that be allowed when it can be a problem on people's mental health? I think that moderating the comment section to approve comments should be prioritised.Some posts would need more attention and be looked at carefuly.
__label__Position	I think that removing readers comments will never deal with the problem of hate. The readers comments section is a valuable area which allows people to debate opinions. The only way to reduce hate speech is by educating future generations, telling them that differences in society are valuable. Disabling comments simply censors people and that can never be a good thing.
__label__Position	Websites should invest in software to remove hate speech, this would allow for healthy debate without racist or descrimination.
__label__Attack	I disagree! There could errors in implanting this to begin with and it may discourage them from using it, and therefore these products in general. I feel a dedicated team for tackling this matter or if a smaller company general overseers from time to time would be better and also hold a more human opinion on whether it is deemed hate or not.
__label__Position	The idea that media should be able to stop a conversation is wrong and this is what would happen if comments were removed.
__label__Attack	I agree with you on the fact the media controlling what we view can be untrustworthy and outright terrifying, however in the view of hate speech and affecting the health of authors and committed readers mentally factors in more greatly than this, in my personal opinion.
__label__Support	The media should not be in control of what we view, though. And I can see the side of your thinking. Perhaps with the option to view said removed comments makes this more plausible for you? I wonder how that changes your opinion, if at all of course.
__label__Position	I feel strongly on the fact that despite the troubles they can create, without them would limit the possibility for conversation. They will begin to use this feature as a scapegoat and we will be worse off as a result! https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/

__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Attack	there might be a negative effect on the newspaper being sold
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	I agree with this statement. When we didn't have any computers, people didn't have the luxury to comment instantly.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Support	Efficient, less controversial
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Support	very true
__label__Attack	This opens an avenue for hate speech to be supported by the fact that it falls under 'free speech'.
__label__Support	Fair
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Attack	I still think newspapers hold quite a bit of merit when it comes to what they post.
__label__Attack	also most newspapers stories are also posted online and out there forever on the internet.
__label__Support	Im not sure many people believe everything reporters report in the news. I know I don`t trust everything I read.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	Newspapers can't be one sided, they should give a balanced, fair point of view
__label__Attack	Newspapers are not supposed to be one-sided in the first place; they're supposed to give all the information, which will include different viewpoints by nature to avoid bias. This seems like a slippery-slope to accepting journalists' opinions as fact.
__label__Attack	But are moderators available to this? And who agrees what can be said and what can't be?
__label__Position	Hate speech is for sure an issue on newspaper/journalism websites. I don't think that removing the comment section is the way to go, however, there does need to be some type of moderation to make sure that people still feel safe and comfortable getting the news. A moderation team or algorithm seems okay, but will also require a lot of resources to get set up. Another option could be community moderation, where people can flag and report comments if they are inappropriate. Again, this is difficult to implement fully, because people will abuse the function or otherwise find ways around it. We should also consider what we as individuals can do - can we help to educate people around us so that they don't spread hate speech around?
__label__Position	I think the first step to reducing hate speech in readers comments should be in the form of a moderation team in which they filter inappropriate comments. I think it should be a group of people rather than AI to do this to ensure all hate speech within a variety of contexts are eliminated, as if this was done by a computer there is risk of hate spilling through. For example, hate speech on the social media platform Twitter can often be missed as users purposefully misspell hateful speech to ensure it does not flag up on the AI searches, going as far as hateful language misspelt actually trending on Twitter.
__label__Attack	The thing is if people filter these comments, they may not work as accurate as AI. For example, they may use their own judgements to decide if something is appropriate. If we use AI, we can simply add new filters, like words or phrases, AI will filter all comments in the way we "teach" it.
__label__Attack	This is a horribly uninformed and unnecessarily inflammatory opinion, EmilyN. Are you saying that people who want to target, insult, and threaten others should be more protected that the people who are being threatened (i.e. the victims)? Just food for thought.
__label__Position	Newspaper websites may eliminate comments, employ moderators, or limit comments to subscribed users. There are options to address hateful comments.
__label__Attack	This article (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17512786.2013.859838?casa_token=V_anYAQrBCIAAAAA%3A8IhQZy8qfCjnjwaIRbnec33KKLtJ-bMtB2hlHbj2F-zaeHbi--55gbSq8lsDIkCmhmSQE1khpVZRD9M) states that comments are integral to keeping news fresh and discussed. Having news discussed by people is what sparks change in our society, so they are still important and probably shouldn't be removed!
__label__Position	In summary, I think we should not remove comment sections. We need to "teach" AI to filter the comment section on newspaper websites. In that way, we can add or remove filters, and AI will simply do the work of making sure the comment section is appropriate. People should not get involved to directly filter comments, they may not be fair at all.
__label__Attack	I would agree, but this article (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0163443712472089?casa_token=FJm_UB0wIqEAAAAA%3ALr9dI-lrHJemMa9XgBVkx8tCkSQUSUAg14owxExDkpThv0tpIu6LJySR_p7EJ_lPqQbiATTxEfULs7k) states that filtering racism doesn't really stop racism, it just encourages it to go elsewhere. Maybe it will protect sites that use it, but otherwise, people will still find racism online. And maybe that's not the responsibility of the news site, but I find it disheartening still.
__label__Position	I think we could have a hold on comments until it is checked and fact checked by a panel of people! Not just one person making the decision. Also I think if there were stricter punishments for hate speech the newspaper would make the person and newspaper think twice.
__label__Support	It could be damaging for allinvo
__label__Attack	People are entitled to freedom of speech and shouldn't have their views taken away from them
__label__Support	Stop unnessacary hate towards people
__label__Support	Newspapers tend to be one sided so other people having an opinion may benefit
__label__Position	have word filters
__label__Attack	already said
__label__Support	Already said
__label__Attack	News papers might get very restrictive
__label__Support	people would be forewarned so they could avoid upsetting content
__label__Position	There can never truly be free speech. While we can try and censor words that might be offensive, there will always be someone offended whether that was your intention or not. I don't think there will be a solution to this
__label__Position	I may have to walk back on my idea about trigger warnings. This study showed that trigger warnings can cause more harm than good in some cases 5f3d455fc5a9c209cb8b94b4.
__label__Position	This filter algorithm is not perfect but its name is easily remembered and if a website states that they are using it maybe contributors would be less likely to use hate speech.https://innovationinpolitics.eu/showroom/project/stop-hate-speech-with-bot-dog/
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Support	i do get your point, some hate speech does get severe, which is what should be removed, i think some should be removed from root, and yes some topics need you to talk about them
__label__Attack	the issue with an algorithm is that is isnt able to sympathise with news. yes it is good to filter out bad words but i think hate speech can be relative to the user digesting that information
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Attack	I agree, however the issue then becomes 'How do we go about finding the root cause '
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Support	I agree 100%. And to add people should be asked to explain their comments. Most hateful comments are just people trolling and looking to cause a stir.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Attack	If facts are given sources should be used to back this up.
__label__Support	If opinions are given it should be clear they are opinions and not facts.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	may stop people being 'keyboard warriors' and hiding behind a screen
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	Have moderators who constantly monitor and remove hateful posts or ones that are inciting others/goading others.
__label__Attack	the issue of bias becomes an issue in determining what or what not to remove.
__label__Position	I think developing a system that will flag certain words, the post then should be automatically prohibited, this will help in filtering the comments.
__label__Support	Thank you! Some hate is seriously not necessary
__label__Support	https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/
__label__Support	Free speech
__label__Support	True picture of peoples lives will be shared and discussed
__label__Position	A more fundamental question might be, should we allow for comments on online newspaper articles at all? Is that the right place or forum for a proper discussion of the issues? The news cycle has become more instant, with a constant impulse to be first to report and for people to interact. Is this how news should be disseminated?
__label__Position	We live in a word where negative comments and hate speech are bound to arise but it is, and should, the newspapers to try to regulate that with some type of code that omits bad language and trigger words. The space for readers comments is important in stimulating conversations about pressing matters, it could also help in collaboratively finding solutions to these matters too.
__label__Position	The comment section should have a filter and a down rating for comments that promote hate speech.
__label__Position	I believe that any information platform should be a neutral space where people (readers) can be allowed to express their opinions. People will always disagree or have uninformed perspectives and silencing them is not the answer. I think that most hate speech is usually fueled with misinformation, bad experiences and emotion. Hence these platforms could be used to expose and address these views.
__label__Position	Newspapers should make it mandatory to register a profile for a user to be able to make comments on the newspaper's comment section, in that way the newspaper will have the information of those who perpetuate hate speech. The users will then be banned from the platform and if the case of hate speech is extreme then legal action should be taken against the user.
__label__Position	Newspapers should not remove the comment section. They should rather require users who would like to comment to have a registered account with a paid subscription. Rules protecting other users should be set and failure to follow them will result in a suspension of the subscription of those who are guilty and the forfeiture of any funds.
__label__Position	Joseph Raised a powerful point that there are a few ways to reduce hate speech without eliminating reader's comments. They spoke on a point that stood out to be about having a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or dissaproving comments before they are posted to the public. although this might default on the topic of freedom of speach.

__label__Position	I believe regulation of the comment space is the way to go. The likes of introducing a down rating of a comment and a comment with high down ratings if and only if is about hate speech then is removed and the user get to be blocked from accessing the platform
__label__Attack	Freedom of speech and thought are both really important and allow people to sometimes 'clear' their minds of thoughts.
__label__Position	Everyone needs to be clear that sometimes the comments are purely other peoples opinions and not facts.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Attack	This would be great if people would not abuse the power to share freely by sharing hate speech and slander. us as humans need to be regulated by a set of rules in order to keep a functioning society and i think a filtered comment section is the solution.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Attack	Newspaper articles are for delivering news not for people's opinion.
__label__Attack	I agree the comment section is for everyone- but what else can we do. Evidence has shown that hate speech can lead to real life crimes, and that needs to be tackled.
__label__Support	I absolutely agree with this. As we've seen recently (https://medium.com/dfrlab/alt-right-and-alt-social-media-4fa23eb2fbd1) cracking down on the more ofensive comments on one website can lead to groups of people finding a more lenient place and bunching up there, creating a vicious cycle where they push each other to be more and more extreme. It's true that we should monitor the comment section, but overdoing it could lead to worse results somewhere else.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Attack	I think the autor should have some saying if she/he likes the comment.
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.

__label__Attack	comments can dilute the validity of the story
__label__Support	I totaly agree, it will help to screen the comments in a way to avoid such incidences where people say things that can be hateful to another person. With the help of the technology i do belive this can be achieved in future to avoid being violated.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	Everyone has a right to free speech
__label__Position	By simply monitoring the comments and blocking the negative ones and removing them
__label__Position	I think one way to reduce hate speech online would be monitoring the message. If someone writes a message, it should be checked before allowing it to be posted, it could be done by a simple program where the computer looks for offensive words.
__label__Attack	To read a persons message would be an invasion of privacy
__label__Support	I agree with this! It would reduce hate speech.
__label__Position	Pros
__label__Position	Like others have said I think the best way to deal with hate speech in the comments section is by putting in place a moderation system. When the commenter hits send on his post a moderator or bot check the contents of the message and decide whether it should be published or not.
__label__Attack	It could take a long time for them to be reviewed, leaving the conversation no longer relevant.
__label__Position	In my opinion all the comments should be screened before they are shared with the viewers
__label__Position	I think this is a task that is hard to do because it has to be done in a way that would not hinder freedom of speech but at the same time not attack people. Thus, I think comments should be flagged depending on the words used but not be deleted until it has been checked.
__label__Support	This can hinder the increase of hate speech by filtering out the hate words
__label__Support	It can be fooled by the writing of the bad word, like in some social media.
__label__Position	Pros
__label__Attack	I think that removing the comment section on specific topics is important
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites, the website providers could set up a system that requires readers who want to comment to give their full name. On top of that, the website provider can ban hate speech and hateful comments.
__label__Position	I think allowing some special space to allow it also would be helpful instead of cutting comments off.
__label__Attack	If comments are really harmful towards certain groups of people I would rather that the provider cuts them off.
__label__Position	After doing some follow up reading from https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/what-is-online-hate-crime/ I have seen how the anonymity of these online comments can be what makes it so easy for people to be hateful. Therefore, an easy solution would be to make it impossible for people to comment anonymously, and have people have to provide personal information. However, I am not sure how this would work from a data protection point of view. It is certainly a start.
__label__Attack	Possible infringment on data
__label__Support	Reduces hate speech
__label__Position	In general I believe the comment section should only be available if people are ready to share their identity. This would minimize the hateful comments. On top of that, it is important to educate people on the topic and the consequences of hate speech. Furthermore, the comment section could be edited by the provider so that hate speech that targets specific people or minorities could be cut off.
__label__Position	Comments can do many things like broaden people's perspective or dilute the validity of the news. But when you remove comments then people will not be able to appreciate all the different things that comments can do. The 'bad' in this case does not outweigh the 'benefit' of having a comment section.
__label__Position	I believe censoring hate speech does violate the freedom of speech right, however, hate speech that promotes danger, discrimination, and violence can be removed. "Addressing hate speech does not mean limiting or prohibiting freedom of speech. It means keeping hate speech from escalating into something more dangerous, particularly incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence, which is prohibited under the law" (https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech)
__label__Position	With reference to AndreasS comment, monitoring the posts will provide censorship. Hate speech can be reduced but it can be successful with the considerations made in the debate. https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/combat-online-hate-speech/#:~:text=Here%E2%80%99s%20how%20you%20can%20help%20combat%20hate%20speech,hate%20about%20the%20worst%20instances%20you%20see.%20
__label__Position	I belieeve we need to promote restrainment from people, educating is better than canceling because you are not solving the problem by canceling peoplle or their views.
__label__Support	I agree with this statement. Updates can also be installed to reduce the number of inappropriate comments
__label__Support	basing it on the public opinion is better. So I agree with the second part more
__label__Support	Creates a civil and friendly space on the website without elimination of comment section.
__label__Attack	This relies on people being impartial, which can never be certain. https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/alternative-truths/201006/the-persistent-illusion-impartiality
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.

__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	I agree. So many crimes/acts of violence in the real world have begun as online comments. It is certainly an important topic to discuss and find the right solutio n for.
__label__Support	Hate speech is a platform that can violate another person in any way, all the comments should be screened in order to avoid such happening in our society
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	I completely agree, the internet already needed policies to stop hate speech or insults.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Support	This is a fair point -- maybe removing the influence of comment sections altogether will stop the trend of news increasingly becoming 'comment' and being less objective in reporting. If people want to exercise their free speech about the article's content, they can still share the article and express their opinions on it elsewhere, like on their personal social media channels.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	Unfortunately,others might say it is censorship
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	Agree, moderation is the way to go, as hate speech should not be part of any media forums.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	Comments should be regulated, but comment space should not be removed.
__label__Support	reasonable discussion and points
__label__Position	comments containing hate speech should be deleted
__label__Position	There is no need to reduce hate speech, we just need to accept it. Banning or reducing hate speech is just censorship which is not acceptable.
__label__Position	We could indicate that hate speech is prohibited and that a fine will be given and possible imorisonment
__label__Position	I dont think it is a fair choice. For how long should people be silenced. Hate speech is always going to be around. Shutting people up is not going to stop hate speech.
__label__Attack	this will encourage strives among the community
__label__Support	This will help the newspaper and community to know which areas affect people the most and help them
__label__Position	We should have a clear definition for hate speech in order to regulate the comment section. For example, comments suggesting certain groups be harmed or should not exist, and language that suggests these groups are inferior without providing educational evidence. We need to keep the comment section a place of discussion and education.
__label__Support	I firmly agree. Comment sections need to be regulated not banned. Rules need to be put in place on what will be considered as hate speech with that,the consequences of part taking in the said hate speech.
__label__Position	Most people there have no idea what freedom really is : you are all socialist, you all wants to control what people do or think by putting walls everywhere. You are the root of totalitarism.
__label__Attack	Right to free speech isn't necessarily a right to a platform or a publisher. Before the internet, people weren't entitled to have their comments on the news stapled inside a copy of the paper. They were just able to express their opinions on it independently, to family or coworkers, or by writing their own publication in response. I'm not sure if newspapers simply choosing not to publish readers' comments (which is what they are doing by hosting those comments on their site) is the same as censoring free speech. By this logic, anyone who writes a poorly written opinion piece and submits it to the New York Times should get it published, because otherwise their speech is oppressed.
__label__Position	There is no discussion on free speech to have : free speech is absolute or not. If you don't like free speech then go live in China.
__label__Attack	People will speak what is on their mind
__label__Position	Hate crimes have significantly increased in the past 10 years from 40K to 110K, with the increase in communication but the education has not been able to keep up. Newspapers have the duty to educate and help reduce crime.
__label__Position	The pros of removing comment sections would be to eradicate the spreadof hate speech. Certain individuals thrive on adding fuel to fire. In this case having the comment section deleted would be a positive thing. On the other hand only by having differing opinions can discussions and debates happen. So if someone spews hate speech only then can we see the extent to which someone disagrees with a certain group/viewpoint etc. https://rm.coe.int/starting-points-for-combating-hate-speech-online/16809c85ea
__label__Position	The newspapers should encourage the victims of hate speech to report hate speech published, establish monitoring and evaluation units in newsrooms. Some units should be tasked with monitoring hate speech trends, compiling reports and bringing these to the attention of key institutions
__label__Support	Gathering data in a specific area of online discussion like newspaper comment sections would probably reveal a lot about how online discourse turns to hate speech and how to tackle it as a problem. Maybe this task could be given to an independent or charitable institution, with the newspapers' cooperation?
__label__Attack	doesn't discuss free speech - cant limiting free speech lead to hate crimes
__label__Position	Regulations of comment sections has been proven with various other platforms to be the best solution. When there are clear rules put in place regarding what should be considered as hate speech and the consequences of the part taking in such could lead to eg. A ban from the being able to comment for a certain period of time.
__label__Support	allows the expression and discussion of points which could limit hate speech in itslef
__label__Support	Having a timed ban is a good way to discourage hate speech, teaching people to reconsider their language and helping to moderate the tone of the comment section without permanently banning people from the discussion.
__label__Position	I'm a firm believer of freedom of speech therefore eliminating it in any form especially because of something that can be regulated like hate speech, to me is ridiculous.
__label__Position	I think a simple moderation system should be sufficient to make sure hate speech is filtered out without suppressing readers' comments. It should probably be a real person wherever possible, however, to be able to appreciate the nuance of individual situations and to identify the way hate speech is often couched in hidden language which bots won't catch (Nazis using certain numbers or punctuation marks to mean racist things for example).
__label__Attack	How did you reach that conclusion? Regulation of comment sections has proven to be effective, as long as people are willing to help the platform by reporting these hate speeches so that it is properly dealt with.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	Hate speech is a form of verbal assault and should not be tolerated or encouraged.
__label__Attack	likely to commit hate crimes"
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Support	some words should be muted or not allowed to be used in newspapers, because they are offensive or they contribute to hate speech
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Attack	What is considered free speech (and should therefor be allowed) depends heavily on the location of the platform and the user. In the US free speech is protected by law to a much greater extend than in Europe. In the US there are only a few categories of speech not protected by the First Amendment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_free_speech_exceptions), like incitement to lawless action. In Europe however free speech stops there where it infringes on someone else their rights, for example the right to not be discriminated against. Racism and targeted hate for that reason is not protected by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights) or the national laws of many of the European countries.
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	I don't want to see the comments space removed as it amounts to censorship. I'd much rather that people saw what other people thought and were able to consider it. Hopefully, readers will recognise when some people are irrational and will not add fuel to the fire. Good moderators would help but they mustn't be trigger happy. They must allow dissent and only remove what it clearly offensive.
__label__Attack	There are those that are going to use the platform to incite hate and this should be moderated with them being banned if identified
__label__Support	I don't believe the comments section should be removed as everyone is entitled to a voice
__label__Attack	I think that you're right. I'd rather have the hate speech than restrict free speech.
__label__Position	I think with careful moderation, there's nothing wrong with keeping the comments section. Reddit is a fine example of extremely good moderation combined with bots that immediately remove content with insults and hatespeech.
__label__Support	I agree that with good moderation it is possible to create an environment where people can openly discuss topics.
__label__Support	The comment section should not be taken out instead, they should use software that is able to detect hate speech and not allow it to be posted
__label__Attack	Do you believe that people can actually be controlled. The audience will alway find a way to spread hate.
__label__Position	Educate people about it
__label__Attack	I agree - but how do we do it whilst giving readers some protection?
__label__Position	I think the best option would be to put some moderators that are educated about hateful speeches and let them see comments before they are online so that they can decide to approved them or not. They are doing it in Germany (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.2017793)
__label__Support	This is a good way of catching the hate speech before it's even aired and helping keep a nice environment
__label__Position	That could be an issue but I also think that doing nothing would be worst for our cultures
__label__Support	I agree with this point. Hate speech just spreads more hate among people.
__label__Position	Readers comments also give newspapers opportunity to improve, as some of the readers might also add things that they think the newspaper should improve on. taking the comment section out would also take away this opportunity from newspapers as they might not find out what their readers think. more education is need to reduce the impact of hate speech and also introducing technology that can deal with hate speech on the comment section.
__label__Position	As I mentioned earlier, it is not that hard to achieve a hate speech free online community through the use of moderators and bots. Here is a link to reddit's volunteer moderator guidelines they use to help their moderators be better. https://www.reddit.com/wiki/moddiquette/ If it's possible to achieve it with volunteers, imagine the effect you can have with paid and educated moderators. Another way of handling this would be to force people out of their anonimity by making it necessary to use their real ID to create an account on newspaper websites just like prolific and putting comments as a member only tool. By the addition of laws that take hate speech online as serious as hate speech on the streets, people could be fined for their inappropriate behaviour and possibly shunned in the society, just like they would in real life.
__label__Position	Hate speech poses grave dangers for the cohesion of a democratic society. It can lead to acts of violence and conflict on a wider scale.
__label__Position	some words should be muted or not allowed to be used in newspapers, because they are offensive or they contribute to hate speech
__label__Position	some words should be muted or not allowed to be used in newspapers, because they are offensive or they contribute to hate speech
__label__Attack	Hate speech undermines people
__label__Support	It is good to have a team that moderates and approves
__label__Attack	In my opinion freedom of speech stops when it is directed hate towards a person or a group of people. Online platforms do not have to tolerate hate speech on their platforms.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	Block any hateful words so comments can’t be left
__label__Position	by having a system or word check that will not allow users to use words that are considered as hate speech
__label__Position	There surely must be a role here for AI to monitor comments and flag any that warrant attention? Also encouraging and allowing other people to report them so that they can be removed.
__label__Position	I think before the comment being posted, the moderator should read first are they contain hate speech or not, if they contained hate speech they should give it mark/flag.
__label__Position	I think the best way to reduce hate speech in newspaper websites is to ensure that the site can detect words and phrases that can be considered hate speech, and block them from being posted on the comment section. Also, a moderator to approve each comment section before it becomes publicly accessible is a notion which can be adopted as well.
__label__Support	agree with this totally, and I think that was my opinion earlier
__label__Attack	I agree with you but there would have to be a lot of work put into the filters as people do get around them and still are able to make their hateful points using text speak or misspelling ever so slightly. This is just something that would have to be considered.
__label__Position	Could one option be that the owners of websites which allow commenting have to ensure - by whatever means - that instances of hate speech are dealt with in a certain time once reported or that they reduce it altogether by a certain amount otherwise they incur fines or suspension of the site. So they have to sign up to a policy or code of conduct or pratice? Although this link is about disinformation the principle is the same. https://digi.org.au/disinformation-code/
__label__Position	The summary of ideas in this topic is related to reducing hate speech in newspapers websites without eliminating the space for reader's comments. Many people are suggesting that moderators should be put in place to moderate each comment and approve it if it meets the required standards. Other debaters are arguing that there should be systems put in place to detect hate speech words and I think that would be a great initiative because it will help and ensure that the website space is conducive.
__label__Position	We believe national and international laws should ban hate speech including in the press. such feelings may stem from deeplyfelt.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a very serious problem and it is more evident online as anyone and everyone can write anything without fear. in as much as we all have freedom of speech, that freedom should not be used as a weapon against other people.
__label__Position	Newspaper websites should implement ways such as word filters, moderators and more strict rules and regulations to prevent post that include hate speech to be minimised. They can also educate people about the dangers of hate speech. "Fight back against harmful messages in public places by publicly standing with victims in solidarity" https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/combat-onlin-hate-speech/
__label__Attack	b
__label__Support	It will eliminate hate speech
__label__Position	Have a list of words that are banned from social media sites.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	this is just a response with no constructive information. We cannot just say this, throw up our hands and walk away
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	agree to some extent but it removes accountability from the journal itself.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Attack	Yes, I totally agree with this.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Attack	Unfortunately there will always be some who will abuse this freedom
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news.

__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	I think it's difficult to re-educate (so to speak) someone engaging in Hate Speech because the root cause is something within themselves. Unless a newspaper website wanted to fund a dedicated team to address and re-program the life long beliefs and internalised trauma that some racists, homophobes etc hold, then it seems an insurmountable task. The key would be to start at the ground floor and provide affordable therapy, mandatory counselling for offenders, pump more money into diversifying and fortifying the education system...
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	Moderate the comments sections!
__label__Attack	In principle a great idea, in practice this requires more money be spent on moderators and system updates
__label__Position	I disagree with eliminating the comment section. Some online newspapers manage to limit hate speech by using algorithms, which allow a free flow of ideas. It's not perfect, but the alternative of no comment section creates an echo chamber that is neither desirable, nor useful to the reader.
__label__Position	Monitor comments closely.
__label__Position	Make readers agree to not sharing hate speech and let them know that if they do, they will be blocked from commenting.
__label__Position	3. Running a media platform should come with a willingness to hear views of all kind
__label__Position	Readers should be allowed to share diffrent opinions but maybe the sytem or website should restrict certain vocabulary in the comment section.
__label__Position	Newspaper websites and media houses do not hold the responsibility of policing or censoring as they can easily manipulate such to their favour.
__label__Position	Is it actually their responsibilty?
__label__Attack	I think they hold some responsibility. But perhaps not in the way this survey is trying to determine. A free flow of ideas is necessary, which includes difficult and often cantankerous and vigorous differing opinions. It should be the responsibility of said sites to allow those types of opinions, but deal with the trolls that free and open debate often attract.
__label__Position	Hate speech is everywhere, not just in the newspaper
__label__Support	But that is not the question.
__label__Attack	Who gets to determine what exactly IS hate speech? It's a slippery slope that eventual will deem everything hate speech.
__label__Position	Maybe AI could filter hate speech
__label__Position	Address the problem at hand (hate speech) without involving others who have nothing to do with it.
__label__Position	I don't think you can reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without having a large team checking every post regularly or moderating posts before they appear in the comment section. Even if you eliminate the space for readers comments the hate speech will still happen, they will just find somewhere else to post it
__label__Position	I think there is a difference between expressing differing opinions, and trolling someone. If someone is making a valid alternative viewpoint in a polite and respectful way, that is fine. But if there are simply just insulting or threatening someone else, that is trolling and should be deleted.
__label__Position	My concern is how we efine hate speech vs expressing differing views. However we also have to be aware of the damage publishing incorrect facts can be.
__label__Position	As commenter DamienC mentioned, it's almost impossible to define Hate Speech without rigorous Academic insight and debate. It's possible that by having a comment section at all, you are saying 'I accept and allow any and all opinions be expressed here'
__label__Position	Upon reflection and a comment that PeterD made, I've re-considered my stance slightly. A good point has been made that journalistic integrity should sometimes be challenged and that becomes difficult when comment sections are removed. You could argue that feedback forms are one way of allowing work to be challenged but these are anonymous and thus impossible to regulate
__label__Support	This definitely needs human input, it's too sensitive a matter for machines!
__label__Support	Readers would ust become more comfortable because it now seems like a platform that has been opened for them to spread hate speech.
__label__Support	Flagging comments does work with limited effectiveness, however, like with social media, you will always invite people who want to censor anything they disagree with. Those individuals try to utilize flagging and reporting, ase a tool to bully those that they do not agree with. That is not an effective way to deal with actual hate speech.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Support	I don't think "ineffective" is right word to use, I think 80% of the suggestions would somehow have an effect on this because it it a measure after all, it may not completely address or eliminate hate speech but it will have an effect.
__label__Support	Eliminating the space for comments entirely will mean that each article is viewed through the lens of the journalist. This is not completely impartial but it does mean that harmful speech or radicalised opinions aren't present to muddy the waters
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Support	I completely agree. It's not the job of online sites to become speech police. I frequent many different online comment sections, and oddly enough, hateful comments are swiftly dealt with by other contributors. Sometimes the best way to eliminate hate speech, is to allow it to be seen, then vastly condemned by those seeing it. Algorithms should be used to deal with trolling. Honest, sometimes brutal comments should not censored just because they make others uncomfortable.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.

__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?

__label__Position	everyone should talk about themselves not other people because they will feel offended
__label__Position	we must make sure we read newspaper that are wrote by trusted authors
__label__Position	My position is that i think they should not be removed, but moderated
__label__Position	I don't think there is hate speech in newspapers
__label__Position	by arresting them
__label__Position	I don't think there is hate speech in newspapers
__label__Position	put news in polite ways and try to be civil and lastly put yourself in their shoes
__label__Position	We can reduce hate speech by using moderators to filter the comments before publishing.
__label__Position	People should be able to regulate their opinions so as to not encourage hateful speech.

__label__Position	Arguments for: hold debates elsewhere https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2015/sep/25/is-it-really-a-good-idea-to-turn-for-news-websites-to-turn-off-comments
__label__Support	I agree with this as it reflects my own view. Moderation is the way to go and not removal
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	you have a good point. If an algorithm could do that correctly that would be amazing
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Support	takes away the ability for people to express their hate
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	censoring/controlling speech in any way is a power that can be used to push a narrative, even with the best intentions in mind. The only way to have free and open debate is to not censor comments or ideas
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	who is in charge of moderating the conversation and who decides what is permitted to be discussed? Moderating conversation is a very dangerous precedent
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Support	If you want to get your version of the news without any context as to how it's received by the public this would be convenient
__label__Attack	newspapers are owned and have people to answer to financially, they are also driven by clicks and advertising revenue so you could be blinded without understanding feedback on a topic from the public
__label__Attack	Newspapers often weave opinion in to their presentation of the news, they don't always report just in a purely factual manner. No comment sections at all would stifle discussion.
__label__Position	Hate speech needs to be clearly defined, but once it is it should be defined and posted clearly somewhere on the website, for example 1) No disrespectful comments on the grounds of race or gender. Software or moderators can remove such comments. However this should not overreach to healthy debate, not every negative comment is hate speech.
__label__Position	you should autoban key hate speech words
__label__Attack	There are ways to circumvent the autobanning of words.
__label__Support	This is very sensible.
__label__Position	Removing the ability to discuss newspaper articles is not the answer. Moderation is one component but it should not be done in a heavy handed way and striking the right balance could be difficult. Hate speech keywords should be automatically blocked or removed and persistent offenders prevented from commenting. Using your real name doesn't stop hate speech, it just makes it easier for you to be found.
__label__Position	There is no easy answer when it comes to hate speech. While it is clearly a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be. That said, it is worth exploring different options to see what might work best. Perhaps a combination of education and enforcement could be most effective in reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	have an approval for each comment?
__label__Position	Don't use racial slurs, give limited space.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	who decides how the moderators moderate? This is too much power
__label__Support	it would be a less divisive place
__label__Attack	It is difficult to moderate in a completely unbiased way and it would not be right for moderation to influence opinion.
__label__Attack	Removal of hate speech is not too much power, but hate speech needs to be clearly defined and a set of rules adhered to.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I agree that limiting freedom of speech is not the solution. The algorithm should be able to pick up certain words/phrases that can then filter the hate speech.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	There is always going to be fake news, thats what sells. Hate speech is not the same as voicing an opinion.
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	It is possible to express opinions without being aggressive, but that doesn't mean people will do so. Online arguments often get very heated and can quickly devolve into hate and personal attacks- this should not be tolerated in forums meant for discussion of news
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Attack	There needs to be some form of restriction on the content of speech, can you imagine if everyone was given free reigh?
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Support	I agree with moderation and the need for education and increased open-mindedness and respect
__label__Attack	I don't agree with handing over a lot of personal data as this could be misused and seems like an overstep of personal freedoms and privacy
__label__Attack	I agree with you, online privacy is already a massive issue, I don't want to have to submit even more personal data (that could end up sold to advertisers) just to comment on an article. I also don't think 'tracking down' people who post hate speech online is practical or achievable.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	Active moderation of comment sections can be used to remove hate speech whilst maintaining spaces for civil discussion.
__label__Position	Community moderation is used on many platforms to allow discussion whilst preventing hate speech from arising, however this is greatly dependent on human participation which can take a lot of work depending on the size of the community. Additionally, the removal of hateful comments can better a comment section, but will not change a commenters views- this has led to the development of more insular online communities fostering these more extreme or hateful views. People will create a space for their commentary if there isn't one provided (or if their comments are removed from somewhere). A lot of this comes down to what a given newspaper wants to be associated with (in the sense of their brand) as opposed to maintaining the sanctity of online discussion.
__label__Position	I agree with AliceW. Fake news sells and attracts more people to read. However, voicing an opinion does not need to include hate speech.
__label__Position	Debate should be available upon all topics. To reduce this availability reduces the opportunities for people to express their opinions and undermines democratic processes. Hate speech should be managed and eliminated before publication.
__label__Attack	I agree, this has been seen on platforms in the past. This article about an online horse game shows an example of a moderation team going a little 'mad with power', being more harsh when dealing with mentions of politics they personally disagree with (banning people who mention being LGBT but not banning those saying similar things which imply them to be straight) https://www.themanequest.com/blog/2020/3/21/horse-isle-3-war-crimes-and-lgbtq-visibility-a-case-study-in-how-not-to-approach-community-management
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Hate speech is a probelm, and to discredit any potential help is not the answer. Trials and attempts could be made to fix this issue. A good way to do so would be to use human modetors who are netural, to ensure that there is fairness.
__label__Attack	This article shows the benefits that controlling hate speech has, especially on diverse groups. It would be wrong to not attempt to control this situation.
__label__Attack	There is clear evidence of the efficacy of different moderation practices because these have been used on various sites for years now.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Support	There is enough negativity in this world at the moment without adding to it with hate speech!
__label__Support	There is already far too much hate and violence in the world, without giving people platforms in which they can bully and name call.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__Support	moderators
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	I think moderation is required, along with algorithms to detect certain words or phrases known to be problematic
__label__Position	Algorithms to check for problematic words & phrases, Trigger Warnings should be provided by users, & Paid Moderators.
__label__Position	I really think that there should be properly paid moderators to do this work. People need employment, and I think many people would be happy to do this.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Support	Users who want to comment will find other ways of doing so such as via facebook or other social media channels. Free speech needs to be permitted otherwise a balance is not provided.
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Support	The root causes of the problem is not people commenting on newspapers, but how these ideas got into their minds. We need to work on education.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Support	I agree. Users should be able to to flag harmful comments and report them to a moderator. Users can also counteract damaging comments by refuting the content of the comment, for example, by refering to reliable sources
__label__Support	very true, people get too worked up online and post things they would never say IRL.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Support	I agree that there is no need for comment sections under newspaper articles when most of the comments end up being a form of hate speech. A separate platform to discuss these articles would be better as it could be more easily monitored.
__label__Attack	Eliminating the comments section won't stop hate speech: we have to work on the root of the problem
__label__Support	It's true that eliminating the comments section might be helpful to prevent some ideas to spread more quickly.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Attack	I believe that most people actually do realize the damage that hate speech can cause and are either deliberately using a platform to incite violence/harm/distress or just don't care as they dont see the people they are using hate speech against as being worth feeling for. There is enough research now to show the direct links between hate speech and hate crimes
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards.

This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Attack	I think people are so wary of giving personal information out online that this would put people off commenting and while this might deter 'keyboard warriors' who are happy to hide behind a screen I dont think it would be helpful to have the threat of being tracked down. It feels very big brother coercive and could potentially lead to people feeling attacked which may make them lash out but also feel justified in their opnions
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	Evidence from research (see attached) suggests that the comments section of a news article is better at creating discussion than outside sources, so comment sections in newspapers is important for nuanced discussion
__label__Position	Removing comment sections would be beneficial as hate speech can be very harmful to many groups of people, even if some would see it as eliminating free speech.
__label__Position	I think that as others have said we need to have comments sections as it gives a chance for people to point out different views and perhaps make corrections or point out exceptions. I hadnt thought about moderated comments sections before but it may be a good idea. Although there would need to be very clear guidelines on what constitutes hate speech I think or there might be the potential for something someone doesnt agree with to be incorrectely flagged
__label__Position	I think we need to think about the purpose of debate and how successful it really is in changing peoples minds. are people who engage in hate speech really open to discussion and changing their mind?
__label__Position	Hate speech is a problem but we do need to have debate. We need to respect different views and allow people to voice their opinion where necessary to further a debate on a news topic. Having the comments vetted before they appear does allow for some censorship but that must not be at the cost of open discussion.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a problem in a world that is becoming more and more polarised; our basic human rights and freedoms are in jeopardy if we can be subjected to violence just because of our race, gender, sexual orientation... It's important to work on the root of the problem and provide quality education from an early age so that children become more used to diversity. Eliminating space for readers comments won't prevent hate speech from existing, so it's just a patch to a bigger problem.
__label__Support	Should reduce hate speech and other inappropriate comments
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Attack	Hate speech is dangerous because words have power and can influence others to act. It is the denial of acts of tolerance, inclusion, diversity and the very essence of human rights norms and principles. Addressing and countering hate speech is, therefore, a necessity
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	Hate speech can cause unnecessary harm and the removal of a space for readers comments would overall be a good thing that would not take away from the experience of reading the articles.
__label__Attack	Although free speech is important, there is a lot of scientific evidence showing that hate speech, bullying and dehumanising language can do harm to individuals it is aimed at.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Support	I agrre with this
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Support	I think hate speech should not be accepted . If its published on news platform then that signifies that its is condoned!
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	Yes I agree many people are able to not get aggressive over a newspaper topic, however there are plenty that do, and allowing full expression of opinions without monitoring and consequences could lead to people being offended or bullied
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Attack	Surely these platforms could just end up filled with people who don't care about formulating a justified argument and post fake news instead. How do you monitor who is allowed to comment?
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Support	I agree with this comment there is no way to stop hate speaking but it can be done to draw a line and set up some limitations
__label__Support	Yes, I would be much more likely to post, read and respond to comments on a website location that is moderated and checked before posting
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Position	Have individuals read posts prior to publicizing. This allows to filter out any comments that are inappropriate.
__label__Position	MArginsand borders should be created that give opportunity to speak out negative feelings but this speach should not be aggressive and violent else the system should remove inappropriate messages from the database automaticly
__label__Position	Hate speech can be moderated in short terms and long term ways, Short term is moderators who moderate what is being posted. Secondly as the ability for readers to flag up inappropriate comments and thirdly delaying the live posts until it has been checked. Long term involves better education at schools
__label__Attack	Give option to delete bad comments
__label__Position	I agree with that
__label__Position	We can fairly reduce hate speech from newspapers websites without eliminating space for readers comments by encouraging people to give a reward who will comment without hate speech.
__label__Attack	People could just as easily reward negative and hateful comments if they agree with them
__label__Position	I believe one way to reduce hate speech is to have a 'report' button on the comments section, where people can flag up certain comments to the site's admin people, who can decide whether the comment is inappropriate.
__label__Position	report anyone as soon as it is seen so they can be dealt with and removed.
__label__Attack	People may be unsure what to define as an inappropriate comment, and we cannot guarantee that the comment will be removed
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	Disagree! people should be abl eto express themselves in a respectful manner.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Support	Hate speech must be moderated otherwise we are teaching future generation that is it acceptable
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Attack	Whilst I agree, not when people are spewing hate and creating a hateful echo chamber.
__label__Support	more moderation
__label__Attack	This may lead to insensitivity to other readers
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Support	but then how would that be any different to newspaper comments sections? the folk who write hateful comments would migrate to different platform, then you'd have the same problem just on a different platform.
__label__Support	covering both sides is great but we should be able to be respectful towards eachother
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)

__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Support	I definitely agree
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Support	I agree, the comment section should likely remain but be heavily moderated and regulated to disallow hate speech as the article above says
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	would authors be held to account still?
__label__Support	It should really be up to newspapers, but better no comment section than an unmoderated one
__label__Position	Block the idiots
__label__Position	Use moderators to regulate harmful posts
__label__Attack	Who will moderate it? Can local papers afford to hire people to moderate every comment?
__label__Support	Name and shame those that want to spout hate, I agree.
__label__Support	This can make it easier to ban an IP address
__label__Position	I think that keeping a comment section is overall good as it keeps engagement but needs to be heavily moderated and regulated so it doesn't just dissolve into a lot of hate speech and grounds for radicalisation
__label__Support	Agree, as you can read here > https://accessiblelaw.untdallas.edu/limits-free-speech-social-media
__label__Position	Removing the option to comment is limiting engagement, but hate speech should be moderated and dealt with by having people create an account and fill in a name.
__label__Position	Well I think it just comes down to the companies running the comment section. They need to prioritise curbing hate speech in their comments. But that costs them money and they may not want to do it. I don't think you can ever make it "fair" but at the end of the day it's a private company and they can ban hate speech if they want to
__label__Position	Hopefully we have solved this issue by now. Mission accomplished!
__label__Support	yes this is the best way to reduce hate speech while still allowing readers to comment their opinion
__label__Attack	WHile the definition in general can apply to most types of hate speech, there is one flaw, which can be illustrated by the following statement: "I don't care about your race, religion or gender. I do not like you because you are an idiot (or stupid)". Is that hate speech or an expression of opinion?
__label__Position	This UNESCO document describes how anonymity and the transnational structure of the internet makes addressing hate speech difficult, but defining hate speech is a first step. https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000233231
__label__Position	by moderating the comments
__label__Position	Maybe introduce somesort of advanced AI to filter and flag anything along those lines
__label__Position	Have human and AI to verify potential hateful speech. Given our current resources we should be able to allocate a human check given the rating of the flag by the AI
__label__Support	Yes i agree to that and it will limit those hate speech
__label__Position	The comments sections need to be more heavily moderated. The comments section shouldn't be closed as we have a right to express our opinions but some commenters should be banned if they express purely hateful comments. Comment sections on the daily mail have been described as hateful cesspits, which can be true with people spouting hateful bullying comments. Therefore more moderation is needed to ensure people can still express themselves, but purely vile comments aren't allowed.
__label__Position	I agree with most of the commenters here, there needs to be moderation. Even if you don't agree with the arguments there are ways of saying it that do not fall into 'hate speech'.
__label__Position	It is easy, a moderation commitee should be be set to audit comments before posting them.
__label__Position	Again, a committee should be set to properly scrutinize the comments before they are uploaded.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Attack	reduces free speech
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Support	I agree that anybody being allowed to comment can give rise to fake news in comment sections
__label__Attack	I don't believe that anybody who had the capacity to give rise to fake news can do something more powerful than commenting, and I think that filters being put into place would be more productive than completely eliminating to option to comment - this phenomenon will always exist and can easily take place on other platforms regardless
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Support	Discussions helps to deepen learning, to remove it completely would hinder what you could know but they need to be monitored for sure. Hate speech is not okay.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.

__label__Position	I think people should be encouraged to give personal comments however they need to be monitored to ensure hate speech cannot be seen which might negatively impact others
__label__Support	Yes, I fully agree with this. Everyone should be allowed the opportunity to comment, however the comments should be monitored because as much as everyone has the right to freedom of speech ,it must not negatively affect the next person.
__label__Position	There needs to be filters put on key words to remove the posts. There needs to be moderators in place in order to monitor threads and people being abusive need to be banned.
__label__Position	There has to be teams of employees working with the newspaper that are checking what has been said and deciding whether certain comments need to be removed. I don't think getting rid of comment boxes is the answer, just careful monitoring and banning of accounts that use hate speech.
__label__Position	comments need to be monitored and able to be reported by other readers
__label__Position	I still think comments should be monitored by AI for certain phrases and reactions. A reporting feature can be used to flag posts and remove them either by AI or a real person
__label__Position	As long as there is a good hate speech policy and auditing them comments should remain. Check out what twitter does to keep their platform free of hate speech
__label__Attack	They can already do this, take a look at social media policy and they can, but choose not to in fear of going against freedome of speech.
__label__Support	100% correct
__label__Position	https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/enforcement-options
__label__Position	Algorithms are a must to cut out hate speech. Allowing only paying subscribers is elitist but necessary as being traceable is important.
__label__Position	Freedom of speech is a fascist fallacy. I love readers comments but there has to be very strict controls to control hate speech. I agree with the suggestions to have monitoring of comments by AI; able to be reported on by other users; and only allow registered site users to post comments.

__label__Position	The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is interestingly tackled in this article: https://www.wired.co.uk/article/online-stubbornness
__label__Position	The problem of readers comments providing an echo chamber for polarised views is often used as a reason not to have readers comments. It seems that this is not a fair argument for eliminating readers comments because of the psychological phenomenon of "cognitive dissonance" - we automatically search for echo chambers in any context.

__label__Attack	just because readers comments should be allowed does not mean that they should not be filtered within some capacity to prevent hate speech and discriminatory comments
__label__Position	Filters should be put into place in order to prevent hate speech in readers comments, filtering specific words that should not be accepted. This will allow readers to give their opinions and consider others', without giving rise to hate speech
__label__Position	I support the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence as an option to identify hate speech, in particular hate speech that is directed at specific peoples or designed to incite violent, aggressive or destructive behaviour
__label__Position	I agree with this article about fining large social media companies if they fail to reduce the volume of abusive content on their platform. https://www.latrobe.edu.au/nest/can-combat-rise-online-hate-speech/ This gives the company a clear incentive to build technology that reduces this unsociable behaviour on an inherently social platform
__label__Support	Yes, I totally agree with this. Actually, I think this might be the solution to this problem. If comments are moderated before they go public then there is no chance that offensive and inappropriate comments will make it to the public comments section.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.

__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	Free speech cannot just be cited at every occasions when the comments people make are criminal. Free speech is not an opportunity to break the law.
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	I agree that hate speech is a serious issue, still newspaper commenting is also needed.
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Position	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Attack	Removes possibility to have conversations which help move us forward
__label__Support	Hate speech is not acceptable and this would help to prevent the possibly of appearing online.
__label__Attack	If comments are present they should not be regulated. People should not allow themselves to be personally offended by the opinions of others. People have a right to their own beliefs and opinions.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	I agree! This is truly the best solution out there at this point and time. It is scientifically proven that one is more careful about how one expresses one's feelings when he knows he is not under anonymity.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	Removing the comment section will not prevent hate speech from occurring. People will find an alternative online platform, e.g. forums. Instead, companies should focus on moderating the comment section/providing links as to why posts that may be flagged are harmful. We need to focus more on prevention as opposed to reaction.
__label__Position	I think that if you still want people to be able to comment their opinions you won't be able to stop hate speech. The only practical way to reduce it would be to have someone monitoring the comments or have someone approving whether comments go public.
__label__Position	Better real-time monitoring of posts, either by AI or human monitoring (or combination of both). Another way is to reuire ID to sign up so as each comment is linked to someone who can be identified. This would surely reduce the instances of hate speech, and help catch those who take part in such hate speech.
__label__Position	I think that if we eliminate the space for people to comment its unfare and people will still comment on it elsewhere wher eit may be monitored less. I agree that making the person enter some sort of identifying info before commenting will reduce the hate speech because they will not be anonymous. This along with monitoring of the comments should reduce the amount of hate speech.
__label__Position	I don't think that readers' comments are necessary on a newspaper site. There are a plethora of other platforms on which people can engage in discussion and share opinions. I don't believe that removing the comments will have an overall impact on hate speech however. If people choose to behave in that manner, they will find a place to do it regardless.
__label__Support	I totally agree!
__label__Support	It is absolutely true!
__label__Support	I agree that requiring ID, and utilising AI should greatly reduce hate speech
__label__Position	I think we need to develop a way to recognize hate speech in comments so that it is easy to monitor comment sections for derogatory and offensive language. There are studies on how to go about this for example if you follow this link it talks about "A Feature-Based Approach to Assess Hate Speech in User Comments" https://www.cairn.info/revue-questions-de-communication-2020-2-page-529.htm
__label__Support	I agree that with the current level of technology there is no problem as to monitoring comment sections for offensive language. This can be easily removed.
__label__Support	The comment space gives users a way to vent out their frustration. It is not always nice to see derogatory language but when there is a healthy discussion, it helps people reading them to find very informative.
__label__Position	This study and many others are useful ways to make sure that individuals are still able to express their opinions while limiting comments that are unhelpful and hurtful to certain individuals.
__label__Attack	Who gets to decide what constitutes a 'controversial topic'? This is still a form of censorship and should not be allowed.
__label__Support	I agree. Accountability is extremly important for public confidence, so very important that this happens
__label__Position	People can give opinions on something they like or dislike, like foods or entertainment but 'opinions' on the rights or existence of a marginalised group is not the same thing. It's easy to say that people shouldn't be angry at the opinions of others, but when that opinion is that you don't deserve to live because of something you have no control over i.e race, gender, sexuality - is a whole different thing.
__label__Position	Freedom of speech is not freedom of consequence. The paradox of tolerance is a very good example of why intolerant or hate speech is not the same as having the freedom to express your dislike of something that is not a person's identity or existence. To have the opinion that a group of people deserves to die simply because they are a certain race is an intolerant, disgusting, and genocidal belief. That should not be tolerated.
__label__Position	Newspapers should have an algorithm that catches certain words or phrases which are hateful in nature. These words will be automatically flagged up and accounts that are flagged x amount of times should then be restricted from commenting for a period of time. If after this period, they continue to try and post comments with hateful content, they should be banned entirely from commenting.
__label__Position	One way to possibly deal with hate speech on newspaper websites would be to have moderators that work around the clock monitoring for hate speech and removing such hateful comments and banning those people that engage in hate speech.
__label__Position	Create an obligation for companies to have thorough moderation software/employees that review comments before they are available for the public to see. This retains freedom of speech but ensures that anyone posting anything morally or legally reprehensible is prevented from doing so.
__label__Position	A possible way to address hate speech on newspaper sites would be to incorporate both human moderators and some sort of AI that monitors for hateful words and comments. The requirement to submit personally identifying information before commenting might also help because without this then anyone can create a fake name that hides the person's true identity so therefore more likely to engage in hate speech. If personal information is required, then hate speech would be less likely.
__label__Position	Could we potentially invest in education or public information campaigns about the impact of hate speech, perhaps using popular figures e.g. Marcus Rashford?
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.

__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.

__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.

__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	Concise opinions
__label__Support	No alternative views
__label__Support	No fact checking
__label__Attack	There needs to be some space to discuss the news to encourage conversation and fact checking.
__label__Position	All discussions on forums should be monitored. Key words must be identified related to hate speech and trigger an IT system to remove the post. Writers must be warned (written warnings) must be sent, after for example 2 warnings they will be banned from the website for a certain time. If hate speech is extreme and could bring potential harm, a report at authorities must be brought on.
__label__Position	There needs to be rules and regulations stating the type of comments that can be made about other people. There should also be verification of a persons identity everytime they make a comment so that is visible who the statement was made by. Newspaper articles should constantly ready and delete hate speech comment.
__label__Attack	I understand what you're saying in regard to rules and regulations, but people will still disregard it in order to state their opinion.
__label__Support	Verification of identity is a useful suggestion as users may be more scared of consequences if they can be identified from their comments.
__label__Position	lets just have a completely open space for discussion and everybody is informed of this before entering the comment section.
__label__Attack	have to be careful with banned lists, sometimes they dont do what theyre meant to
__label__Attack	Simply using a word filter would not be enough. One of the things that makes hate speech so dangerous is that the people saying it know how to get around word filters to say hateful things without using banned words. Word lists would also trigger false positives and potentially stop constructive discussion about the issue .
__label__Position	Free speech is a hallmark stance with any respectable democracy. Rather than eliminating readers comments, instead readers should be reminded that care should be taken to deliver their opinions with respect. It is never necessary to use derogatory language or expletives to get a point across. Otherwise, adults should be allowed to engage one another in discourse without the fear of their comments being taken down or censored.
__label__Position	Implementing consequences (such as bans, threats of police involvement etc) for users spewing hate speech in comment sections. Verifying user identities and only allowing verified users to comment, being able to trace an account back to a real person will make users more afraid of consequences and hopefully encourage them to be kind.
__label__Position	I don't think any attempts should be made to block or censor anything. Yes I,m Gen X, yes I gre up with the old adage "sticks and stones make break my bones but words will never touch me" . It aint true, but its a good way to live your life.
__label__Position	All this talk about educating one another or educating the perpetrators sounds like youre all in favour of mass reeducation China style
__label__Position	This is a fine point. I agree wholeheartedly with you. Education and showing people how to engage in proper discourse is key. I would also add to this that people need to learn how to receive other people's opinions without taking it personally or being overly sensitive. Overall, this is an interesting problem facing society with the advent of the internet and social media.

As stated by the Council of Europe, "Any restrictions on hate speech should not be misused to silence minorities and to suppress criticism of official policies, political opposition or religious beliefs." - https://www.coe.int/en/web/european-commission-against-racism-and-intolerance/hate-speech-and-violence. It's also important to clear define what is hate speech and what isn't hate speech.
__label__Position	Filter comments or have a ban on words that come across as hateful.
__label__Attack	lowers the risk of hate speech being needed
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Attack	Exactly, it's a slippery slope when a system is doing all the work https://www.cairn.info/revue-questions-de-communication-2020-2-page-529.htm
__label__Support	Hate speech can definitely be address in a way that doesn't hamper freedom of speech, but also penalize people from exciting violence and hate towards other. The following article provides some useful ideas on how we can do this as a society: https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/combat-online-hate-speech/
__label__Support	let ppl get all their vile thoughts out in the open and then we know who is who
__label__Attack	hate speech is not protected under the right to free speech, as it incites violence and bigotry. Therefore, newspaper websites should take measures to reduce hate speech in order to create a more inclusive and tolerant environment.
__label__Support	While hate speech should not be tolerated, newspaper websites should not be solely responsible for reducing it. Instead, government and law enforcement should take measures to punish those who engage in hate speech, and society as a whole should work to create an environment in which hate speech is not tolerated.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	I believe that newspaper articles know the consequences of any article they put up and the kind of comments that may arise from such, it is therefor their responsibility to prevent such from occuring.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Attack	Who decides what is categorised as Hate Speech?
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Position	Hate speech blocking should not disallow free speech, but should address the root causes of the problem
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Support	Agreed.
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Attack	You are creating a divide between the news and how people interpret it
__label__Position	newspapers already cover various apinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public apinion would be involved also
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Support	Agree
__label__Support	I agree too. I think technology is more advanced now and AI could be used to filter comments
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	No room for intelligent discussion
__label__Support	Reduction of hateful and harmful speech
__label__Attack	Newspapers should be neutral, but you find that they are often the ones who actually instigate hate speech
__label__Position	There should be moderation reviewers to delete harmful comments
__label__Position	appreciate people have different views
__label__Position	Could setup a forum so that people can comment there and not directly under the comments. Then moderate the forum?
__label__Position	I think removing comments might not be the best approach as I find important for people to be able to express their opinion. The best approach would be to moderate comments and invest in AI to automatically be able to identify or flag comments possibly linked to hate speech.
__label__Position	We could introduce a system online where it automatically filters out bad language or hate speech by using key words.
__label__Position	We could introduce a system online where it automatically filters out bad language or hate speech by using key words.
__label__Attack	and what do we filter?
__label__Position	Comment sections should be removed altogether in order to reduce hate speech and harm especially to vulnerable communities.
__label__Position	I think the comments should be monitored to avoid hate speech
__label__Position	I think giving particulars when you comment will help with accountability
__label__Position	I personally think hate speech shouldnt be reduced, althou it is hate and can hurt some people, it is those types of comments that makes you stronger at the end and learn how to ignore ignorend stupid blabber mouth people.
__label__Position	Having the option for complete anonimity and alter egos should be removed. I believe people will be much more careful with what they say if their name and face is attached to it.
__label__Support	that the hatter can be revield
__label__Position	yes so if they have something bad to say then they will be revield
__label__Attack	Allowing those to post it anonymously gives them the okay to do it over and over again without being called out over it.
__label__Attack	I totally agree. There are people who like to read comments. It is also a right to express an opinion.
__label__Position	I merely believe that if steps are taken we can combat fake news and hate speech responsibly.
__label__Position	I believe nowadays a lot of solutions exist to help moderate content if newspaper are not able to create and manage their own. For example solution like the one attached below are something you can start using immediately: https://viafoura.com/content-moderation/

__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Support	Hate speech can be defined as speech that is intended to hurt, offend, or intimidate someone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. It is important to ban hate speech because it can lead to acts of violence.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	But is the comment space from a newspaper website the right place to represent your opinion?
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Attack	Most readers don't know that comments are turned off https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/
__label__Attack	Most readers don't know that comments are turned off https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/dont-read-the-comments-for-news-sites-it-might-be-worth-the-effort/
__label__Support	I have to say, this is my thoughts. I feel there is already too much of this going on, so the media oliagarchs can direct things politically.
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging.

__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Support	Yeah. That's true anyway. Freedom of speech is good but protecting the citizens and preventing violence through hate speech is also great
__label__Position	I'd say yes...I"m not entirely clear if anyone reads comments and it elicts a change in opinion on any subject...degernerates into name calling.
__label__Position	readers comments be moderated and anything that is harmful, hateful or hurtful should be removed. this allows people to exercise their right of freedom of speech but limiting the harm that someones opinion may have
__label__Attack	How dow we establish what harm is?
__label__Attack	it removes the right of freedom of speech
__label__Attack	Freedom of speech comes with a responsibilty, and if people are not responsible with their rights, there should be measures put into place to fix that
__label__Position	By having a designated team to check all comments before they are made public: if comments contain hate speech, they should not make it onto the the final comment section.
__label__Support	i like this idea and it allows the reader to rethink what they have wrote instead of it being taken down
__label__Support	Yes there should be restrictions in the form of vetting comments before publishing it
__label__Attack	can be subjective what someone views as hate speech someone else might not agree
__label__Attack	Surely this would depend on the opinions and ideas of the moderators in some cases unless they followed some standards such as what the UN outline here on hate speech... https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/what-is-hate-speech
__label__Position	reducing hate speech on the newspaper websites is possible without taking the drastic measures of completely cancelling the comment section one way of doing that there should be moderators who approve the comment before they are published on the website.

__label__Position	I'm having trouble reading the comments on here. The page keeps moving. I can only confirm what I have already written that comments should be allowed but would have to be moderated in some way. I don't know how this would happen, since there could be too many comments for a human to police. Perhaps a combination of a bot checking comments and a real human might work. I don't think you will completely eliminate hate speech because everyone has different life experiences. It should be up to the individual to realise what makes sense instead of enforcing a kind of nanny state. People should be able to make up their own minds. The issue happens when you become the target and how it can affect you personally. However, I still believe that we need freedom of speech and the only way to stop it is to police the comments and discourage by criminalising it to empower victims.

__label__Position	Freedom of speech is a right but the right should not be violated
__label__Position	I totally agree with this stance. With today's advanced technology, AI can and should be used to detect hate speech, and thereafter filter it out. https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2019/04/09/how-should-social-media-platforms-combat-misinformation-and-hate-speech/
__label__Position	However many newspapers have chosen to cancel out the commenting section on the newspaper websites saying that they prefer that their readers comment on their social media platforms as they will still post there and they will not cancel or remove the comment section.
__label__Position	The comment section should not be removed because it is a way of communicating with the public. Rather they must be rules to regulate people's comments.https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2015/sep/25/is-it-really-a-good-idea-to-turn-for-news-websites-to-turn-off-comments
__label__Position	Yes freedom of speech is a right and it should not be violated. In the same breath that right should not be abused or used to violate the rights of others. https://www.amnesty.eu/news/freedom-of-speech-carries-responsibilities-for-all-0250/
__label__Position	enhancement through education on media laws and ethics
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Attack	i dont believe eliminating the space for readers comments is the right thing, readers should be allowed to comment and moderators can be used to reduce harmful/hateful speech
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Attack	Allowing hate speech, only perpetuates prejudice and discrimination.

__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	Comment section is very good to have so that people can freely voice their opinion like a gazette or white paper for government. Can be reduced by creating a filter out programe to remove key words of hate speech
__label__Position	One thing that is clear is that we can't just remove the comment section. Researchers have found out that this is not a good strategy at all.

__label__Position	According to the UN website, the solution to hate speech is not reducing free speech, but rather increasing it. This allows conversation and exchange of ideas, so people can see other people's point of view and develop empathy. This has been proven to reduce hate speech overall
__label__Position	Another study that I found against the removal of comment sections can be found here: https://www.techdirt.com/2021/11/08/killing-website-comment-sections-wasnt-brilliant-move-many-newsroom-leaders-assumed/
__label__Position	https://www.debatingeurope.eu/2021/09/07/do-social-media-bans-violate-free-speech/#.Y1F1DHbMJPY The consensus of the debate seems to be not to restrict free speech, but rather to have a system in place to prevent hate speech and misinformation.
__label__Position	My belief is that comment spaces should not be removed but heavily moderated. The article linked here contains comments from experts / bloggers, whose general consesus is that comments are welcome but should be heavily moderated: https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/sep/12/comment-sections-toxic-moderation Interestingly, the writer of the article has no love for comment sections but sees the value in strict moderation.

__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.

__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Attack	I agree, reducing freedom of speech is never could. Using an algorithm can be quite useful, however it can open the whole group of structural problems, when not all hate speech is treated equally. https://time.com/5739688/facebook-hate-speech-languages/
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Attack	I also agree this is a good solution
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Support	I agree, I think that first of all we you write a public comment commons sense and education should be used... I think that common sense is a way not to Support and discourage have comments
__label__Attack	But then who would be in charge of deciding the restrictions and certain circumstances?
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	Elimination is not a solution, education and deliberation is
__label__Attack	A website having the ability to gain enough personal information on you is dangerous. This is dangerous for anybody whether their comment was hate speech or not. Hackers and third parties can gain access to that information.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	I don't agree, it just needs to be monitored whether by ai or human
__label__Position	have moderators monitor the comments and delete innapropriate comments. use an algorythm to pick out certain hate speech words and delete the response, and block the writer from the chat.
__label__Position	multiple moderators and a strict system is key. my employing multiple people as moderators, you can make sure that there is not a single person making decisions from their own point of view. you should have different people with different opinions on the same team to make sure that the fairest outcome is guaranteed. if all else fails, there should be a set of rules that help make the decision
__label__Support	The freedom of expression must be preserved, the comment section can also help to educate people and make them reach different points of view
__label__Attack	Having real people that moderate comments on a newspaper website where there are thousands of comments is unrealistic. At best you could have an algorithm that auto bans comments that contain key words and/or phrases and then have those reviewed by a real person.
__label__Position	Have monitoring software be used. The comment section should not be removed, because it then deprives the general public of their opinion and freedom of speech as well as addressing any inaccuracies that were mentioned in articles.
__label__Support	i think so too, there must be software to instyruct an algorhythm to pick out certain hate words and delete the comment
__label__Position	We need to consider everyone has there own opinion and entitled to give this, it just needs to be managed so that is is done fairly and responsibly.
__label__Attack	i dont agree, it is too controlling , there needs to be a middle ground of moderating
__label__Position	Hateful comments can have a real impact on some people. It is important to have a strong algorithm and moderation team working together. Right now there are loopholes that allow people to get through the computer system that humans can fix.
__label__Position	Use a BOT to regulate hateful comments
__label__Attack	Sometimes computer algorithms get things wrong
__label__Position	Hateful comments could be hurtful towards the person/people that the article is about and cause them to become upset and possibly negatively affect their mental health.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Attack	good idea, my worry is that using human paid moderators wilol push up the cost of newspaper subscriptions
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Attack	While it is true that any attempts to reduce hate speech could have negative consequences, this does not mean that we should not try to reduce it. We should balance the potential negative consequences against the potential benefits of reducing hate speech.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Position	Hate speech is a form of discrimination and violence, and that it should not be tolerated under any circumstances, even if that means eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Attack	I agree that sometime it may be needed, but how do we decide what that "less restricted" criteria should be?
__label__Attack	I quite agree but it is not the priority for newspapers website to create a whole new platform. So maybe it is too fastidious
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Position	I think nowadays newspapers are not that much powerful. there are other a lot platforms to spread the words. ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Support	This could provoke some people to actually post hate speech hoping it will be read by some before it's removed?
__label__Support	In which case it may be better to actually *remove* the comments altogether, than overwrite them with the "this comment was removed due to hate speech policy" or "this comment was flagged as inappropriate".
__label__Attack	Violating the right to freedom of speech
__label__Attack	then where can conversations happen which might help people expand their positions?
__label__Attack	there can be nuanced discussion that will be lost if certain words or terms are automatically disallowed. People will find a way around as soon as things are banned
__label__Support	there are some words which are universally offensive and never add to discussion
__label__Support	I agree because it will be easy to identify hate speech like this without completely taking away the ability to express opinions
__label__Attack	is achievable
__label__Support	needs to be installed
__label__Attack	Have you heard of the Scunthorpe problem? It is the fallacy of exactly this argument. If somebody wants to say something, they will find a way. Let's say "tomato" was a word that the algorithm blocked. An algorithm which isn't aggressive enough wouldn't block "tom**o" or "2m8o", etc. Even if these were blocked, users could decide on a euphemism which everybody means knows "tomato". Let's say they choose "vine". If the algorithm is too aggressive, then a friendly discussion on French vineyards would be impossible! See if you can see why it's called the Scunthorpe problem!
__label__Position	I have no real interest in reading readers comments sections in newspapers, but I don't agree that they should be eliminated. The content can be moderated to remove hate speech. This be done by a moderator, or these days, by AI.
__label__Position	i think the use of a moderator would help but also a warning or disclaimer should be put out for readers, it should clearly state what is considered hate speech and what the consequences for the reader's comment will be if they are found to contain hate speech.
__label__Position	Completely removing the comment section is out of the question. How else is the audience supposed to interact with the material and each other? the feedback could be useful to the writer too for future articles pertaining to similar topics.
__label__Support	agree, the comment section is an important tool to exchange your opinion with others
__label__Position	difficult to control but an important question is, by banning hate speech are we missing the opportunity to change minds? https://www.npr.org/2019/10/10/768894901/how-twitter-helped-change-the-mind-of-a-westboro-baptist-church-member
__label__Position	Two words: Scunthorpe problem. https://digitalcommons.butler.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5933&context=wordways
__label__Position	Nearly all countries have hate speech legislation. There are certain things you are not free to say and rightly so. There is an onus on Newspapers not to let their websites be vehicles for people to spread hate speech. Strict moderation is needed and these days it is relatively easy to implement. There is no need to get rid of readers comments sections.
__label__Position	After some thinking I have come up with suggestions to improve the comment section from newspapers without removing them entirely. 1) Include a rules section for commenters to abide by and agree to before commenting, such as keep opinions courteous and don't instigate a fight. 2) Comments are not automatically submitted. Before shown to the public moderators will review them, make sure they follow the rules previously posted and - if so - publish them for all to see.
__label__Position	https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1461670X.2014.972076
__label__Support	I like the idea of allowing readers to flag comments deemed as inappropriate, perhaps with a limit of how many they can do, otherwise I can see some taking advantage of this feature and flagging every comment they disagree with.
__label__Support	This will create a more civil environment on the website, and that it would allow readers to feel more comfortable commenting knowing that there is a mechanism in place to remove truly hateful comments.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	I would largely agree that free speech is arguably more important than eliminating hate speech.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	While hate speech is a problem, newspaper websites have a responsibility to ensure that their readers are not subjected to it. Censoring comments is a necessary step to take in order to protect readers from hateful or abusive speech.
__label__Position	Reducing the freedom of speech on public articles is not the solution for avoiding hate speech. The way of using an algorithm which can observe and in case it is necessary remove / mark hate speech is a better choice.
__label__Attack	I think that even people can flaw in determining if something is really hate speech or if it is actually only against their beleifs
__label__Attack	I agree with maryam karimi. Algorithm is not flexible enough. Some words and opinions can not be heard in this way. The one who controls algorithm will have too much power if there is no mechanism to supervise him/her.
__label__Support	Yes, algorithms developed alongside the countries law makers and governing bodies could help reduce legally defined hate speech without making room for petty vendetas or the silencing of free speech.
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	posting hate is not freedom of speech
__label__Position	in some circumstances it can work. for example When it is done without consideration for the content of the speech or the speaker's point of view, it might be restricted under a less strict criteria.
__label__Position	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Position	I think newspapers should cancel de comment space because it can create hate speech and fake news. In order for people to develop their arguments against of for a specific news there should be platforms that discuss this types of information. The creation of these sites could diminish the polarized opinions towards a specific news, but I don ́t think that the newspaper should be the place to comment
__label__Attack	I agree, most of the times comment sections only generate polarizarion
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Position	I think that the one of hate speech is an issue nowaday, but the solution is not cutting out any possibility of discussion but to bring on an education policy on these issues in order to raise awareness on the problem (because most of the times people don't realize the damage they create by writing such things)
__label__Support	I agree

ANd also nowadays people are getting really used to comment on most of the things even ıf they dont have an idea. Sometimes that create fake news. Preventing them from comment section maybe greed them to dig in and do something powerful other then commenting.
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Support	This post was very funny :)
__label__Position	This is right. Sometimes after I was reading the news I am checking comment sections and seeing someones comment that was saying thats not correct and she/he was even giving sources. or sometimes I see a comment about the latest situaiton of the topic from a comment. that happens.
__label__Position	In order to reduce hate speeches there should not be any comment section. Newspapers should be one sided providers.
__label__Attack	If that was the case, how would you go about allowing commenting on newspaper and journalist points (which are often really problematic) but very hard to counteract?
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	This removes balanced media consumption (people will get even more stuck in echo chambers!) and the idea of free-press means that there should be freedom to cross-examine
__label__Position	A high level buy in is needed for reducing hate speech from newspapers websites without eliminating space for readers comments
__label__Attack	Cybersecurity would have to be very strong if you mean physical addresses...
__label__Attack	This would surely reduce discussion. People should be free to contribute without having to give up their privacy.
__label__Position	yes we can if its in sighting direct violence however we have to agree on what the limit is then on this freedom of speech, equally we need to restrict it to just give people in power a position to censor too. its a tough one. If people could handle bad comments it wouldnt matter
__label__Position	I think that it depends a lot on ow the comment section is presented - is it an extension of the article itself or a separate section that needs to be viewed separately. How much legitimacy is the the platform giving to the comment section.
__label__Position	It may be a good idea to involve some form of moderators to check if there are any hate speeches. Aggressive comments may be censored accordingly. However, we need to be careful in doing this as some may have negative effect as silencing voices.
__label__Support	most topics have at least 2 opinions
__label__Position	I believe in free but appropriate speech; nothing racist, homphobic etc or hateful.
__label__Position	need all speech so we can change opinions of the bad people
__label__Position	Policy level intervention may be necessary. It is supported by the research; see for example the paper published in Social Science Research: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0049089X16303222?via%3Dihub
__label__Position	Stop calling it hate speech maybe it is just another opinion
__label__Position	I think that definition of hatespeech needs to be laid out clearly as I think different people have different ideas on what constitutes hatespeech - perhaps if there was a kind of premediation that informs the user that what they are engaging in qualifies as hatespeech it may make them more likely to reconsider their messages introducing a form of self moderation as well as external moderation
__label__Position	It may be useful to have some form of online policing force to moderate the newspaper website. This is suggested by the research published in Police Practice and Research: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15614263.2021.1919109
__label__Support	I think that this is correct but mst places have a law or legal guideline as to what it considered hatespeech n that country
__label__Position	there needs to be some form of ceneorship of what newspaper can post i dont mean full censorship i just mean around things realating to hate of certain group
__label__Attack	hate speech doesnt allways include certain hateful word so wont work in all cases
__label__Position	have moderators and also have a rating system so people who comment alot and are safe and seen as realible people can be given access to report post which will then be hidden untill a mod can read and make a finale descion of the post.
__label__Position	I agree to have moderators and have key words flagged up and not allow certain words that can accelerate arguments. Have an email option to send in points of view that can be published for readers to be able to read a balanced view of a debate.
__label__Position	To summarise my thinking, I maintain the view that certain offensive words/phrases should be automatically blocked, and that a manual reporting feature should be implemented to resolve other concerns.
__label__Position	https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech/understanding-hate-speech/hate-speech-versus-freedom-of-speech According to the UN, it can be difficult to moderate hate speech due to not wanting to violate people’s right to free speech. The article linked here appears to favour educating and responding to the comment writers rather than eliminating their comments entirely.
__label__Position	Education and moderation is key but it will never be enough to eliminate hate speech. People are entitled to speak their opinions and should be able to do so. Moderation could also be undertaken by the readers themselves, flagging any alarming posts for moderators to check. Sadly there will always be a way online these days to preach hate and bullying and it is very difficult to counteract. Newspapers need to take responsibility for the article’s that they publish and be aware of how the general public may react.
__label__Position	Websites could be held accountable and fined for any online harassment or hate speech online.
__label__Support	This would allow discussion while at the same time ensuring a system is in place to reduce harm/offense.
__label__Attack	It would be difficult to find enough moderators to review all of the comments on a website, and that some comments would inevitably slip through the cracks. Additionally, some people might abuse the flagging system by flagging comments they simply don't agree with, rather than those that are actually hateful.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Support	moderation is good
__label__Support	if newspaper websites take measures to reduce hate speech, such as by moderating comments or by banning certain words, this will help to create a more civil and respectful environment online.
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Support	hate speech is not free speech
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Are you sure about this? The algorithms that detect hate speech online can be biased too. No?
__label__Support	I understand the point, and in the case of using an algorithm/censorship, it must be proven that the positions are not restricted. An independent service, which is neutrally positioned and only detects comments by the use of insults or hate speech, would be necessary for this.
__label__Support	I agree that it is the current solution for hate speech as not all the comments are appropriate to public, although the algorithm is not perfect and need to be developed
__label__Support	I think the comments space can be made in a manner to highlight hate pushing or driven behaviours
__label__Attack	Agree
__label__Position	Everybody should be able to express its own idea. But at the main time, it is possible to do it without being aggressive.
__label__Attack	True, in detail without being disrespectful or bullying
__label__Attack	it is so difficult to stop that, if you follow a newspaper on instagram, you will see that comments are allowed. Everyone can create an account in every social media, newspapers too
__label__Support	It doesn't give a space for hate speech
__label__Position	That will give the newspapers unilateral power in producing and selling information without any censorship. Which will also produce other repercussions
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Attack	I disagree, people that use hate speech are fully aware, especially if it is related to a newspaper article.
__label__Attack	Still I believe that hate speech online should be removed as soon as identified to reduce the further damage it can make to the target individuals and others.
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Position	Comment space enhances social participation and should not be completely eliminated. Nevertheless, it could be regulated by setting some standards. It should not be disrespectful to others. Given the fact that it should support tolerance and open mindedness, hate speech could be removed
__label__Position	Discussions should be encouraged but with moderators who consistently monitor and regulate comments that maybe harmful or damaging. The solution lies in education and the rewiring of perspectives to cultivate values such as open-mindedness and respect in people. Perhaps another solution to reduce/discourage hate speech could be that before someone is able to post a comment, a significant amount of personal data/information has to be submitted, so that it is possible to track down people who participate in hate speech and attempt to re-educate them. This would make people more aware of their actions online and refrain from posting comments that are not beneficial to the discussion.
__label__Support	Maybe ıt would trigger a movement to investigate ıssues by the public. Instead of easily believe and support (even sometimes be fan) or hate and not even search.
__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Attack	Less moderation and legal issues
__label__Attack	This limits free speech and reader engagement
__label__Attack	This is an invasion of privacy.
__label__Position	Very good question, we live in a digital era now. I think the readers comments can be used on social media platforms
__label__Attack	Less people will be willing to pay.
__label__Attack	Reduced number of readers because of the cost of purchase.
__label__Support	Making people pay would make you think before signing up to add comments.
__label__Position	It's a balance. There should be the ability to pre- and post-moderate comments. Pre- using technology to recognise potentially offensive words as well as closer moderation of articles on potentially controversial topics. Post-moderation to allow readers to report offensive topics which will be hidden from view until moderated.
__label__Support	i think they should have a filtering software to remove hate speech words and from being posted on the newspaper websites.
__label__Position	Giving you views should be done in a nonoffensive and informative way. Using hate speech should be curtailed and all who do prosecuted. To allow this to happen post must be moderated and traceable. Signing onto a service will pay for this and add traceability.
__label__Position	The way to fairly reduce hate speech is to use a mix of technology and human intervention to manage the potential volume of moderation required to provide a healthy environment for discussion. There are a number of tools available that allow for pre- and post-moderation to curb the worst excesses of user comments. This can be further enhanced by requiring readers to give a little more data about themselves to reduce the anonymity which provides a cloak for the potentially worst expressions of hatred.
__label__Position	Although it might be unfair for others, I think majority can agree that removing the comment section will be helpful because then it means anyone that has an opinion can rather call the newspaper.
__label__Position	I think that the website should develop a hate speech filtering software, to remove all offensive words that might be of hate speech.
__label__Position	the website should have terms and conditions on the words that can be used and warnings if failure to follow the recommended words .
__label__Position	I don't think algorithms are the answer. They need to be very, very sophisticated otherwise they require a human mediator.
__label__Support	They might sift a bit
__label__Attack	Algorithms aren't that sophisticated. They might miss stuff, or label as hate speech something that isn't
__label__Attack	Agree. I dont believe there would be one sophisticated enough to deal with this
__label__Attack	Modern life has moved on from my world view in this regard; I probably shouldn't be taken as any kind of sensible benchmark.
__label__Support	Self-opinion is illogical at times, but people are entitled to whatever non-harmful opinions they like. Except in the case of psychics and other charlatans.
__label__Support	You make a good point - why do we need to give a platform for people to just say mean things hiding behind their computers when they wouldn't say that in real life.
__label__Position	Having read all of the previous discussion surrounding this debate, I still stand by my original opinion. Moderating comments by an official representative of the newspaper doesn't allow for free speech. We do however, need to eliminate hate speech. I think the best way to do this is to put this in the hands of the community and other readers.
__label__Position	Hate speech online absolutely must be eliminated and we should not encourage it within online platforms. Hate speech can and does lead to violence which is more severe than 'being horrible online'. https://www.coe.int/web/european-commission-against-racism-and-intolerance/hate-speech-and-violence
__label__Position	But newspapers and media outlets have guidelines and evidence-based (usually) rules to stick to; the general public in a comments section don't have any such instruction and thus their opinion will be weighted differently, without evidence.
__label__Position	There's lots of evidence of the impact of hate speech and the damage it can cause to individual's mental health https://www.un.org/en/hate-speech. https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cyber.2022.0009?journalCode=cyber
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted.

__label__Attack	This is like saying if there are less weeds in the garden there is less work. The weeds grow. We have to address the weeds.
__label__Attack	it also highlights the wider problem in society
__label__Support	Another benefit of reducing hate speech is that it could make it easier to prosecute people who engage in hate crimes. If there is less hate speech, there will be less evidence of a hate crime, making it harder for the perpetrator to claim that the crime was not motivated by hate.
__label__Support	Agree and we should not give a platform for this.
__label__Support	i kind of agree... If you tell someone the news and they respond with hate speech, it's not your fault or your responsibility to silence them
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
__label__Attack	it is not a problem solver but giving people the opportunity to publicly write in this way is kinda advocating for hate speech and crimes

__label__Support	I agree
__label__Position	This comment was removed due to hate speech policy
__label__Support	I like your irony. Good way to make the point! Indeed removing comments after they have been posted makes existing conversation broken in a way. Difficult to find the flow of the conversation if pieces of it are removed
__label__Support	Good use of removal
__label__Attack	I want to see the opinion. Say no to the spanish inquisition
__label__Attack	People should be able to read things they don't like or agree with.

__label__Position	I think having moderators who check the comments and remove any that contain hate speech is the best way of reducing it.
__label__Position	comments should be allowed on newspaper articles so that people can have a discussion and express their opinions, regulation would ultimately ensure that everything is kept in order.
__label__Attack	when regulating the comments someone will always disagree or challenge the rules. Claim free speech has gone mad etc.
__label__Position	There are plenty of other platforms for people to comment on the news, this can be done while keeping the author or the items subject private. Therefore, less effected, sometimes people talk/type before thinking about the ramifications.
__label__Position	As well as having a screening process, I think there shouldn't be an option to anonymise someones comment. People are less inclined to troll if they have their name and face attached to a profile.
__label__Position	Say no to censorship
__label__Position	Use automated algorythums

__label__Attack	Manpower intensive
__label__Support	Easy to do
__label__Attack	there are ways to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not clear how effective any measures to reduce it would be, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Support	Algorithums
__label__Attack	I think the whole concept of hate speech is nonsense and completely hypocritical.
__label__Support	There are many potential benefits to reducing hate speech, such as making it easier for people to express their opinions without fear of harassment, making it easier for people to access information without being bombarded with hateful messages, and reducing the overall level of hatred and bigotry in society.
__label__Support	zero pros
__label__Attack	Some people argue that hate speech should not be banned because it is a form of free speech. They believe that banning hate speech would be a form of censorship.
__label__Position	The comment section is the space for everyone to present their opinion, and removing that is not the solution for avoiding the scenarios of hate speech.
__label__Attack	Maybe clarification of some points can be produced, or sometimes some news needs to be objected inorder to stop spreading fake newses
__label__Attack	I believe thats an accurate solution
__label__Attack	I think comments may be used to explore causes of a problem...but hate contents do not always have this goal
__label__Attack	I agree with Richard in so far as newspapers to this point mostly haven't had very successful moderating systems. Either they are unaware of current methods of spreading misinformation or they bring down the ban hammer so quickly that it makes their comments confusing
__label__Support	As this topic is quite new there are some observations and guidelines from newspapers on what they do. I think there is some wisdom to be learnt from comparing the policies of diffierent companies to make a best practice. https://netino.fr/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/WAN-IFRA_Online_Commenting.pdf\
__label__Attack	I think even the news released by newspapers should face criticism otherwise there are chances of promoting fake news. So, the comment sections are useful in some scenarios.
__label__Support	I agree
__label__Support	agreed, but sometimes trolls know full well the damage they do so there is a subset of people that it is impossible to have fair discussion with because they only want to provoke negative reactions

__label__Attack	newspapers already cover various opinions from diffrent paerties so its already not a one sided profile its good that the public opinion would be involved also
__label__Support	This will eliminate hate speech
__label__Position	In order to do this I believe comments to be moderated, by people on both sides of the argument. Hate speech accounts should be automatically banned
__label__Position	we can reduce the hate speech by keeping control on what people can say and sometimes you can automatically ban certain words being used
__label__Position	There are ways to monitor hate speech online without it all being up to people having to always monitor it themselves. there is increasing technology online that can help with this https://gsdrc.org/publications/methods-for-monitoring-and-mapping-online-hate-speech/
__label__Position	I do not believe that removing the comment section of newspapers really helps too much in preventing hate speech as most hate speech is spread in general social media more than in comment sections. However I do not believe that newspapers have any obligation to even have comment sections. Newspapers were traditionally something that you read and discussed in other locations with people. The newspapers of the past had no obligation to print people's letters etc. If newspapers have comment sections they should be moderated to avoid hate speech
__label__Position	Hate speech is subjective and as such should not be censored.
__label__Position	There will always be haters - it is human nature. To eliminate hate speech you would have to eliminate the comments space. If newspapers want to keep the comments space, then constant moderation would be necessary.
__label__Position	Hate Speech must be properly defined and published in the form of a rule/guideline before comment moderation can occur.
__label__Position	All members of the public should be asked to create online profiles in order to add comments. If anyone then writes harmful comments the can be tracked and their account can be terminated.
__label__Position	Freedom of speech can also make people take advantage of false data and spread rumours.
__label__Position	There are a few ways to fairly reduce hate speech from newspaper websites without eliminating space for readers comments. One way would be to have a team of moderators who are responsible for approving or disapproving comments before they are posted. Another way would be to allow readers to flag comments as inappropriate, and then have those comments automatically hidden from view until a moderator can review them.
__label__Position	Any attempts to reduce hate speech from newspaper websites will be ineffective, and that the only way to eliminate it is to eliminate space for readers comments altogether.
__label__Position	An extremely polarised position on this topic might be that hate speech should be allowed to flourish on newspaper websites as it is a form of free speech, and that any attempts to reduce it would be an infringement on this right.
__label__Attack	Hate speech online has real-world consequences, and can lead to actual violence and bigotry. Therefore, it is important to take measures to reduce hate speech in order to protect vulnerable groups.

__label__Support	Helps prevent mental illnesses via online platforms.
__label__Position	While hate speech is a problem, it is not the responsibility of newspaper websites to police it, and that any attempts to do so could have negative consequences such as silencing valid criticism or curtailing freedom of speech.
__label__Attack	Newspaper websites should not be in the business of censorship, and any attempts to reduce hate speech could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas.
